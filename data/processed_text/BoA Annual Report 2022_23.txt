12 ANNUAL REPORT 2022/23
On behalf of the Board of Directors of the Bank of 
Abyssinia S.C and myself, it is an honor to present the 
Board of Directors’ Report along with the Audited Financial 
Statements of the Bank to the 27th Ordinary Annual General 
Meeting of Shareholders for the Fiscal Year 2022/23 that 
ended June 30, 2023. 
Fiscal Year 2022/23 featured a set of socioeconomic 
and geopolitical challenges in the global economy with 
notable repercussions on the financial industry. The global 
economic activity that demonstrated some resilience 
remained weak by historical standards owing mainly to the 
rise in central banks’ policy rates in a bid to fight inflation, 
which continued to weigh on economic activity worldwide 
(IMF WEO update, July 2023). The policy tightening by 
central banks in response to inflation has brought about 
high economic costs, such as high borrowing costs for 
emerging and developing economies, constraining room for 
priority investments, and raising the risk of debt distress. 
As a result, output losses remained large and the global 
economic growth rate is believed to have slowed down to 
3.0% in 2023 from 3.5% in 2022.  
The Ethiopian economy also faced a number of interlocking 
challenges during the year. The economy has been 
suffering from ongoing conflicts with impact on normal 
economic operations and development. On top of the 
security challenges, macroeconomic imbalances such as 
persistent inflation and foreign exchange shortage, and 
food insecurity and drought prevalence have also added 
to the economy’s ailments. The unabated inflationary 
pressure has exacerbated cost of doing business affecting 
the industry. Nevertheless, according to IMF’s report of 
April 2023, the economy managed to register a positive 
economic growth estimated to be 6.1% during FY 2022/23. 
Ethiopia has begun to implement a series of economic 
reforms and took steps to give impetus to digital economy 
which entailed a number of policy and regulatory changes. 
Such changes include the provision of license to non-
bank financial service provider institutions to engage 
in payment and other financial services such as telcos 
and payment instrument issuers. Other reform steps of 
great significance for the financial industry as well as the 
economy, taken during the year, include the enactment of 
policy direction for the opening up of the banking business 
for foreign investors and steps for the establishment of a 
functioning capital market. Numerous policy changes were 
also introduced during the year by the government, with the 
view of setting forth prudential regulation and monetary 
management, such as requirements of banks to purchase 
government treasury bonds, and amendment to payment 
system proclamation. All these developments present both 
opportunities as well as threats in the form of intensified 
competition to the incumbents.

HONORABLE SHAREHOLDERS,
Message of the  
Board Chairperson
Bank of Abyssinia has once again 
proved to have built up a strong 
capability and internal strength by 
registering a commendable set of 
results during the year in the major 
indicators, having passed through 
testing environment dynamics.  
Accordingly, the Bank has achieved 
growth in assets by 26.81% and an 
increase in profitability by 12.36% 
under the duress of such a competitive 
market and tough macroeconomic 
conditions.
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
Bank of Abyssinia has once again proved to have built up 
a strong capability and internal strength by registering a 
commendable set of results during the year in the major 
indicators, having passed through testing environment 
dynamics. 
Accordingly, the Bank has achieved growth in assets 
by 26.81% and an increase in profitability by 12.36% 
under the duress of such a competitive market and tough 
macroeconomic conditions. Total assets have increased 
by Birr 40.15 billion over that of last year and reached Birr 
189.60 billion, while the Bank earned a gross profit (before 
tax) of Birr 5.23 billion representing an increase of Birr 
574.13 million from that of the preceding year. Deposits 
increased by Birr 36.49 billion, which is a 29.89% growth 
over that of the preceding year, and the total deposits 
amount was raised to Birr 158.54 billion as at June 30, 
2023. Total loans and advances increased by 29.27% from 
last year’s position and reached Birr 146.51 billion (P+I).
The Bank’s interest free banking business has also made 
progress. During the year, the Bank mobilized a total of Birr 
6.04 billion in IFB deposits, which brought total IFB deposits 
to Birr 18.07 billion. In addition, the Bank has been increasing 
its interest free financing products, and outstanding 
financing has become Birr 3.03 billion as at June 30, 2023. 
The Bank shall continue to further strengthen IFB services 
with more innovative products and service offerings 
tailored to the needs and preferences of customers. The 
number and composition of service outlets across the Bank 
in which the Bank extends IFB services have increased over 
time accompanied by enhanced operational efficiency and 
service excellence.
During the year, the Board, the Management and employees 
have collectively invested time and energy in navigating 
through the tough environment to bolster the Bank’s resilience 
and to keep the growth momentum. In this regard, the Bank 
has conducted various strategic initiatives and plans of 
actions that have been implemented to safely cut through the 
operational impediments, and hence which were instrumental 
in managing regulatory requirements and sustaining the 
Bank’s growth and profitability.
The Bank expanded customer service outlets both in branch 
openings and in innovative digital banking services. In this 
connection the Bank’s number of branches grew to 849 
while more ATMs, PoS terminals and virtual banking centers 
were launched during the year.
The Bank has continued its custom of introducing innovative 
and value-adding digital banking solutions, one of which 
is the launching of the Apollo Digital Bank, which is a fully 
digital banking solution, a first of its kind to the market, that 
enables customers to get nearly all the services they get at 
branch offices from the comfort of their mobile phones. The 
service offering is picking up popularity and growing fast 
among customers. 
Aimed at enhancing efficiency and effectiveness, the Bank 
has also undertaken activities/initiatives in IT among which 
the upgrading of the core banking system (CBS) to the 
latest version and the acquiring of PCI DSS certification 
are notable ones. During the year the Bank has successfully 
upgraded its CBS to the latest version which enables the 
optimization of service processing overall. In the same way, 
the Bank got certified for PCI DSS compliance version 3.2.1 
after successful implementation of the project. As PCI DSS 
is a continuous engagement, the Bank proceeds with the 
security exercises and remains compliant. In addition, the 
Bank has implemented a set of IT security management 
programs that would enable the safe and secure conduct 
of the Bank’s business in an era of continually disrupting 
digital banking and IT services space.
14 ANNUAL REPORT 2022/23
The Bank has continued its 
custom of introducing innovative 
and value-adding digital 
banking solutions, one of which 
is the launching of the Apollo 
Digital Bank, which is a fully 
digital banking solution, a first of 
its kind to the market.
The Bank’s human resources management was another 
area of strategic intervention in which the Bank has made 
big strides by implementing a range of HR development 
programs. 
These 
programs 
cover 
all-rounded 
HR 
management practices with impactful and long term 
benefits to the Bank and staff development, which include 
talent development, performance management, and career 
and succession management. All of these implemented 
programs will be vital in building organizational and HR 
capabilities that would elevate the Bank’s potential for 
transcending its long-term goals and aspirations.  
In a continued effort to create conducive working 
environment and service provision, the Bank is constructing 
a number of corporate buildings across the Country, 
and a lot of works were done towards finalizing ongoing 
construction projects. In this regard, the Ras Branch 
Building construction works progressed well and the ground 
to fourth floors are near completion. The construction 
works of the Bank’s future Headquarters Building Project 
around Mexico Square in Addis kicked off during the year 
wherein most of the project’s initial phase works, such as, 
site mobilization and shoring works are performed with 
subsequent tasks well underway. 
HONORABLE SHAREHOLDERS, 
Cognizant of the fact that the Bank operates in an ever-
changing business environment, the Bank strives to stay 
adequately informed of the environment dynamic so as 
to chart out courses appropriately and sustain the Bank’s 
growth and profitability. The banking industry is poised to 
confront stiffer competition across banking and payment 
services as newly joined banks and non-bank players which 
recently came in shall gather strength, while new entrants, 
both local and foreign, are to be welcome, and other reform 
initiatives by the government strike ground. Since the years 
ahead are expected to present more challenges as well as 
opportunities, the Bank’s management and Board shall keep 
track of developments, striving to convert opportunities 
into business prospects while at the same time staying 
vigilant to overcome business risks.
The Board of Directors, as always, closely follows the 
environment dynamics in order to set the Bank’s journey in 
the right direction to meet the Bank’s aspirations. 
The upcoming fiscal year marks the end of the term for the 
incumbent Board, which is poised to welcome an incoming 
Board of Directors for the Bank which shall take up and 
advance the strategic guidance and oversight roles with 
utmost commitment and dedication. 
I am confident that, with the support of all stakeholders on 
our side, Bank of Abyssinia will uphold its unique capabilities 
of delivering on key strategic objectives in the years ahead, 
and register higher financial and operational results to the 
satisfaction of stakeholders.
Finally, on behalf of the Board of Directors and myself, I 
express my sincere gratitude to our esteemed customers 
for their continued business connections with us. I would 
also like to thank our shareholders for their support, my 
fellow members of the Board of Directors, the Executive 
Management and employees of BoA for their dedication 
and commitment, and the National Bank of Ethiopia for its 
guidance and support. 
Thank you all,
Mekonnen Manyazewal

ANNUAL REPORT 2022/23
I am greatly honored to present to you the annual performance 
report of the Bank of Abyssinia for the fiscal year 2022/23. 
During the reporting period, Bank of Abyssinia has registered 
remarkable growth in asset, and across financial and 
operational areas amid the challenges faced in the operating 
environment. The year 2022/23 witnessed a number of 
hindrances in the world economy which was in a state of 
recovery, albeit weak, from the forces that affected growth 
in 2022. Global inflation remained high which forced cost of 
borrowing to rise, constraining economic activity in most of 
advanced economies, and at the same time elevating the debt 
costs of developing economies. 
The domestic economy has also been experiencing 
challenges owing to internal conflicts, global spillover 
effects, and macroeconomic forces such as high inflation 
and foreign currency shortages. These situations have 
affected socioeconomic activities which naturally include 
the financial industry. During the fiscal year under review, 
the banking sector, in general, has been operating under 
elusive conditions arising from instability due to intermittent 
conflicts in parts of the country that restricted business 
activities.
Having gone through such challenging situations, and with the 
coordinated effort of the Bank’s Board of Directors, Executive 
Management and staff, Bank of Abyssinia has achieved 
commendable growth in asset and earnings. Total assets of 
the Bank have significantly increased to Birr 189.51 billion in 
the reporting year from Birr 149.45 billion in the preceding 
year, indicating a 26.81% increment. The Bank has also 
registered growth in profitability as profit before tax reached 
Birr 5.23 billion this year from Birr 4.65 billion last year, up by 
12.36%. Furthermore, the Bank achieved incremental deposit 
growth of Birr 36.49 billion, the highest among private banks, 
while the total deposit reached Birr 158.54 billion, including 
IFB deposits. 
The Bank’s interest-free banking activities have strengthened 
further, and an outstanding performance was registered in 
incremental IFB deposits amounting to Birr 6.04 billion and 
raised the total IFB deposits to Birr 18.07 billion. The total 
outstanding loans and advances amount (P+I) reached Birr 
146.51 billion, showing a 29.27% increase over that of the 
preceding year. While much progress has been observed 
in the financing of Abyssinia Ameen customers, which has 
increased to Birr 3.03 billion, the Bank is prepared to scale up 
the financing to its esteemed customers. 
The Bank’s equity growth was commendable during the 
year with a total equity growth of Birr 5.44 billion, which is, 
a 38.28% rise, while share capital showed an increase of Birr 
3.58 billion, a 43.02% annual growth.
Message of the  
Chief Executive Officer
The Bank’s virtual banking centers 
reached 20 with additional 4 
centers launched during the 
reporting year. The Bank has further 
increased the number of ATM and 
PoS terminals deployed,
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
18 ANNUAL REPORT 2022/23
Bank of Abyssinia has stepped up the expansion of 
accessibility to customers through modern technology and 
digital channels, in addition to the opening of branch outlets. 
The Bank’s virtual banking centers reached 20 with additional 
4 centers launched during the reporting year. The Bank has 
further increased the number of ATM and PoS terminals 
deployed, as well as expanded the service availability and 
the number and volume of digital transactions. The Bank’s 
agent banking has kept expanding during the year wherein 
the agent and merchant network has increased to 15,003 
agents and 49,977 merchants across the Country. In this 
connection, as part of the continuous improvement works 
and with the view of further enhancing the Bank’s Gizepay 
services and VBC services, adjustments have been made in 
the organizational setup after the conduct of careful study 
and situational assessment. Accordingly, the agent and 
virtual banking has been reorganized in a manner to upscale 
the agent and merchant networks as well as VBC operations 
with new and innovative modes of operation. During the 
year, the Bank has opened 123 additional branches bringing 
the total number of branches to 849.
The Bank’s customer base both on traditional and digital 
banking platforms has increased over the reporting year, 
and the number of deposit account holders reached 
10.3 million out of which Interest-Free Banking accounts 
constituted more than 1.46 million. In addition, there were 
2.94 million card holders, and 2.76 million mobile banking 
users, while the number of internet banking users reached 
nearly 64,000.
With a view to satisfying the ever-changing customer needs 
and to expand service opportunities, the Bank continued 
investing in digital banking service expansion. In a nation 
where the youth constitute the majority of the population, 
providing tailor-made digital products will help to attract 
this economically active section of society and thereby 
ensure the Bank’s sustainable growth. In line with that, the 
Bank has introduced a number of service improvements 
and newly added innovative digital banking products and 
solutions. 
During the past year the Bank has executed notable tasks 
aimed at ensuring service excellence and efficiency, such 
as upgrading the core banking system to the latest version 
of R22, which enables to rendering of much optimized and 
efficient services to customers, as well as improves internal 
processes from the back end with added functionalities. 
The Bank also got certified for PCI DSS compliance (version 
3.2.1) which uplifts the security standards for protecting 
cardholder account data and privacy.
The Apollo Project also got traction during the year, with 
full-blown operationalization that incorporates a range of 
services including micro loans. Furthermore, the Bank has 
introduced a new service, ‘banking on wheels’, which is a 
pioneering banking option in the country. These efforts 
not only enhanced the Bank’s capacity to process the 
ever growing transactions at any given time, but most 
importantly to meet the evolving customer service needs, 
security, and convenience.  
RESPECTED SHAREHOLDERS,
Observing the tides of time, we foresee that the upcoming 
Fiscal Year is anticipated to present yet another set of 
challenges to the banking industry ranging from faltering 
security situations in parts of the country to high inflation 
which will apparently cause a diminutive appetite for

investment and weakened economic activities in the 
affected areas. There will, however, be wide opportunities 
as well, which our Bank will note of and move along in a

sustain the streak of good performance. The Bank shall 
capitalize on its competitive advantage, opportunities in 
the market, and readily available dedicated and committed 
management and staff to meet organizational goals. 
The Bank shall be engaged in crafting its strategic plan 
in the coming Fiscal Year taking into account the overall

The Bank’s steadfast resolve of delivering superior value to 
its customers shall continue and it shall keep on investing in

adding service offerings, that have garnered the attention 
of the general public thus far, which will ultimately bear fruit 
in attracting new customers and retaining existing ones.  
With the well-established governance, oversight, and 
leadership received from the Board of Directors, and the 
strong commitment and dedication from the Executive 
Management and staff, I am confident that the Bank will 
achieve its profitability and growth objectives in the coming 
year too. 
In my final remarks, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude 
to our esteemed customers, and the Bank’s shareholders

Along with its conventional banking service, the Bank of 
Abyssinia introduced an interest-free banking service 
named “Ameen” in December 2017 in accordance with 
NBE Directive No. SBB/51/2011. The name of this service 
was derived from the Arabic word meaning “faithful, 
trustworthy, honest, or truthful”, representing the Bank’s 
commitment to providing ethical, transparent, and reliable 
Sharia-compliant services to its clients.
As part of its four-year strategic plan, Bank of Abyssinia 
revamped its interest-free banking service, rebranding it as 
AbyssiniAmeen with the tagline “Committed to Respect Your 
Values” and unveiled a range of new products and services 
aimed at achieving widespread customer satisfaction.
For the facilitation of its Sharia-compliant operations, 
Abyssinia Ameen uses a robust interest-free core banking 
platform called iMAL, which the Bank launched for the first 
time in Ethiopia in 2021. iMAL offers a broad and complete 
set of capabilities, flexibility, and compliance with AAOIFI’s 
Sharia and accounting standards.

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the

the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements management is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis for 
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to close  operations, or has no realistic

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from

considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C
STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023
1. GENERAL INFORMATION 
Bank of Abyssinia (“the Bank”) is a public owned share company domiciled in Ethiopia.  The Bank was established in 
(1996) in accordance with the Licensing & Supervision of Banking Business Proclamation No. 84/1994 (as amended 
by 592/2008) and the Commercial Code of Ethiopia of 1960. The Bank opened branches throughout the Country. 
The Bank’s registered office is at: 
Ras Branch 
Legehar Building 
Gambia Street  
P. O. Box 12947 
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia 
The Bank is principally engaged in the provision of diverse range of financial products and services to a wholesale, 
retail and SME client’s base in Ethiopian Market. 
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
2.1. Introduction to summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below:
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.2. 
Basis of Preparation
The financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2023 have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).  Additional 
information required by national regulations is included where appropriate.
The financial statements comprise the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the statement 
of financial position, the statement of changes in equity, the statement of cash flows and the notes to the financial 
statements.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern principle under the historical cost 
concept, except for the following;
• 
Assets held for sale – measured at fair value less cost of disposal, and
• 
Defined employee benefit obligation measured at fair value;
• 
Equity Investment at fair value through other comprehensive income are measured at fair value.
All values are rounded to the nearest thousand except when otherwise indicated. The financial statements are 
presented in thousands of Ethiopian Birr (Birr ‘000). 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates.  It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Bank’s accounting 
policies.  Changes in assumptions may have a significant impact on the financial statements in the period the 
assumptions changed.  Management believes that the underlying assumptions are appropriate and that the Bank’s 
financial statements therefore present the financial position and results fairly.  The areas involving a higher degree 
of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are 
disclosed in Note 4.

2.2.1. 
Going concern 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The management have no doubt that the 
Bank will remain in existence after 12 months. 
2.2.2. 
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures  
i. 
New standards, amendments, interpretations effective and adopted during the year
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods 
beginning after 1 July 2022 with earlier applications are permitted which have not been applied in preparing these 
financial statements. 
Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2
1-Jan-23
Definition of Accounting Estimates - Amendments to IAS 8
1-Jan-23
Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction – Amendments to IAS 12
1-Jan-23
International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules - Amendments to IAS 12
1-Jan-23
Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 
The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by:
• 
Replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their ‘significant accounting policies’ with a requirement to 
disclose ‘material accounting policy information’  
And
• 
Adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy 
disclosures.  
Definition of Accounting Estimates - Amendments to IAS 8
The amendments clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies 
and the correction of errors. Also, they clarify how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop 
accounting estimates. 
Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction - Amendments to IAS 12 
The amendments clarify that where payments that settle a liability are deductible for tax purposes, it is a matter of 
judgement (having considered the applicable tax law) whether such deductions are attributable for tax purposes to 
the liability recognised in the financial statements (and interest expense) or to the related asset component (and 
interest expense). 
International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules - Amendments to IAS 12 
In May 2023, the Board issued amendments to IAS 12, which introduce a mandatory exception in IAS 
12 from recognising and disclosing deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes. 
The amendments clarify that IAS 12 applies to income taxes arising from tax law enacted or substantively enacted to 
implement the Pillar Two Model Rules published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development

(OECD), including tax law that implements qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes. Such tax legislation, and the 
income taxes arising from it, are referred to as ‘Pillar Two legislation’ and ‘Pillar Two income taxes’, respectively.
ii. 
New Standards, amendments, interpretations issued but not yet effective.
These changes are not early adopted by the bank 
Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Non-current Liabilities with Covenants 
- Amendments to IAS 1
1-Jan-24
Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback – Amendments to IFRS 16
1-Jan-24
Disclosures: Supplier Finance Arrangements - Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7
1-Jan-24

Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28
1-Jan-24
Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1)
1-Jan-24
Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Non-current Liabilities with Covenants - Amendments to IAS 1
The amendments clarify:
• 
What is meant by a right to defer settlement
• 
That a right to defer settlement must exist at the end of the reporting period
• 
That classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right
• 
That only if an embedded derivative in a convertible liability is itself an equity instrument would the terms of a 
liability not impact its classification 
Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback – Amendments to IFRS 16 
The amendment to IFRS 16 Leases specifies the requirements that a seller-lessee uses in measuring the lease liability 
arising in a sale and leaseback transaction ,to ensure the seller-lessee does not recognise any amount of the gain or 
loss that relates to the right of use it retains. 
Disclosures: Supplier Finance Arrangements - Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7
The amendments clarify the characteristics of supplier finance arrangements. In these arrangements, one or more finance 
providers pay amounts an entity owes to its suppliers.  
The entity agrees to settle those amounts with the finance providers according to the terms and conditions of the 
arrangements, either at the same date or at a later date than that on which the finance providers pay the entity’s suppliers.
Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture – Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28
The amendments address the conflict between IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in 
Associates and Joint Ventures in dealing with the loss of control of a subsidiary that is sold or contributed to an associate 
or joint venture. 
Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1) 
The amendment clarifies how conditions with which an entity must comply within twelve months after the reporting 
period affect the classification of a liability.

2.3. 
 Functional currency & transalation of foreign currency 
a. 
Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Bank operates(“the functional currency”). The functional currency and presenation 
currency of the Bank is the Ethiopian Birr. 
b. 
Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into Birr using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Monetary items denominated in foreign currency are translated using the closing rate as at the 
reporting date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from 
the translation of year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, 
are recognized in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. 
At the end of a reporting period non-monetary items carried at historical amounts continue to be measured 
using transaction-date exchange rates, monetary items are retranslated using the closing rate and non-monetary 
items carried at fair value are measured at valuation-date exchange rates. 
2.4. 
Financial instruments 
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity.  
2.4.1. 
Financial assets  
2.4.1.1. Initial recognition and measurement  
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through 
other comprehensive income (OCI), and fair value through profit or loss. 
The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow 
characteristics and the Bank’s business model for managing them. The Bank initially measures a financial asset at its 
fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. 
In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or debt instruments at fair value through 
OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount 
outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level.  
The Bank’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to 
generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash 
flows, selling the financial assets, or both. 
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or 
convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognized on the settlement date, i.e., the date that the Bank 
receives the asset on purchase or delivers the asset on sale.  
2.4.1.2. Subsequent measurement  
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:
• 
Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments) 
• 
Financial assets at fair value through OCI with recycling of cumulative gains and  Losses (debt instruments) 
52 ANNUAL REPORT 2022/23
BANK OF ABYSSINIA 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023
• 
Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon de-
recognition (equity instruments)
• 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. 
i. 
Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments) 
This category is the most relevant to the Bank. The Bank measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of 
the following conditions are met: The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold 
financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding.
Financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest (EIR) method and are 
subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is de-recognized, modified 
or impaired.
ii. 
Financial assets at fair value through OCI (debt instruments) 
The Bank measures debt instruments at fair value through OCI if both of the following conditions are met: 
The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective of both holding to collect contractual cash 
flows and selling; and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that 
are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
For debt instruments at fair value through OCI, interest income, foreign exchange revaluation and impairment 
losses or reversals are recognized in profit or loss and computed in the same manner as for financial assets 
measured at amortised cost. 
The remaining fair value changes are recognized in OCI. Upon de-recognition, the cumulative fair value change 
recognized in OCI is recycled to profit or loss.
iii. Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI (equity instruments) 
Upon initial recognition, the Bank can elect to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments 
designated at fair value through OCI when they meet the definition of equity under IAS 32 Financial Instruments:
Presentation and are not held for trading. The classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. 
Gains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss. 
Dividends are recognized as other income in profit or loss when the right of payment has been established, except 
when the Bank benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such 
gains are recorded in OCI.
Equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment assessment.
The Bank elected to classify irrevocably its non-listed equity investments under this category as it intends to hold 
these investments for the foreseeable future.
iv. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading, financial assets 
designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, or financial assets mandatorily required to 
be measured at fair value. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose 
of selling or repurchasing in the near term.
ANNUAL REPORT 2022/23
53
BANK OF ABYSSINIA 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023
Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified as held for trading unless they are 
designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of 
principal and interest are classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of the business 
model.
Notwith standing the criteria for debt instruments to be classified at amortised cost or at fair value through OCI, 
as described above, debt instruments may be designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition 
if doing so eliminates, or significantly reduces, an accounting mismatch.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value 
with net changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.
2.4.1.3. Impairment of financial assets
Overview of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) principles 
The Bank recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses “ECL” for financial assets that are debt instruments 
and are not measured at FVTPL. 
The Bank measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL except for the following for which they are 
measured as 12-month ECL:
• 
Fixed income securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date;
• 
And other financial instruments for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition.
2.4.2. 
Financial liabilities 
2.4.2.1. Initial recognition and measurement 
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans 
and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. 
All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net 
of directly attributable transaction costs. 
2.4.2.2. Subsequent measurement 
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: 
i. 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss  
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial 
liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. 
Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near 
term. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in profit or loss. Financial liabilities designated 
upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated at the initial date of recognition, and 
only if the criteria in IFRS 9 are satisfied. The Bank has not designated any financial liability as at fair value 
through profit or loss. 
54 ANNUAL REPORT 2022/23
BANK OF ABYSSINIA 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023
ii. 
Loans and Borrowings  
This is the category most relevant to the Bank. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or 
loss when the liabilities are de-recognized as well as through the EIR amortization process. 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that 
are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included as finance costs in profit or loss. 
2.4.3. 
Impairment 
i. 
Restructured financial Assets
Where the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial assets is replaced with a 
new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then the Bank shall assess whether the financial asset should 
be derecognized and ECL are measured as follows:
• 
If the expected restructuring will not result in de-recognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash 
flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing 
asset.
• 
If the expected restructuring will result in de-recognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of 
the new asset is related as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its de-recognition. 
This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted 
from the expected date of de-recognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the 
existing financial asset.
ii. 
Credit-impaired financial assets
At each reporting date, the Bank shall assess whether financial assets carried at amortized cost, debt financial assets 
carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit-impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’).
A financial asset shall be considered ‘credit-impaired” when one or more events that have a detrimental impact 
on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.
Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:
• 
Significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
• 
A breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
• 
The restructuring of a loan or advance by the Bank of terms that the Bank would not consider otherwise;
• 
It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization; or
• 
The disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.
A loan that has been renegotiated due to deterioration in the borrower’s condition shall be considered to be credit- 
impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly 
and there are no other indicators of impairment.
In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more shall be considered credit-impaired even when the 
regulatory definition of default is different.

BANK OF ABYSSINIA 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023
iii. Presentation of allowance for ECL in the statement of financial position
Loss allowance for ECL shall be presented in the statement of financial position as follows:
• 
For financial assets measured at amortized cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets;
• 
For loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts: generally, as a provision;
• 
Where a financial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Bank cannot 
identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from those on the drawn component: the 
Bank presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The combined amount is presented as a 
deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component.  Any excess of the loss allowance over 
the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision; and
• 
For debt instruments measured at FVOCI: no loss allowance is recognized in the statement of financial 
position because the carrying amount of those assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance shall 
be disclosed and is recognized in the fair value reserve
iv. Write-off 
Loans and debt securities shall be written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation 
of recovering the amount in its entirety or a portion there of. This is generally the case when the Bank determines 
that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay 
the amounts subject to the write-off.  This assessment shall be carried out at the individual asset level.
Recoveries of amounts previously written off shall be included in ‘impairment losses on financial instruments’ in 
the statement of profit or loss and OCI.
Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Bank’s 
procedures for recovery of amounts due.
v. 
Non-integral financial guarantee contracts 
The Banks shall assess whether a financial guarantee contact held is an integral element of a financial asset that 
is accounted for as a component of that instrument or is a contract that is accounted for, separately.
Where the Bank determines that the guarantee is an integral element of the financial asset, then any premium 
payable in connection with the initial recognition of the financial asset shall be treated as a transaction cost of 
acquiring it. 
The Bank shall consider the effect of the protection when measuring the fair value of the debit instrument and 
when measuring ECL. 
Where the Bank determines that the guarantee is not an integral element of the debt instrument, then it shall 
recognize an asset representing any prepayment of guarantee premium and a right to compensation for credit 
losses.

Modifications of financial assets and financial liabilities
i. 
Financial Assets
If the terms of a financial asset are modified, then the Bank shall evaluate whether the cash flows of the modified 
asset are substantially different. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash 
flows from the original financial asset shall be deemed to have expired. 
In this case, the original financial asset shall be derecognized and a new financial asset shall be recognized at fair 
value plus any eligible transaction costs.
Any fees received as part of the modification shall be accounted for as follows:
• 
Fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement 
of eligible transaction costs shall be included in the initial measurement of the asset; and
• 
Other fees are included in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on de-recognition.
If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification 
is usually to maximize recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with 
substantially different terms.
If the Bank plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it shall 
first consider whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place.
Where the modification of a financial asset measured at amortized cost or FVOCI does not result in de-recognition 
of the financial asset, then the Bank shall first recalculate the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using 
the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognizes the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or 
loss in profit or loss.  Any costs or fees incurred and fees received as part of the modification adjust the gross 
carrying amount of the modified financial asset and shall be amortized over the remaining term of the modified 
financial asset.
Where such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of borrower, then the gain or loss shall be 
presented together with impairment losses.
In other cases, it shall be presented as interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method.
ii. 
Financial Liabilities
The Bank shall derecognize a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified 
liability are substantially different.  In this case, a new financial liability. based on the modified terms shall be 
recognized at fair value.  The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and 
consideration paid is recognized in profit or loss.
Consideration paid shall include non-financial assets transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including 
the new modified financial liability
Where the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as de-recognition, then the amortized cost of the 
liability shall be recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate and the 
resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss.  Any costs and fees incurred are recognized as an adjustment 
to the carrying amount of the liability and amortized over the remaining term of the modified financial liability by 
re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument.

Offsetting
Financial assets and financial liabilities shall be offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial 
position when, and only when, the Bank currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends 
either to settle them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Income and expenses shall be presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS, or for gains and losses 
arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Bank’s trading activity.
2.4.7. 
Designation at fair value throughprofit or loss 
i. 
Financial Assets
At initial recognition, the Bank may designate certain financial assets as at FVTPL because this designation 
eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch, which would otherwise arise. 
ii. 
Financial Liabilities
The Bank shall designate certain financial liabilities as at FVTPL in either of the following circumstances:
• 
The liabilities are managed, evaluated and reported internally on a fair value basis; or
• 
The designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.
2.5. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include notes and coins on hand, unrestricted and restricted reserve requirement 
balances held with NBE and highly liquid financial assets with original maturities of three months or less from the 
date of acquisition that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, and are used by the Bank 
in the management of its short-term commitments.  Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost in the 
statement of financial position.
2.6. 
Property, plant and equipment
i. 
Initial recognition 
The amount capitalized at initial recognition is the purchase price of the asset along with any further costs 
incurred in bringing the asset to its present condition and location.
ii. 
Subsequent valuation 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount of recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, 
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the 
cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net 
of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment if the recognition criteria are met.
When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Bank 
recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly.  All other 
repair and maintenance costs are recognized in income statement as incurred.

The Bank commences depreciation when the asset is available for use.  Land is not depreciated.
Capital work-in-progress is not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use.  They are disclosed when 
reclassified during the year.
iv. Gain or losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognized is derecognized upon 
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use disposal.
Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in income statement when the asset is derecognized. 
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at 
each financial year end and adjusted prospectively.
2.7. 
Intangible assets 
i. 
Initial recognition 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.  Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, 
if any.  Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalized development costs, are not capitalized and the 
related expenditure is reflected in income statement in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.
ii. 
Amortization
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.  Intangible assets with 
finite lives are amortized over the useful economic life.  The amortization period and the amortization 
method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. 
 
Changes in the expected useful life, or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits 
embodied in the asset, are accounted for by changing the amortization period or methodology, as appropriate, 
ANNUAL REPORT 2022/23
59
BANK OF ABYSSINIA 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023
which are then treated as changes in accounting estimates.  The amortization expenses on intangible assets with 
finite lives is presented as separate line item in the income statement. 
Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method to write down the cost of intangible assets to their 
residual values over their estimated useful lives. Except for undisclosed useful life in the contract the Bank has 
used 6 years’ useful life for all intangible assets the rest will use as per contract, the residual rate will be zero 
percent for all intangible asset. 
2.8. 
Investment property
Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, are classified as investment 
properties.
Recognition of investment properties takes place only when it is probable that the future economic benefits that are 
associated with the investment property will flow to the Bank and the cost can be reliably measured. This is usually 
when all risks are transferred.
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs.  The Bank has opted to subsequently 
carry investment property at cost and disclose fair value.  Fair value is based on comparative market prices, adjusted 
if necessary, for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific asset.  If this information is not 
available, the Bank uses alternative valuation methods, such as recent prices on less active markets or discounted 
cash flow projections.  Valuations are performed as of the reporting date by professional values who hold recognized 
and relevant professional qualifications and have recent experience in location and category of the investment 
property being valued.  These valuations from the basis for the carrying amounts in the financial statements.  
The fair value of investment property reflects, the near current market conditions.  The fair value of investment 
property does not reflect future capital expenditure that will improve or enhance the property and does not reflect 
the related future benefits from this future expenditure other than those a rational market participant would take 
into account when determining the value of the property.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized to the asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.  All 
other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred.  When part of an investment property is replaced, 
the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized.
Investment properties are derecognized when they have been disposed.  Where the Bank disposes of a property at 
fair value in an arm’s length transaction, the carrying value immediately prior to the sale is adjusted to the transaction 
price, and the adjustment is recorded in the statement of changes in net assets available for benefit.
2.9. 
Lease
At an inception of a contract, the Bank assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, 
a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for 
consideration.  To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified assets, the Bank 
uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.
This policy is applied to contracts entered into before, on or after 1 July 2019 that were previously identified as leases.

BANK OF ABYSSINIA 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023
Bank Acting as a Lessee
At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Bank allocates consideration in 
the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone price.  However, for leases of branches and 
office premises the Bank has elected to separate non-lease components from the space rental payment obligations.
The Bank recognizes a right-of-use of asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date,
The right-of-use of asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for 
any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of 
costs to dismantle and remove any improvements made to branches or office premises
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the 
end of the lease term.  In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted 
for certain re-measurement of the lease liability. 
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement 
date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the bank’s 
incremental borrowing rate.  Generally, the Bank uses its incremental borrowing rate at the discount rate.
The Bank determines its incremental borrowing rate by analyzing its borrowings from various external sources and 
makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of asset leased.
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:
• 
Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;
• 
Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as the 
commencement date;
• 
Amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and
• 
The exercise price under a purchase option that the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise lease payments in 
an optional renewal period if the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for 
early termination of a lease unless the Bank is reasonably certain not to terminate early.
The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is re-measured when there is a 
change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Bank’s estimate of 
the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Bank changes its assessment of whether 
it will exercise a purchase extension or termination option if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.
When the lease liability is re-measured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the 
right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
The Bank presents right-of-use assets in property and equipment and lease liabilities in other liabilities in the 
statement of financial position. 
Short-term Leases and Leases of Low-value Assets
The Bank has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for lease of low value assets and short-
term leases, including ATM rent payments. The Bank recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as 
an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term.

Bank Acting as a Lessor
At inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Bank allocates the consideration 
in the contract to each lease component on the bases of their relative stand-alone selling prices.
When the Bank acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether the lease is a finance lease or an operating 
lease.
To classify each lease, the Bank makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks 
and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset, if this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not; then 
it is an operating lease as part of this assessment, the Bank considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for 
the major part of the economic life of the asset.
The Bank applies the de-recognition and impairment requirement in IFRS 9 to the net investment in the lease.  The Bank 
further regularly reviews estimated unguaranteed residual values used in calculating the gross investment in the lease.
2.10. 
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and discontinued operations
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered 
principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and as safe is considered highly probable. 
 
They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as 
deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, financial assets and investment property that are carried 
at fair value and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which are specifically exempted from this requirement.
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale and measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value 
less cost to sell when:
a. 
Their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through sale;
b.  They are available for immediate sale in their present condition;
c. 
Their sale is highly probable.
An impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair 
value less costs to sell.  A gain is recognized for any subsequent increases in fair value less cost to sell of an asset 
(or disposal group). But not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognized.  A gain or loss not 
previously recognized by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognized at the date 
of de-recognition.
Non-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortized while they 
are classified as held for sale.  Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified 
as held for sale continue to be recognized.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are 
presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet.   The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held 
for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the balance sheet.
A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and 
that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single coordinated 
plant to dispose of such a line of business of area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view of 
resale.  The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the statement of profit or loss.

2.11. 
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Bank assesses, each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.  If any indication 
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required.  The Bank estimates the asset’s recoverable 
amount.  An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or Cash-Generating Units (CGU) fair value less 
costs of disposal and its value in use.  Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does 
not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. 
 When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and 
is written down to its recoverable amount.  In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to 
their present value using pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risk specific to the asset.  In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken 
into account.  If no such transactions can be identified, and appropriate valuation model is used.  These calculations 
are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair 
value indicators.
The Bank bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared 
separately for each of the Bank’s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated.  These budgets and forecast 
calculations generally cover a period of five years.  For longer periods, a long term growth rate is calculated and 
applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.  For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each 
reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognized impairment losses no longer 
exist or have decreased.  If such indication exists, the Bank estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. 
A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to 
determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized.  The reversal is limited 
so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior 
years.  Such reversal is recognized in the income statement.
2.12. 
Other assets
Other assets are generally defined as claims held against other entities for the future receipt of money. The assets in 
the Bank’s financial statements include the following:
a. 
Prepayment 
Prepayments are payment made in advance for services to be enjoyed in future.  The amount is initially capitalized 
in the reporting period in which the payment is made and subsequently amortized over the period in which the 
service is to be enjoyed.
b. Other receivables
Other receivables are recognized upon the occurrence of event or transaction as they arise and cancelled when 
payment is received.  The Bank’s other receivables are rent receivables and other receivables from debtors.
2.13. 
 Inventories
Held in the form of materials or supplies to be consumed in the Bank’s operations or in rendering of services. 
For BoA, inventories would normally comprise materials and supplies not directly expended at the time of their 
purchase, such as stationery and printing materials, uniform, CPO, passbook, office and other general supplies. 
ANNUAL REPORT 2022/23

BANK OF ABYSSINIA 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023
The cost of inventories of items that are ordinarily interchangeable and have not been produced and segregated for 
specific projects is determined by using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or weighted average cost formula. The Bank uses 
FIFO method for measuring its inventories. The cost of inventory is recognized as an expense when the inventory is 
used.
2.14. 
Fair value measurement
The Bank measures financial instruments classified as (FVTPL) and (FVOCI) at fair value at each statement of 
financial position date.  Fair value related disclosures for financial instruments and non-financial assets that are 
measured at fair value or where fair values are disclosed are, summarized in the following notes:
• 
Disclosures for valuation methods, significant estimates and assumptions Notes 3 and Note 4.7.1.
• 
Quantitative disclosures of fair value measurement hierarchy Notes 4.7.2.
• 
Financial instruments (including those carried at amortized cost) Notes 4.7.2.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
• 
In principal market for the asset or liability, or
• 
In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Bank.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when 
pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
The Bank uses valuation technique that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available 
to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized 
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
• 
Level 1 – Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• 
Level 2 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
is directly or indirectly observable.
• 
Level 3 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
is observable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the financial statements on a recurring basis.  The Bank determines 
whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole); at the end of each reporting period.
The Bank’s management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement, such as 
available-for-sale financial assets.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Bank has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the 
nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.

Employee benefits
The Bank operates various post-employment schemes, including both defined benefit and defined contribution 
pension plans and post-employment benefits.
a. 
Defined contribution plan
The Bank operates two defined contribution plans;
i. 
Pension scheme in line with the provisions of Ethiopian Pension of private organization employee’s proclamation 
715/2011. Funding under the scheme is 7% and 11% by employees and the Bank, respectively;
ii. 
Provident fund contribution, funding under this scheme is 6% and 12% by employees and the Bank, respectively; 
based on the employees’ salary.  Employer’s contribution to this scheme are charged to profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income in the period in which they relate.
b. Defined benefit plan
The liability or asset recognized in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.  The 
defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The liability recognized in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans if the 
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. 
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit 
method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash 
outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which 
the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension 
obligation.
The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognized in the income statement in employee benefit expense, 
except where included in the cost of an asset, reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from 
employee service in the current year, benefit changes curtailments and settlements.
Past-service costs are recognized immediately income.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged 
or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
c. 
Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable to Bank employees and executive directors when employment is terminated 
by the Bank before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in 
exchange for these benefits.  The Bank recognizes termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to 
either: terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility 
of withdrawal; or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.

d. Profit-sharing and bonus plans
The Bank recognizes a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing based on a formula that takes 
into consideration the profit attributable to the company’s shareholders after certain adjustments.  The 
Bank recognizes a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a 
construction obligation.
2.16. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, 
it’s probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  When the Bank expects some or all of a provision 
to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset, 
but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.  The expense relating to a provision is presented in income 
statement net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current  pre-tax rate that 
reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.  When discounting is used, the increase in the provision 
due to the passage of time is recognized as other operating expenses.
2.17. 
Share capita
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options or to the acquisition of a business are 
shown in equality as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
2.18. 
 Earnings per share
The Bank presents basic earnings per share for its ordinary shares.  Basic earnings per share are calculated by 
dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholder of the Bank by weighted average number of shares 
outstanding during the period.
2.19. 
Income taxation
a. 
Current Income tax
The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based 
on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the 
end of the reporting period in Ethiopia.  Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with 
respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.  It establishes provisions 
where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. 
b. Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the financial statements.  However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if they 
arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit nor loss.
66 ANNUAL REPORT 2022/23
BANK OF ABYSSINIA 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realized or the deferred tax 
liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available 
against which the temporary differences can be utilized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the 
same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention 
to settle the balances on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when they arise in the same tax reporting group and where 
there is both the legal right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously.
2.20. Interest Free Banking (IFB)
2.20.1. Murabaha
Murabaha is an Islamic financial transaction which represents an agreement whereby the Bank buys a commodity/good 
and sells it to a counterparty (customer) based on a promise received from that counterparty to buy the commodity 
according to specific terms and conditions. The selling price comprises of the cost of the commodity/good and a pre-
agreed profit margin.
It is treated as financial receivables.  Financial receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market.
The profit is quantifiable and contractually determined at the commencement of the contract.  Murabaha income 
(profit) is recognized as it accrues over the life of the contract using the effective profit method (EPRM) on the 
principal balance outstanding. These products are carried at amortized cost less impairment.
2.21. 
 Recognition of income and expenses
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Bank and the 
revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made.  Revenue is measured at the fair 
value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and 
excluding taxes or duty.
The Bank earns income from interest on loans given for domestic trade and services, building and construction, 
manufacturing, agriculture and personal loans.  Other incomes includes margins on letter of credits and performance 
guarantees.
2.21.1. Interest and similar income and expense
For all the government bills measured at amortized cost and interest bearing financial assets classified as available 
–for-sale interest income or expense is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR), which is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or a 
shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.

BANK OF ABYSSINIA 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023
The calculation takes into account all contractual terms of the financial instruments (for example, prepayment 
options) and includes any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and are an integral 
part of the effective interest rate (EIR), but not future credit losses.
The carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability is adjusted if the Bank revises its estimates of payments 
or receipts. The adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the original EIR and the change in carrying amount is 
recorded as ‘Interest and similar income’ for financial assets and interest and similar expenses for financial liabilities. 
 
Once the recorded value of a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been reduced due to an 
impairment loss, interest income continues to be recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the future 
cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
2.21.2. Net trading income
Net trading income comprises gains less losses related to trading assets and liabilities, and includes all fair value 
changes, interest, dividends and foreign exchange differences.
2.21.3. Net interest income
a. 
Effective interest rate and amortized cost 
Interest income and expense are recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest method.  The effective 
interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected 
life of the financial instrument to:
• 
The gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or
• 
The amortized cost of the financial liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments other than credit impaired assets, the 
Bank estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not expected 
credit losses.  For credit-impaired financial assets, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate is calculated using 
estimated future cash flows including expected credit losses.
The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees and payments paid or received 
that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.  Transaction costs include incremental costs that are 
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability
b. Amortized cost and gross carrying amount
The ‘amortized cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or 
financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative 
amortization using the effective interest method or any difference between that initial amount and the maturity 
amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance (or impairment, allowance 
before 1 July, 2018).
The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortized cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any 
expected credit loss allowance.
c. 
Calculation of interest income and expens
In calculating interest income and expense the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of 
the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortized cost of the liability.
68 ANNUAL REPORT 2022/23
BANK OF ABYSSINIA 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023
However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is 
calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the financial asset.  If the asset is no longer 
credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts the gross basis.
For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the 
credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the asset.  The calculation of interest income does 
not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves.
d. Presentation
Interest income and expense presented in the statement of profit or loss and OCI include:
• 
Interest on financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortized cost calculated on an effective interest basis;
• 
Interest on debt instruments measured at FVOCI calculated on an effective interest basis;
• 
The effective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivatives designated in cash flow hedges of 
variability in interest cash flows, in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect interest income/expense; 
And
• 
The effective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivative designated in fair value hedges of 
interest rate risk.
Interest income and expense on all trading assets and liabilities are considered to be incidental to the Bank’s 
trading operations and are presented together with all other changes in the fair value of trading assets and 
liabilities in net trading income.
Interest income and expense on other financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL are presented in net 
income from other financial instruments at FVTPL.
2.21.4. Fees and commission
Fees and commission income and expenses that are integral to the effective interest rate on a financial asset-
government bills or liability are included in the measurement of the effective interest rate.  Other fees and commission 
income; money transfer, letter of credit, payment orders, un cleared effects, ATM and POS transactions etc. are 
recognized as the related services are performed.
When a loan commitment is not expected to result in the draw-down of a loan, loan commitment fees are recognized 
on a straight-line basis over the commitment period.
Other fees and commission expense relates mainly to transaction and service fees are expensed as the services are received.
2.21.5. Dividend income
This is recognized when the Bank’s right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when the 
shareholders approve and declare the dividend.
2.21.6. Foreign exchange revaluation gains or losses
These are gains and losses, arising on settlement and translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies of the functional currency’s; spot rate of exchange at the reporting date.  This amount is recognized 
in the income statement and it is further broken down into realized and unrealized portion.
The monetary assets and liabilities include financial assets wit in the foreign currency deposits received and held on 
behalf of third parties etc.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTION
The preparation of the Bank’s financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liability, and the accompanying 
disclosures, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates 
could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected 
in future period.
Other disclosures relating to the Bank’s exposure to risks and uncertainties includes:
• 
Capital management 
• 
Financial risk management and policies 
3.1. Judgments
In the process of applying the Bank’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgments, which 
have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements.
3.2. 
 Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation at the reporting date that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year, are described below. The Bank based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the 
financial statements were prepared. 
Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes 
or circumstances beyond the control of the Bank. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
3.3. 
Defined benefit plans
The cost of the defined benefit pension plan, long service awards, gratuity scheme and post-employment medical 
benefits and the present value of these defined benefit obligations are determined using actuarial valuations. An 
actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. 
These include the pension increases. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a 
defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each 
reporting date.
3.4. 
Deprecation and carrying value of property, plant and equipment 
The estimate of the useful lives of assets is based on Management’s judgment.  Any material adjustment to the estimated 
useful lives of items of property and equipment will have an impact on the carrying value of these items
3.5. 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which 
is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.  The fair value less costs of disposal calculation 
is based on available data from binding sales transactions, conducted at arm’s length, for similar assets or observable 
market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset.  The value in use calculation is based on a DCF model. 
The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the 
Bank is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the asset’s performance of the CGU 
being tested.  The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as 
well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purpose.

BANK OF ABYSSINIA 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023
3.6. 
Taxes
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount 
and timing of future taxable income.  Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term 
nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the 
assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and 
expense already recorded.  The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience of previous 
tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority.
Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses to the extent that this is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the losses can be utilized.  Significant management judgment is required to determine the 
amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable 
profits together with future tax planning strategies. 
3.7. 
Development cost 
The Bank capitalizes development costs for a project in accordance with the accounting policy. Initial capitalization of 
costs is based on Management’s judgment that technological and economic feasibility is confirmed, usually when a 
product development project has reached a defined milestone according to established project management model. 
In determining the amounts to be capitalized, management makes assumptions regarding the expected future 
cash generation of the project, discount rates to be applied and the expected period of benefits.   
4. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
4.1. Introduction
Risk is the effect of uncertainty on objectives of an entity; an effect can be either positive or negative deviation from 
what is expected. Therefore, risk is the chance that there will be a positive or negative deviation from the objective 
that is expected to be achieved.
Risk management is a systematic approach to identify, analyse, evaluate, and treat risks that may have an adverse 
impact on targeted objectives of an entity; and it is also a process of understanding and managing risks that the entity 
is inevitably subjected to in due process of achieving its corporate objectives.  
 
4.1.1. 
Risk management structure
The Board of Directors shall generally be responsible for ensuring the appropriateness of the Banks risk management 
program and its proper implementation. The Board has already established Loan Review and Risk Management Sub-
Committee that facilitates Board function.
In view of the strategic direction and risk appetite by the Board, the senior Management shall be responsible for the 
implementation of risk management policies and procedures.
Business units/operational units are primarily responsible for ensuring the Banks compliance with regulatory 
requirement and internal policies and procedures.
Bank of Abyssinia considers Liquidity, Credit, Market, Operational, Legal, Strategic, Compliance, and Reputational risks 
as core risks of the Bank.
Treasury and Financial Accounting Department establishes management information system that promptly conveys 
information between the organs in the liquidity risk management structure.
ANNUAL REPORT 2022/23

BANK OF ABYSSINIA 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023
ALCO shall closely control asset and liability structure of the Bank for maximization of its earning without endangering 
its liquidity status and report the status periodically for the board of directors.
The Internal Audits/Auditors shall ensure reliability, accuracy and timeless of financial, operational and regulatory 
reports.  
 
4.1.2. 
Risk measurement and reporting systems 
The Bank’s risks are measured using a method that reflect both the expected loss likely to arise in normal circumstances 
and unexpected losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss based on scenario analysis. The analysis 
makes used probabilities derived from historical experience, adjusted to reflect the economic environment. The 
Bank also runs worst-case scenarios that would arise in the event that extreme events which are unlikely to occur do, 
in fact occur.
Monitoring and reviewing of risk management practice should be planned part of the risk management process 
and involve regular checking to ensure that adequate and important Information is generated by the risk 
management process. Furthermore, the informationShall be captured, used and maintained effectively. This 
ensures that risk management is Effective, and provides evidence of a demonstrable risk management system. 
Thus, it’s important to have a documented formal record of the risk management process outcomes,Risk review 
report will be generated periodically, which is outcome of monitoring and review ofrisk management practice of the 
Bank. The report will propose plausible solution for identified loopholes besides describing the current status of risk 
management practice. The targeted audience are Board of Directors and executive management.
4.1.3. 
Risk mitigation  
 
 
 
Risk controls and mitigates, identified and approved for the Bank, are documented for existing and new processes 
and systems.
The adequacy of this mitigates is tested on a periodic basis through administration of control self- assessment 
questionnaires, using an operational risk management tool which requires risk owners to confirm the effectiveness 
of established controls. These are subsequently audited as part of the review process. 
4.2. 
Financial instruments by category   
The Bank’s financial assets are classified in to the following measurement categories: measured at amortized cost 
and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). 
Financial instruments are classified in the statement of financial position in accordance with their legal form and 
substance.

Credit risk 
 
 
 
 
Credit risk is the risk that the Bank borrowers are either unwilling to discharge their obligation or their ability to discharge 
such obligation is impaired resulting in economic loss to the Bank. CreditRisk also arise from off-balance commitment’s 
(such as guarantees &letter of credits) and placement With other banks (both domestic and foreign banks)
The Bank shall strive to ensure the existence of fundamental credit risk management elements that enable to effectively 
manage the credit risk exposure. 
Sound and prudent risk management involves the minimization of concentration risk by diversifying Credit 
portfolio;therefore,the Bank shall have credit diversification policies state clearly the goals for Portfoliomix and 
place exposure limits on single counterparties and groups of associated counterparties,key industries or economic 
sectors,geographical regions and new and existing products, Collateral type, NPLs and off-balance sheet exposure. 
Moreover, the Bank shall strictly observe the directives, rules and regulations of the NBE in this respect.
The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) sets credit risk limit for a single borrower, one related party and all related parties 
to not exceed 25%, 15% and 35% of Bank’s total capital amount as of the reporting quarterly period respectively.
Credit management is conducted as per the risk management policy and guideline approved by the board of directors 
and the Risk Management Committees. Such policies are reviewed and modified periodically based on changes and 
expectations of the markets where the Bank operates, regulations, and other factors.

i. 
Loans and advances to corporate customers 
The general creditworthiness of a corporate customer tends to be the most relevant indicator of credit quality 
of a loan extended to it. However, collateral provides additional security and the Bank generally requests that 
corporate borrowers provide it. The Bank may take collateral in the form of a first charge over real estate, floating 
charges over all corporate assets and other liens and guarantees. 
 
Because of the Bank’s focus on corporate customers’ creditworthiness, the Bank does not routinely update the 
valuation of collateral held against all loans to corporate customers. Valuation of collateral is updated when the 
loan is put on a watch list and the loan is monitored more closely. For credit-impaired loans, the Bank obtains 
appraisals of collateral because it provides input into determining the management credit risk actions.

ii. 
Significant increase in credit risk 
 
 
When determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial 
recognition, the Bank considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without 
undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the 
Bank’s historical experience and expert credit assessment and including forward-looking information.
The objective of the assessment is to identify whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred for an 
exposure by comparing: 
 
 
 
• 
The remaining lifetime probability of default (PD) as at the reporting date; with
• 
The remaining lifetime PD for this point in time that was estimated at the time of initial recognition of the 
exposure (adjusted where relevant for changes in prepayment expectations). 
• 
The Bank uses three criteria for determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk:
 
»
 
Quantitative test based on movement in PD; 
 
»
Qualitative indicators; and
 
»
A backstop of 30 days past due, 
 
iii. Credit risk grades 
 
 
 
 
The Bank allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on a variety of data that is determined to be 
predictive of the risk of default and applying experienced credit judgement. Credit risk grades are defined using 
qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of risk of default. These factors vary depending on the 
nature of the exposure and the type of borrower. 
 
 
 
Credit risk grades are defined and calibrated such that the risk of default occurring increases exponentially as 
the credit risk deteriorates so, for example, the difference in risk of default between credit risk grades 1 and 
2 is smaller than the difference between credit risk grades 2 and 3.Each exposure is allocated to a credit risk 
grade on initial recognition based on available information about the borrower. Exposures are subject to ongoing 
monitoring, which may result in an exposure being moved to a different credit risk grade. The monitoring typically 
involves use of the following data; 
 
 
 
a. 
Term loan exposures
Information obtained during periodic review of customer files – e.g. audited financial statements, management 
accounts, budgets and projections. Examples of areas of particular focus are: gross profit margins, financial 
leverage ratios, debt service coverage, compliance
• 
Data from credit reference agencies, press articles, changes in external credit ratings 
• 
Actual and expected significant changes in the political, regulatory and technological environment of the 
borrower or in its business activities

• 
 Internally collected data on customer behaviour – e.g. utilisation of credit card facilities 
 
• 
Affordability metrics 
 
 
 
b. Overdraft exposures 
• 
Payment record – this includes overdue status as well as a range of variables about payment ratios 
• 
Utilisation of the granted limit 
• 
Requests for and granting of forbearance 
• 
Existing and forecast changes in business, financial and economic conditions.
iv. Generating the term structure of PD  
Credit risk grades are a primary input into the determination of the term structure of PD for exposures. The Bank 
collects performance and default information about its credit risk exposures analysed by type of product and 
borrower as well as by credit risk grading. The Bank employs statistical models to analyse the data collected and 
generate estimates of the remaining lifetime PD of exposures and how these are expected to change as a result 
of the passage of time. 
 
 
 
v. 
Determining whether credit risk has increased significantly 
 
 
 
 
The Bank assesses whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition at each reporting 
date. Determining whether an increase in credit risk is significant depends on the characteristics of the financial 
instrument and the borrower. What isconsidered significant differs for different types of lending. 
The credit risk may also be deemed to have increased significantly since initial recognition based on qualitative 
factors linked to the Bank’s credit risk management processes that may not otherwise be fully reflected in its 
quantitative analysis on a timely basis. This will be the case for exposures that meet certain heightened risk 
criteria, such as placement on a watch list. Such qualitative factors are based on its expert judgment and relevant 
historical experiences. 
 
 
 
 
As a backstop, the Bank considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when an asset is 
more than 30 days past due. Days past due are determined by counting the number of days since the earliest 
elapsed due date in respect of which full payment has not been received. Due dates are determined without 
considering any grace period that might be available to the borrower.  
If there is evidence that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk relative to initial recognition, then 
the loss allowance on an instrument returns to being measured as 12-month ECL. Some qualitative indicators of 
an increase in credit risk, such as delinquency or forbearance, may be indicative of an increased risk of default 
that persists after the indicator itself has ceased to exist. In these cases, the Bank determines a probation period 
during which the financial asset is required to demonstrate good behaviour to provide evidence that its credit 
risk has declined sufficiently. When contractual terms of a loan have been modified, evidence that the criteria for 
recognising lifetime ECL are no longer met includes a history of up-to-date payment performance against the 
modified contractual terms.

BANK OF ABYSSINIA 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023
The Bank monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify significant increases in credit risk by regular 
reviews to confirm that: 
 
 
• 
The criteria are capable of identifying significant increases in credit risk before an exposure is in default;
• 
The criteria do not align with the point in time when an asset becomes 30 days past due; 
• 
The average time between the identification of a significant increase in credit risk and default appears 
reasonable;
• 
Exposures are not generally transferred directly from 12-month ECL measurement to credit- impaired; and
• 
There is no unwarranted volatility in loss allowance from transfers between 12-month PD (Stage 1) and lifetime 
PD (Stage 2). 
 
 
 
vi. Definition of default  
 
 
 
The Bank considers a financial asset to be in default when: 
• 
The borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank in full, without recourse by the Bank to 
actions such as realising security (if any is held); 
• 
The borrower is more than 90 days past due on any material credit obligation to the Bank.
• 
Overdrafts are considered as being past due once the customer has breached an advised limit or been advised 
of a limit smaller than the current amount outstanding; or  
 
• 
It is becoming probable that the borrower will restructure the asset as a result of bankruptcy due to the 
borrower’s inability to pay its credit obligations.
      In assessing whether a borrower is in default, the Bank considers indicators that are: 
 
• 
Qualitative: e.g. breaches of covenant; 
• 
Quantitative: e.g. overdue status and non-payment on another obligation of the same issuer to the Bank; 
and 
• 
based on data developed internally and obtained from external sources. 
 
 
• 
Inputs into the assessment of whether a financial instrument is in default and their significance may vary over 
time to reflect changes in circumstances. 
The definition of default largely aligns with that applied by the Bank for regulatory capital purposes  
vii. Incorporation of forward-looking information 
 
The Bank incorporates forward-looking information into both the assessment of whether the credit risk of an 
instrument has increased significantly since its initial recognition and the measurement of ECL. 
For each segment, the Bank formulates three economic scenarios: a base case, which is the median scenario, 
and two less likely scenarios, one upside and one downside. For each sector, the base case is aligned with the 
macroeconomic model’s information value output, a measure of the predictive power of the model, as well as 
base macroeconomic projections for identified macroeconomic variables for each sector.
The upside and downside scenarios are based on a combination of a percentage error factor of each sector model 
as well as simulated optimistic and pessimistic macroeconomic projections based on a measure of historical

macroeconomic volatilities 
External information considered includes economic data and forecasts published by Fitch Solutions formerly 
known as Business Monitor International, an external and independent market intelligence and research 
institution. This is in addition to industry –level, semi – annual NPL trends across statistically comparable sectors.
Periodically, the Bank carries out stress testing of more extreme shocks to calibrate its determination of the 
upside and downside representative scenarios.
A comprehensive review is performed at least annually on the design of the scenarios by a panel of experts that 
advises the Bank’s senior management. The Bank has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and 
credit losses for each portfolio of financial instruments and, using an analysis of historical data, has estimated 
relationships between macroeconomic variables and credit risk and credit losses 
 
 
The key drivers for credit risk for each of the Bank’s economic sectors is summarized below:

viii. Modified financial assets 
 
 
 
The contractual terms of a loan may be modified for a number of reasons, including changing market conditions, 
customer retention and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of the customer. 
An existing loan whose terms have been modified may be derecognised and the renegotiated loan recognised as 
a new loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy set out. 
When the terms of a financial asset are modified and the modification does not result in derecognition, the 
determination of whether the asset’s credit risk has increased significantly reflects comparison of: its remaining 
lifetime PD at the reporting date based on the modified terms; withthe remaining lifetime PD estimated based on 
data on initial recognition and the original contractual terms.  
 
When modification results in derecognition, a new loan is recognised and allocated to Stage 1 (assuming it is not 
credit-impaired at that time).  
The Bank renegotiates loans to customers in financial difficulties (referred to as ‘forbearance activities’) to 
maximise collection opportunities and minimise the risk of default. Under the Bank’s forbearance policy, loan 
forbearance is granted on a selective basis if the debtor is currently in default on its debt or if there is a high risk of 
default, there is evidence that the debtor made all reasonable efforts to pay under the original contractual terms 
and the debtor is expected to be able to meet the revised terms. 
 
 
The revised terms usually include extending the maturity, changing the timing of interest payments and amending 
the terms of loan covenants. Both retail and corporate loans are subject to the forbearance policy. The Bank 
Credit Committee regularly reviews reports on forbearance activities.  
For financial assets modified as part of the Bank’s forbearance policy, the estimate of PD reflects whether the 
modification has improved or restored the Bank’s ability to collect interest and principal and the Bank’s previous 
experience of similar forbearance action. As part of this process, the Bank evaluates the borrower’s payment 
performance against the modified contractual terms and considers various behavioural indicators. 
Generally, forbearance is a qualitative indicator of a significant increase in credit risk and an expectation of 
forbearance may constitute evidence that an exposure is credit-impaired. A customer needs to demonstrate 
consistently good payment behaviour over a period of time before the exposure is no longer considered to be 
credit-impaired/in default or the PD is considered to have decreased such that the loss allowance reverts to 
being measured at an amount equal to Stage 1.

BANK OF ABYSSINIA 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023
ix.  Measurement of ECL 
 
 
 
 
The key inputs into the measurement of ECL are the term structure of the following variables: 
• 
Probability of default (PD); 
 
• 
Loss given default (LGD); and 
 
 
• 
Exposure at default (EAD).
ECL for exposures in Stage 1 is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD by LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated by 
multiplying the lifetime PD by LGD and EAD. 
 
The methodology of estimating PDs is discussed above under the heading ‘Generating the term structure of PD’.
LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Bank estimates LGD parameters based on the history of 
recovery rates of claims against defaulted counterparties. The LGD models consider the structure, collateral, seniority of 
the claim, counterparty industry and recoverycosts of any collateral that is integral to the financial asset.  
 
EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Bank derives the EAD from the current 
exposure to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract and arising 
from amortisation. The EAD of a financial asset is its gross carrying amount at the time of default. For lending 
commitments, the EADs are potential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated 
based on historical observations and forward-looking forecasts. For financial guarantees, the EAD represents the 
amount of the guaranteed exposure when the financial guarantee becomes payable. For some financial assets, EAD 
is determined by modelling the range of possible exposure outcomes at various points in time using scenario and 
statistical techniques.
As described above, and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for Stage 1 financial assets, the Bank measures 
ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period (including any borrower’s extension options) 
over which it is exposed to credit risk, even if, for credit risk management purposes, the Bank considers a longer 
period.  
The maximum contractual period extends to the date at which the Bank has the right to require repayment of an 
advance or terminate a loan commitment or guarantee. 
However, for overdrafts that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment component, the Bank measures ECL 
over a period longer than the maximum contractual period if the Bank’s contractual ability to demand repayment 
and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the Bank’s exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice 
period. These facilities do not have a fixed term or repayment structure and are managed on a collective basis. The 
Bank can cancel them with immediate effect but this contractual right is not enforced in the normal day-to-day 
management, but only when the Bank becomes aware of an increasein credit risk at the facility level. This longer 
period is estimated taking into account the credit risk management actions that the Bank expects to take, and that 
serve to mitigate ECL. These include a reduction in limits, cancellation of the facility and/or turning the outstanding 
balance into a loan with fixed repayment terms.   
 
Where modelling of a parameter is carried out on a collective basis, the financial instruments are grouped on the 
basis of shared risk characteristics that include:

Risk limit  control and mitigation policies 
a. 
Collateral held and their financial effect 
The general creditworthiness of a customer tends to be the most relevant indicator of credit quality of a loan 
extended to it. However, collateral provides additional security and the Bank generally requests that corporate 
borrowers provide it. Staff loans are secured to the extent of the employee’s continued employment in the Bank. 
The Bank may take collateral in the form of a first charge over real estate, liens and guarantees.
The Bank does not sell or repledge the collateral in the absence of default by the owner of the collateral. In 
addition to the Bank’s focus on creditworthiness, the Bank aligns with its credit policy guide to periodically 
update the validation of collaterals held against all loans to customers.
86 ANNUAL REPORT 2022/23
BANK OF ABYSSINIA 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023
For impaired loans, the Bank obtains appraisals of collateral because the fair value of the collateral is an input to the 
impairment measurement.
The fair value of the collaterals are based on the last revaluations carried out by the Bank’s in-house engineers. The 
valuation technique adopted for properties is in line with the Bank’s  valuation manual and the revalued amount is 
similar to fair values of properties with similar size and location.
The fair value of collaterals other than properties such as share certificates, cash, NBE bills etc.  as disclosed at the 
carrying amount as management is of the opinion that the cost of the process of establishing the fair value of the 
collateral exceeds benefits accruable from the exercise.  
 
 
 
 
4.4. 
 Liquidity risk  
 
 
 
Liquidity Risk is the potential for loss to the Bank arising from either its inability to meet its obligations or to fund 
increase in assets as they fall due without incurring unacceptable cost or losses Liquidity risk may not be seen in 
isolation as it can be triggered by other financial risks such as credit risk, Market risk generally, liquidity risk results 
from size and maturity mismatch of Assets and liabilities.  
 
 
 
4.4.1. 
Management of liquidity risk  
 
Liquidity risk may not be seen in isolation as it can be triggered by other financial risks such as credit risk, market risk, 
etc. Generally, liquidity risk results from size and maturity mismatch of asset and liablities.
In order to keep optimal asset-liablity structure, thereby adhere to regulation in jurisdication; 
Boa Adopts liquidity risk management system that is goverened by adequate oversight, early warning system and 
proper implementation of risk management process.
The Bank shall form the ALCO committee whose members are drawn form its senior Management and entrust in which 
the responsibility of managing the overall liquidity of   the Bank. 
 
 
 
Cash flow forecasting is performed by the finance department. The finance department monitors rolling forecasts of 
liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs.  
 
The Bank has incurred indebtedness in the form of borrowings. The Bank evaluates its ability to meet its obligations on an 
ongoing basis. Based on these evaluations, the Bank devises strategies to manage its liquidity risk. 
Prudent liquidity risk management implies that sufficient cash is maintained and that sufficient funding is available 
to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or 
risk damage to the Bank’s reputation.  
 
 
 
4.4.2. Maturity analysis of financial liabilities 
The table below analyses the Bank’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining 
period at the statement of financial position date to the contractual maturity date. The cash flows presented are the 
undiscounted amounts to be settled in future.

Management of market risk  
 
Management of market risk is an area that has received increasing attention from mangers and supervisors of the 
globe as banks financial trading activites have been growing from time to time.
In Ethiopia,the market is not that much sensetive and involvement of banks are so limited to a few types of exposures.
The riske exposures considered as relevant are interest rate and exchange rate risks,
And hence,these are incorporated in this risk management programme.
i. 
Interest rate risk  
 
 
Interest rate risk is the potential impact on institutions earnings and on the net-asset values of the changes of its 
interest rates. IRR arises when an institutions principal and cash flows, both on and off the balance sheets have 
mismatched reprising dates.
Banks are exposed to IRR because they invariably operate with unmatched balance sheet i.e. being  Either IR sensitive 
asset or IR sensitive liabilities.

foreign currency holdings and liability of the Bank. Such change in value of currencies affects net open position 
in terms of local currency.
In general, foreign exchange rate risk is potential loss as a result of adverse movement in FOREX Rates.

 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
IFRS 13 requires an entity to classify measured or disclosed fair values according to a hierarchy that reflects the 
significance of observable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised 
within the fair value hierarchy, which comprises of three levels as described below: based on the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole. 
 
 
 
 
4.7.1. 
Valuation models
IFRS 13 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are 
observable or unobservable. Observable input reflect market data obtained from independent sources; unobservable 
inputs reflect the Bank’s market assumptions.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised 
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole.
• 
Level 1: Inputs that are quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• 
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) .This category includes 
instruments valued using: quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted

valuation technique in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data. 
 
In conclusion, this category is for valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant      to the 
fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
• 
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 
This category includes all assets and liabilities for which the valuation technique includes inputs not based on 
observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the asset or liability’s valuation. This 
category includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments for which significant 
unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments.

20b. Fair value measurement of the Bank’s Investment properties 
 
 
 
 
The Bank’s investment property is measured at cost. These properties include those held for rental purposes and 
those in which the Bank occupies an insignificant portion. These properties are held to earn rentals  and for capital 
appreciation. There are currently no restrictions on the realisability of these properties. 
Investment property is initially measured at cost including transaction costs and subsequently measured at 
depreciated cost (less any accumulated impairment losses). Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method 
to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives of 50 years. The fair value of investment 
properties  has been disclosed as required. 
 
 
 
 
Fair value measurement of the Bank’s Investment properties (Contd) 
 
 
 
The fair value of the Bank’s Investment property as at June 30,2023 and has been arrived at by in-house engineers 
qualified estate surveyors and reviewed and approved by independent valuers. These valuers have appropriate 
qualifications and recent experience in the valuation of properties in the relevant locations.  
The fair value was determined based on the replacement cost concept which approximates the estimated amount for 
which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm’s length 
transaction after proper marketing, prudently and without compulsion.  
 
This implies a market comparable approach that reflects the recent transaction prices for similar properties). In 
estimating the fair value of the properties, the highest and best use of the properties is their current use. There has 
been no change to the valuation technique during the year.  
 
 
 
 
 
20c. Fair value hierarchy

iii. Withdrawal from Service
The withdrawal rates are believed to be reasonably representative of the Ethiopian experience. The valuation 
assumed a rate of withdrawal of 14% at the youngest ages falling with increasing age to 2.9% at age 40. 
The sensitivity of the overall deﬁned beneﬁt liability to changes in the weighted principal assumption is:

The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. 
In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the 
sensitivity of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation to signiﬁcant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of 
the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) 
has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of ﬁnancial position.
There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior years. The 
average duration of the severance pay plan at the end of the reporting period is 2.78 years.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume

2022:nil), hence the basic and diluted loss per share have the same value.

The Regulatory risk reserve is a non-distributable reserves required by the regulations of the National Bank of 
Ethiopia(NBE) to be kept for impairment losses on loans and receivables in excess of IFRS charge as derived using 
the incurred loss model.
Where the loan loss impairment determined using the  National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) guidelines is higher than 
the loan loss impairment determined using the incurred loss model under IFRS, the difference is transferred to 
regulatory risk reserve and it is non-distributable to the owners of the Bank. 
Where the loan loss impairment determined using the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) guidelines is less than the loan 
loss impairment determined using the incurred loss model under IFRS, the difference is transferred from regulatory 
risk reserve to the retained earning to the extent of the non-distributable reserve previously recognised. 
Where the 52.5% of suspended interest income kept under this regulatory reserve account until the regulatory 
organs(NBE) amended the directive related with provision.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
36a.  Claims and litigation 
 
 
The Bank is a party to numerous legal actions brought by different organizations , individuals and the Ethiopian 
Ministry of Revenue, Customes Authority (ERCA) arising from its normal business operations. The maximum exposure 
of the Bank to these legal cases as at 30 June 2023 is Birr 127.21 million (30 June 2022: Birr 2.2 million). No provision 
has been made in the financial statements as the Directors believe that it is not probable that the economic benefits 
would flow out of the Bank in respect of these legal actions. 
 
 
36b 
Guarantees and letters of credit
The Bank conducts business involving performance bonds and guarantees. These instruments are given as 
a security to support the performance of a customer to third parties. As the Bank will only be required to 
meet these obligations in the event of the customer’s default, the cash requirements of these instruments are 
expected to be considerably below their nominal amounts.
The table below summarises the fair value amount of contingent liabilities for the account of customers:

37. EVENTS AFTER REPORTING PERIOD 
37.a. There were new directives issued by the central bank after the reporting date that could have a material 
effect on the Bank’s operations and profitability: 
• 
 All domestic loan growth by each individual bank should not exceed 14%, so that by the end of June 2024 
loans and advances growth amount is limited to 14%; 
• 
Direct credit to the government by the NBE shall not exceed 1/3 of the previous year loan; and that option 
should also be sought only after sourcing from treasury bill is exhausted, i.e. when Government bills are not 
available in the market; 
• 
Interest rate of NBE’s credit facility to local banks is raised from 16% to 18%; 
• 
To encourage exporters engaged in key export business especially in the manufacturing of exportable goods, 
the surrender requirement of Forex is revised to be 50/50 from 70/30 ratio previously, whereby 50% of 
Forex generated is to be surrendered to NBE, 40% to be utilized by the exporter and 10% to be left to the 
transaction processing bank. 
37.b. In the opinion of the Directors, except for the possible impact of the matter indicated in 37.a above, there were 
no significant post balance sheet events which could have a material effect on the state of affairs of the Bank as at 
30 June 2023 and on the profit for the period ended on that date, which have not been adequately provided for or 
disclosed.
