MESSAGE
OF THE BOARD CHAIRPERSON
Honorable Shareholders! 
On behalf of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Abyssinia S.C and myself, I am honored to 
present the Board of Directors’ Report along with the “Audited Financial Statements” of the Bank 
to the 23rd   Ordinary Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders of the Bank for the Fiscal Year 
2018/19 ended June 30, 2019. 
In the 2018/19 a number of ups and downs in economic activities were observed globally as well 
as in Ethiopia, with signifi
 cant implications to the national economy and political environment. 
The global economy saw set back after a decade of sustained expansion, mainly due to softened 
momentum in global activity following trade tension between the leading world economies, USA and 
China and prolonged uncertainty on Brexit (IMF’s WEO update, July 2019).  
The Ethiopian economy has also undergone a challenging time amidst continued security concerns, 
which aﬀ
 ected business activity, that was also compounded by lower than anticipated export 
earnings, and rising fuel oil price. These had put stress on trade balance, increasing price level, and 
forex shortage. Against the backdrop of these challenging circumstances, the Ethiopian economy 
had registered commendable growth at 8.5%.
It was under these challenging global and domestic economic conditions that the fi
 nancial sector 
posted strong performance in resource mobilization and profi
 t. Under the circumstances, it is my 
pleasure to express that Bank of Abyssinia has registered a commendable result in both fi
 nancial 
and non-fi
 nancial (operational) outcomes. 
During the ended fi
 scal year, Bank of Abyssinia had achieved a signifi
 cant incremental deposit 
growth and thus the total outstanding deposit balance reached Birr 32.15 billion as at June 30, 
2019, i.e. a 25% growth from Birr 25.79 billion of last year. Outstanding loans and advances 
increased by 32% and reached Birr 23.74 billion in 2018/19, from the 2017/18 position of Birr 17.99 
billion. The Bank earned a total revenue of Birr 4.29 billion which is an increase of Birr 1,024 million 
from Birr 3.27 billion in end of 2017/18. I am glad also to announce that the Bank has registered 
a remarkable profi
 t that reached Birr 1.02 billion before tax which is a high record in the Bank’s 
8 |  Bank of Abyssinia S.C Annual Report 2018/19
2018/19 Annual Report
history. Total asset and capital levels also increased by 23% and 17% registering Birr 39.29 billion 
and Birr 4.95 billion, respectively.
Furthermore, the Bank has been able to lay strong ground for sustainable growth and profi
 tability. 
In an eﬀ
 ort to bring sustainable growth and profi
 tability, there have been various activities and 
projects undertaken throughout the Bank. To mention few among the major ones, upgrading of 
the Bank’s T24 core banking system to the latest version, implementation of interest free banking 
products solution, development and implementation of new strategy have been carried out. In the 
year under review, the Bank has developed its fi
 ve-year strategy by using its own expertise in-
house. Accordingly, it has validated its vision, mission and core values, wherein the Bank identifi
 ed 
three pillars of excellence and key strategic drivers on which the Bank puts adequate focus in order 
to achieve strategic aspirations in the years to come. The Bank’s organizational structure has been 
reviewed accordingly in a manner that it supports achievement of the strategic objectives. Besides, 
in order to address strategic issues identifi
 ed in the course of strategy crafting, and to ensure 
continuous improvement in all areas of the Bank’s businesses, diﬀ
 erent strategic initiatives have 
been developed and are being implemented. 
The Bank also embarked on the work of various construction projects, to strengthen its asset 
position and good brand image, including the head oﬃ
  ce building fi
 nishing works. During the period 
under review, the fi
 nishing works of Ras Branch Building in which the head oﬃ
  ce resides has been 
kicked oﬀ
  and going well in a fast pace. The Bank fi
 nalized construction work of the G + 7 building 
at Belay Zeleke Road and a branch oﬃ
  ce has commenced delivering services. The G+6 building 
construction work in Hawassa town has continued, while fi
 nishing construction of a G+5 building in 
Jimma town has been commenced based on a new design and its progress is in a good condition. 
On top of these, the Bank is undertaking preparation of pre-construction works of the Bank’s future 
Headquarters building around Mexico Square. 
Honorable Shareholders! 
Bank of Abyssinia recognizes that it is operating in a rapidly changing banking environment, a 
number of challenges have been faced in the course of business undertakings. To cope with these 
dynamics in the external as well as internal environments, the Bank had undergone change in the 
management and adopted a new fi
 ve-year strategic plan and the ensuing organizational structure. 
With a view to realize the Bank’s vision, which is “To become a leading commercial bank in East 
Africa by 2030”, the Bank remains committed to pursuing these aspirations and thereby meet the 
interest of its stakeholders. 
Going forward, the Management and the entire employees of the Bank shall make renewed eﬀ
 ort 
to bring higher performance in the coming years of strategic period by executing strategic initiatives 
and projects in the areas of digitalization, human resources development, IT infrastructure, 
processes improvements and business development. Hence, the Board of Directors and the 
Management need unreserved support from all its stakeholders including shareholders, staﬀ
 , and 
the regulatory body.
I am sure, with the full support of all stakeholders at our disposal, we will achieve the targets set in 
the new strategy, play our role in the fi
 nancial inclusion agenda of the country and realize our vision 
to the satisfaction of all stakeholders.
Finally, on behalf of the Board of Directors and myself, I would like to seize this opportunity to 
express my sincere gratitude to our esteemed customers for their confi
 dence and trust to continue 
to do business with our Bank, to our shareholders for their support, to my fellow members of 
the Board of Directors, Executive Management and employees of BoA for their dedication and 
commitment, and to the National Bank of Ethiopia for its guidance. 
        Thank you all!!
      
        Messeret Taye

STATEMENT OF THE 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Dear Esteemed Shareholders,
It is my pleasure to brieﬂ
 y describe the 2018/19 fi
 scal year which has been a period of profound 
political and economic change. 
Global economic growth has subdued after a decade of strong growth. Government intervention, 
in the form of bailing out “too big to fail” banks and strong fi
 nancial stimulus were responsible for 
global economic expansion for the past decade. However, since the second half of 2018, global 
growth seemed to have reached its natural limit and economic slowdown set in. 
The Ethiopian economy had also felt this global slowdown through declining export performance, 
decreased FDI and price changes of fuel, which in unison accentuated the foreign exchange 
shortage, widening trade defi
 cit putting the country’s debt high. This again has been compounded 
with unfavorable business environment as a result of the eruption of conﬂ
 icts around the country, 
and rising price levels. Despite such conditions, the GDP growth in 2018/19 is still positive, which 
enfolds Ethiopia among the fastest growing economies. 
The ever-increasing profi
 t of the banking industry is indicative of the potential for further business 
expansion, though the past fi
 scal year have also hinted, more than ever, the inevitability of opening 
up the banking sector to foreign competition. While this may sound threatening, it would serve the 
banking sector as incentive to modernize and enhance its competitive edge. 
Our competitive position has been one among the leading peers which are moving farther ahead 
in the private banking industry. The fi
 nancial and non-fi
 nancial performance of our Bank, while 
encouraging, deviated from targets. Nevertheless, compared with last year performance, we 
registered encouraging results to build upon, which should be strengthened in the upcoming 
2019/20 fi
 scal year.  
10 |  Bank of Abyssinia S.C Annual Report 2018/19
2018/19 Annual Report
The total net deposit mobilized in the review period stood at Birr 6.35 billion having an  
accomplishment of 128.8% against last year same period increases. The deposit position of the 
Bank during the year 2018/19 had also reached Birr 32.1 billion. As a result of these, outstanding 
loans and advances reached Birr 23.7 billion, up by 32% compared to that of the year 2017/18.
The Bank’s profi
 tability has also continued to rise where it passed the one billion mark; increasing by 
Birr 258.3 million over the preceding year results. 
The Bank has continued extending its outreach, and branch network has expanded to 337 by 
opening 51 additional branches in the year 2018/19. In relation to that, the Bank’s deposit customer 
base has reached 1.3 million in number of accounts.
Furthermore, in an eﬀ
 ort to expand customer base in digital banking, the Bank managed to increase 
card holders and mobile banking users by more than hundred thousand each; and encouraging 
results registered in other digital banking services. 
In a nutshell, it is promising how much we have accomplished, not only in terms of fi
 nancial 
performance but in our steadfast dedication and readiness to enable the bank anchor its strategy on 
three thematic areas of growth, digitalization and operational excellence.  
Respected Shareholders
The new fi
 scal year is anticipated to be both challenging and exciting as the Bank is poised to 
strengthen its competitive position in the banking industry, and register remarkable growth following 
change of leadership and formulation of a new fi
 ve years corporate strategy. 
With visionary leadership from the Board of Directors, improved commitment from the management 
and staﬀ
  of the Bank; and having the patronage of our esteemed shareholders and customers at our 
side, I am confi
 dent that we will achieve far better results in the next fi
 scal year.
Finally, on behalf of the Executive Management and myself, I would like to thank the Board of 
Directors for their guidance and assistance; the Bank’s honored customers, shareholders and other 
stakeholders for their conviction and confi
 dence in our Bank’s every activity; and all employees for 
their unreserved eﬀ
 ort to materialize BoA’s aspirations during the year. 
        Thank you all!!

3.3 Business Development 
During the 2018/19 fi
 scal year, BoA has devised its fi
 fth generation of fi
 ve-year strategy that runs 
2019/20-2023/24. In this strategy the Bank has revised its area of business focus (value discipline) 
to Operational Excellence. The Bank strives to achieve competitive advantage by excelling in 
Operational Excellence while meeting industry standards in the other disciplines. In this way, BoA 
shall strive to bring excellence in products and services oﬀ
 erings across all channels, provide 
standardized, simple, and fast services, through continuous process improvement and eﬀ
 ective 
collaboration between front and back oﬃ
  ces. The strategy implementation goes in full force in the 
2019/20 fi
 scal year. 
To gain market advantage, the Bank has undertaken a range of marketing activities including 
strengthening of new savings deposit initiatives, namely Balewiletawoch (for senior citizens), Aday 
(women’s savings) and Aﬂ
 a (for the youth) on top of the Muday savings product which was launched 
earlier. Besides, during the year under review, the Bank has expanded oﬀ
 ering Interest Free Banking 
services to its esteemed customers. As a result, a sizeable amount of deposit has been mobilized 
through these deposit initiatives. 
During the stated period, the Bank had continued undertaking various business initiatives aimed 
at increasing accessibility wherein mobile fi
 nancial service project is a major one. The initiative is 
part of the digitalization objective of the Bank by providing an electronic payment platform through 
mobile wallet. The phase I mobile wallet product development and phase II integration of the 
mobile wallet with the core banking and Switch are complete. Integration with third party entities for 
value added services are awaiting approval from NBE. 
3.4 Information Systems 
The Bank has continually been undertaking changes and improvements to its IT and operational 
systems. In this regard, BoA has elevated its Core Banking System from R10 release to R17, the 
scope of which includes such key operational areas as Retail Banking, Credit Operations, Finance 
and Accounts, Treasury Functions and Trade Finance Operations. In this relation the Bank also 
implemented interest free banking products on the system which has been synchronized for Interest 
free deposit and fi
 nancing as well. 
Furthermore, the Bank has also invested in the deployment of electronic channels including ATM, 
PoS, and started enhancement and improvement works in its internet banking while mobile fi
 nancial 
services system has been undergoing pilot test to get approval from the National Bank of Ethiopia. 
In this regard, in end of 2018/19, the number of ATM and PoS machines deployed grew by 56 
and 91, respectively from that of the previous year. On top of that, the Bank managed to increase 
the number of card holders and mobile banking users by 131,661 and 133,105, respectively as

4. Adoption of IFRS
With the enactment of proclamation no 847/2014, i.e. “Financial Report Proclamation of Ethiopia”, 
banks, insurance companies and public enterprises are required to comply with the International 
Financial Reporting System (IFRS).  The Accounting and Auditing Board of Ethiopia which is in 
charge of coordinating, and mandated to enforce the implementation of IFRS in the country, has 
indicated that fi
 nancial institutions are required to implement IFRS by end of 2018 and onwards. 
Consequently, the Bank had adopted IFRS last year and issued its fi
 nancial reports of the fi
 scal year 
2017/18 in accordance with IFRS. 
For the year 2018/19 also BoA has implemented IFRS 9: Financial Instruments, which replaces the 
earlier version of IAS 39: Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement. As IFRS in general 
and IFRS 9 in particular is a new fi
 nancial reporting standard to the Country as well as to the 
Banking Industry, BoA has faced multiple challenges mainly due to lack of adequate and organized 
data and record keeping; which is common experience to other similar institutions.
However, having these challenges, the Bank has successfully implemented IFRS 9 and produced its 
2018/19 FY fi
 nancial statements in accordance with IFRS 9. With the lessons in the process, BoA is 
further working on necessary adjustments and requirements. In this regard, it is with pleasure that 
the Bank’s Management present its fi
 nancial statement using IFRS.
21
5. Future Plan 
BoA has been operating actively in the industry and contributed its share towards economic and 
social stability and growth of the economy through playing the key roles of deposit mobilization and 
credit creation. The Bank is also ready to discharge such responsibilities and key role in a better way 
in the upcoming fi
 scal year. 
With a view to enhance its growth and sustainable profi
 tability, the Bank has drawn up a new 
fi
 ve-year strategy after assessing external and internal environment in which the Bank operates. 
In this strategy the Bank put adequate focus on growth operational excellence and digitalization 
for realizing the strategy objectives. The Bank shall invest more time and energy to strengthen 
the sustainable growth of resource mobilization and optimal allocation of the resources. To realize 
this, the Bank shall work on various digital banking technology platforms and IT infrastructure 
developments in the course of implementing the new strategy emphasizing operational eﬃ
  ciency 
and digital capability. In this connection, branch expansion will go hand in hand with the digital 
presence so as to reach various segments of the population by enabling customers receive seamless 
experience across service points. In addition, the Bank shall expand the IFB services further through 
introduction of variety of IFB products and service oﬀ
 erings, including by establishing dedicated 
service giving outlets to bring large potential customers to the service. Strategic initiatives will also 
receive adequate time and resources in the coming fi
 scal year which would enable the Bank to 
achieve its corporate strategy objectives. 
For the Bank to materialize the envisioned targets and attain its aspirations, therefore, it calls for the 
concerted eﬀ
 orts of all stakeholders of the Bank, i.e., the Board of Directors, Executive Management 
and all employees towards the successful implementation of the strategic initiatives. 
6. Appropriation of Retained Earnings 
During the Fiscal Year 2018/19, the Bank secured a net profi
 t of Birr 483.34 million after the 
appropriate deductions were made from the gross profi
 t of the fi
 scal year.
The Board of Directors, therefore, recommends that Birr 481.99 million be distributed to 
shareholders, proportionate to their respective paid-up shares after deducting the share of the Board 
of Directors, which is Birr 1.35 million.

BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
1. General information
Bank of Abyssinia (“the Bank”) is a public owned share Company domiciled in Ethiopia. The Bank was 
established in (1996) in accordance with the Licensing & Supervision of Banking Business Proclamation 
No.84/1994 (as amended by 592/2008) and the Commercial Code of Ethiopia of 1960.
The Bank opened branches throughout the country. The Bank’s registered oﬃ
  ce is at:
Legehar  Building
Gambia Street
P.O Box 12947
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
The Bank is principally engaged in the provision of diverse range of fi
 nancial products and services to a 
wholesale, retail and SME clients base in Ethiopian Market.
2. Summary of signiﬁ
 cant accounting policies
2.1 Introduction to summary of signiﬁ
 cant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these fi
 nancial statements are set out below. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.2 Basis of preparation
The fi
 nancial statements for the period ended 30 June 2019 have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (“IASB”). Additional information required by national regulations is included where appropriate. 
The fi
 nancial statements comprise the statement of profi
 t or loss and other comprehensive income, the 
statement of fi
 nancial position, the statement of changes in equity, the statement of cash ﬂ
 ows and the 
notes to the fi
 nancial statements.
The fi
 nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern principle under the 
historical cost concept, except for the following;
  Buildings under  property, plant and equipment  – measured at fair value as deemed cost
   
Assets held for sale – measured at fair value less cost of disposal, and
  Defi
 ned benefi
 t pension plans – plan assets measured at fair value.
All values are rounded to the nearest thousand, except when otherwise indicated. The fi
 nancial statements 
are presented in thousands of Ethiopian Birr (Birr’ 000).
The preparation of fi
 nancial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical 
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying 
the Bank’s accounting policies. Changes in assumptions may have a signifi
 cant impact on the fi
 nancial 
statements in the period the assumptions changed. Management believes that the underlying assumptions 
are appropriate and that the Bank’s fi
 nancial statements therefore present the fi
 nancial position and results 
fairly. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and 
estimates are signifi
 cant to the fi
 nancial statements, are disclosed in Note 4.
11
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
2.2.1 Going concern
The fi
 nancial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The management have no doubt 
that the Bank would remain in existence after 12 months.
2.2.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
The Bank has initially adopted IFRS 9 from 1 July2018, a number of other new standards are also eﬀ
 ective 
from 1 July 2018. Due to the transition method chosen by the Bank in applying IFRS 9, comparative 
information throughout these fi
 nancial statements has not generally been restated to reﬂ
 ect its requirements. 
The eﬀ
 ect of initially applying these standards is mainly attributed to the following:
– An increase in impairment losses recognised on fi
 nancial assets (Note (4.4); and
– Additional disclosures related to IFRS 9 (see Notes 2.5and 4.4);
Except for the changes below, the Bank has consistently applied the accounting policies as set out in Note 
2.5 to all periods presented in these fi
 nancial statements.
IFRS 9 sets out requirements for recognising and measuring fi
 nancial assets, fi
 nancial liabilities and 
some contracts to buy or sell non-fi
 nancial items. This standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement. The requirements of IFRS 9 represent a signifi
 cant change from IAS 39. The 
new standard brings fundamental changes to the accounting for fi
 nancial assets and to certain aspects of 
the accounting for fi
 nancial liabilities.
As a result of the adoption of IFRS 9, the Bank has adopted consequential amendments to IAS 1 Presentation 
of Financial Statements, which require separate presentation in the statement of profi
 t or loss and OCI of 
interest revenue calculated using the eﬀ
 ective interest method. Previously, the Bank disclosed this amount 
in the notes to the fi
 nancial statements. Additionally, the Bank has adopted consequential amendments to 
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures that are applied to disclosures about 2018, but have not been 
applied to the comparative information. The key changes to the Bank’s accounting policies resulting from its 
adoption of IFRS 9 are summarised below. The full impact of adopting the standard is set out in Note 4.4.
Transition from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 
Changes in accounting policies resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 have been applied retrospectively, 
except comparative periods which have generally not been restated. Diﬀ
 erences in the carrying amounts 
of fi
 nancial assets and fi
 nancial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained 
earnings and reserves as at 1 July 2018.  Accordingly, the information presented for 2018does not reﬂ
 ect the 
requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2019 under IFRS 
9. The Bank used the exemption not to restate comparative periods but considering that the amendments 
made by IFRS 9 to IAS 1 introduced the requirement to present ‘interest income calculated using the 
eﬀ
 ective interest rate’ as a separate line item in the statement of profi
 t or loss and OCI, the Bank changed 
the description of the line item from ‘interest income’ reported in 2018to ‘interest income calculated using 
the eﬀ
 ective interest method’. The following assessments have been made on the basis of the facts and 
circumstances that existed at the date of initial application;
 The determination of the business model within which a fi
 nancial asset is held.
 The designation and revocation of previous designations of certain fi
 nancial assets and fi
 nancial    
   liabilities as measured at FVTPL.
 The designation of investments in equity instruments not held for trading as at FVOCI.
 If a debt security had low credit risk at the date of initial application of IFRS 9, then the Bank has  
   assumed that credit risk on the asset had not increased signifi
 cantly since its initial recognition.

2018/19 Annual Report
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
New Standards, amendments, interpretations issued but not yet eﬀ
 ective. 
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are eﬀ
 ective for annual 
periods beginning after 30 June 2019, and have not been applied in preparing these fi
 nancial statements. 
None of these is expected to have a signifi
 cant eﬀ
 ect on the fi
 nancial statements of the Bank, except the 
following set out below:
IFRS 16 - Leases
This standard was issued in January 2016 (Eﬀ
 ective on after 1 January 2019) . It sets out the principles 
for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. The objective is to ensure that 
lessees and lessors provide relevant information in a manner that faithfully represents those transactions. 
The standard introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise assets and 
liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. A 
lessee is required to recognise a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset 
and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. it also substantially carries forward 
the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17.  The Bank is partially assess the expected impact of this 
standard but not implemented in this accounting period. 
IFRIC 23 Uncertainity over Income Tax Treatments
IFRIC 23 ‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments’ This interpretation clarifi
 es how to apply the recognition 
and measurement requirements in IAS 12 when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. In such 
circumstances, an entity shall recognise and measure its current or deferred tax asset or liability applying the 
requirements in IAS 12 based on taxable profi
 t (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits 
and tax rates determined applying this Interpretation. This interpretation addresses: whether an entity 
considers uncertain tax treatments separately; the assumptions an entity makes about the examination 
of tax treatments by taxation authorities; how an entity determines taxable profi
 t (tax loss), tax bases, 
unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates; and how an entity considers changes in facts and 
circumstances. The IFRIC will be applied retrospectively. The impact on the annual fi
 nancial statements 
has not yet been fully determined. The new interpretation is eﬀ
 ective on after 1 January 2019 and earlier 
application is permitted. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of this IFRIC.
IFRIC Interpretation 22 - Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration
The interpretation clarifi
 es that in determining the spot exchange rate to use on initial recognition of 
the related asset, expense or income (or part of it) on the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or 
non-monetary liability relating to advance consideration, the date of the transaction is the date on 
which an entity initially recognises the nonmonetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from 
the advance consideration. If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, then the entity 
must determine a date of the transactions for each payment or receipt of advance consideration.
Entities may apply the amendments on a fully retrospective basis. Alternatively, an entity may apply the 
interpretation prospectively to all assets, expenses and income in its scope that are initially recognised on 
or after:
(i) The beginning of the reporting period in which the entity fi
 rst applies the interpretation or;
(ii) The beginning of a prior reporting period presented as comparative information in the fi
 nancial 
statements of the reporting period in which the entity fi
 rst applies the interpretation.
2.3 Foreign currency translation
a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the fi
 nancial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Bank operates (‘the functional currency’). The functional currency and presentation 
currency of the Bank is the Ethiopian Birr (Birr). 
13
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing 
at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of 
foreign currency transactions and from the translation at exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in currencies other than the Bank’s functional currency are recognised in profi
 t or loss within 
other (loss)/income. Monetary items denominated in foreign currency are translated using the closing rate 
as at the reporting date.
Changes 
in 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
monetary 
securities 
denominated 
in 
foreign 
currency 
classifi
 ed 
as 
available 
for 
sale 
are 
analysed 
between 
translation 
diﬀ
 erences 
resulting 
from 
changes 
in 
the 
amortised 
cost 
of 
the 
security 
and 
other 
changes in the carrying amount of the security. Translation diﬀ
 erences related to changes in amortised cost are 
recognised 
in 
profi
 t 
or 
loss, 
and 
other 
changes 
in 
carrying 
amount 
are 
recognised 
in 
other 
comprehensive 
income.
Translation diﬀ
 erences on non-monetary fi
 nancial assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value 
through profi
 t or loss are recognised in profi
 t or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation 
diﬀ
 erences on non-monetary fi
 nancial assets measure at fair value, such as equities classifi
 ed as available 
for sale, are included in other comprehensive income.
2.4 Recognition of income and expenses
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefi
 ts will ﬂ
 ow 
to the Bank and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is 
being made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, 
taking into account contractually defi
 ned terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty.
The Bank, earns income from interest on  loans given for domestic trade and services, building and 
construction, manufacturing, agriculture and personal loans. Other incomes includes margins on letter of 
credits and performance guarantees.
2.4.1 Interest and similar income and expense
For all the government bills measured at amortised cost and interest bearing fi
 nancial assets classifi
 ed as 
available– for–sale interest income or expense is recorded using the Eﬀ
 ective Interest Rate (EIR), which 
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of 
the fi
 nancial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the fi
 nancial 
asset or fi
 nancial liability. The calculation takes into account all contractual terms of the fi
 nancial instrument 
(for example, prepayment options) and includes any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable 
to the instrument and are an integral part of the Eﬀ
 ective Interest Rate (EIR), but not future credit losses.
The carrying amount of the fi
 nancial asset or fi
 nancial liability is adjusted if the Bank revises its estimates of 
payments or receipts. The adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the original EIR and the change 
in carrying amount is recorded as ‘Interest and similar income’ for fi
 nancial assets and Interest and similar 
expense for fi
 nancial liabilities.
Once the recorded value of a fi
 nancial asset or a group of similar fi
 nancial assets has been reduced due to 
an impairment loss, interest income continues to be recognised using the rate of interest used to discount 
the future cash ﬂ
 ows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
2.4.2 Fees and commission
Fees and commission income and expenses that are integral to the eﬀ
 ective interest rate on a fi
 nancial 
asset - government bills or liability are included in the measurement of the eﬀ
 ective interest rate. Other 
fees and commission income; money transfer, letter of credit, payment orders, uncleared eﬀ
 ects, ATM and 
POS transactions etc are recognised as the related services are performed.

2018/19 Annual Report
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
When a loan commitment is not expected to result in the draw-down of a loan, loan commitment fees are 
recognised on a straight-line basis over the commitment period.
Other fees and commission expenses relates mainly to transaction and service fees are expensed as the 
services are received.
2.4.3 Dividend income
This is recognised when the Bank’s right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when the 
shareholders approve and declare the dividend.
2.4.4 Foreign exchange revaluation gains or losses
These 
are 
gains 
and 
losses 
arising 
on 
settlement 
and 
translation 
of 
monetary 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
denominated 
in foreign currencies at the functional currency’s spot rate of exchange at the reporting date.  This amount 
is recognised in the income statement and it is further broken down into realised and unrealised portion. 
 
The monetary assets and liabilities include fi
 nancial assets within the foreign currencies deposits received 
and held on behalf of third parties etc.   
2.5 Financial assets and ﬁ
 nancial liabilities
2.5.1 Policy applicable from 1 July 2018
a. Recognition and initial measurement
The Bank shall initially recognise loans and advances, deposits, debt securities issued and subordinated 
liabilities on the date on which they are originated. All other fi
 nancial instruments (including regular-way 
purchases and sales of fi
 nancial assets) shall be recognised on the trade date, which is the date on which 
the Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
A fi
 nancial asset or fi
 nancial liability shall be measured initially at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value 
through profi
 t or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. 
b. Classiﬁ
 cation and subsequent measurement
i)  Financial assets
On initial recognition, a fi
 nancial asset shall be classifi
 ed either as measured at either amortised cost, fair 
value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profi
 t or loss (FVTPL). 
The Bank shall measure a fi
 nancial asset at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and 
is not designated at FVTPL: 
  The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash 
ﬂ
 ows; and 
  The contractual terms of the fi
 nancial asset give rise on specifi
 ed dates to cash ﬂ
 ows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest (SPPI). `
     A debt instrument shall be measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is 
not designated at FVTPL: 
  The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash 
ﬂ
 ows and selling fi
 nancial assets; and 
  The contractual terms of the fi
 nancial asset give rise on specifi
 ed dates to cash ﬂ
 ows that are SPPI. 
On initial recognition, an equity investment that is held for trading shall be classifi
 ed at FVTPL.  However, 
for equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent 
changes in fair value in other comprehensive income (OCI). This election is made on an investment-by-
investment basis. 
15
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
All other fi
 nancial assets that do not meet the classifi
 cation criteria at amortised cost or FVOCI, above, shall 
be classifi
 ed as measured at FVTPL. 
In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a fi
 nancial asset that otherwise 
meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates 
or signifi
 cantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise (see 1.8).
 Business model assessment 
    The Bank shall make an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at 
a portfolio levelbecause this best reﬂ
 ects the way the business is managed and information is provided to 
management. The information considered includes: 
 The stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In 
particular, whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest revenue, maintaining a 
particular interest rate profi
 le, matching the duration of the fi
 nancial assets to the duration of the liabilities 
that are funding those assets or realising cash ﬂ
 ows through the sale of the assets; 
 How the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Bank’s management; 
  The risks that aﬀ
 ect the performance of the business model (and the fi
 nancial assets held within that 
business model) and its strategy for how those risks are managed; 
 How managers of the business are compensated (e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value 
of the assets managed or the contractual cash ﬂ
 ows collected); and 
 The frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations 
about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but 
as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank’s stated objective for managing the fi
 nancial assets is 
achieved and how cash ﬂ
 ows are realised. 
Financial assets shall not be reclassifi
 ed subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after 
the Bank changes its business model for managing fi
 nancial assets. 
Assessment of whether contractual cash ﬂ
 ows are solely payments of principal and interest 
For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ shall be defi
 ned as the fair value of the fi
 nancial asset on 
initial recognition. ‘Interest’ shall be defi
 ned as the consideration for the time value of money and for the 
credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other 
basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as profi
 t margin. 
In assessing whether the contractual cash ﬂ
 ows are SPPI, the Bank considers the contractual terms of 
the instrument. This includes assessing whether the fi
 nancial asset contains a contractual term that could 
change the timing or amount of contractual cash ﬂ
 ows such that it would not meet this condition. In making 
the assessment, the Bank considers: 
 Contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash ﬂ
 ows; 
 leverage features; 
 Prepayment and extension terms; 
 Terms that limit the Bank’s claim to cash ﬂ
 ows from specifi
 ed assets (e.g. non-recourse loans); and 
 Features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates). 
ii)  Financial liabilities
The Bank shall classify its fi
 nancial liabilities, other than fi
 nancial guarantees and loan commitments, as 
measured at amortised cost or FVTPL.

BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
A fi
 nancial guarantee is an undertaking/commitment that requires the issuer to make specifi
 ed payments 
to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specifi
 ed party fails to meet its obligation when due 
in accordance with the contractual terms.
Financial guarantees issued by the Bank are initially measured at their fair values and, if not designated as 
at FVTPL,are subsequently measured at the higher of: the amount of the obligation under the guarantee, 
as determined in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, ContingentLiabilities and Contingent Assets; and the 
amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance 
withthe revenue recognition policies.
c. Impairment
At each reporting date, the Bank shall assess whether there is objective evidence that fi
 nancial assets 
(except equity investments), other than those carried at FVTPL, are impaired.
The Bank shall recognise loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECL) on the following fi
 nancial 
instruments that are not measured at FVTPL: 
  Financial assets that are debt instruments; 
  lease receivables; 
  Financial guarantee contracts issued; and 
  loan commitments issued. 
No impairment loss shall be recognised on equity investments. 
The Bank shall measure loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except for the following, which 
are measured as 12-month ECL: 
  Debt investment securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and 
  Other fi
 nancial instruments (other than lease receivables) on which credit risk has not increased 
signifi
 cantly since their initial recognition. 
Loss allowances for lease receivables shall always be measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. 12-month 
ECL is the portion of ECL that result from default events on a fi
 nancial instrument that are possible within 
the 12 months after the reporting date. Financial instruments for which a 12-month ECL is recognised are 
referred to as ‘Stage 1 fi
 nancial instruments’. 
Life-time ECL is the ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the fi
 nancial 
instrument. Financial instruments for which a lifetime ECL is recognised but which are not credit-impaired 
are referred to as ‘Stage 2 fi
 nancial instruments’. 
i) Measurement of ECL 
ECL is a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. It shall be measured as follows: 
 For fi
 nancial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date (stage 1 and 2):as the present 
value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the diﬀ
 erence between the cash ﬂ
 ows due to the Bank in accordance with 
the contract and the cash ﬂ
 ows that the Bank expects to receive); 
 For fi
 nancial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date (stage 3): as the diﬀ
 erence between 
the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂ
 ows; 
 For undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the diﬀ
 erence between the contractual cash 
ﬂ
 ows that are due to the Bank if the commitment is drawn down and the cash ﬂ
 ows that the Bank expects 
to receive; and 
 For fi
 nancial guarantee contracts: as the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts 
that the Bank expects to recover.

ii)  Restructured ﬁ
 nancial assets 
Where the terms of a fi
 nancial asset are renegotiated or modifi
 ed or an existing fi
 nancial asset is replaced 
with a new one due to fi
 nancial diﬃ
  culties of the borrower, then the Bank shall assess whether the fi
 nancial 
asset should be derecognised and ECL are measured as follows:
 If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected 
cash ﬂ
 ows arising from the modifi
 ed fi
 nancial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the 
existing asset 
 If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair 
value of the new asset is treated as the fi
 nal cash ﬂ
 ow from the existing fi
 nancial asset at the time of its 
derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing fi
 nancial asset 
that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original 
eﬀ
 ective interest rate of the existing fi
 nancial asset. 
iii) Credit-impaired ﬁ
 nancial assets 
At each reporting date, the Bank shall assess whether fi
 nancial assets carried at amortised cost, debt 
fi
 nancial assets carried at FVOCI, and fi
 nance lease receivables are credit-impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 
fi
 nancial assets’). 
A fi
 nancial asset shall be considered ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental 
impact on the estimated future cash ﬂ
 ows of the fi
 nancial asset have occurred. 
Evidence that a fi
 nancial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data: 
 Signifi
 cant fi
 nancial diﬃ
  culty of the borrower or issuer; 
 A breach of contract such as a default or past due event; 
 The restructuring of a loan or advance by the Bank on terms that the Bank would not consider otherwise; 
 It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other fi
 nancial reorganisation; or 
 The disappearance of an active market for a security because of fi
 nancial diﬃ
  culties. 
    A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition shall be considered 
to be credit-impair unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash ﬂ
 ows has reduced 
signifi
 cantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 
days or more shall be considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory defi
 nition of default is diﬀ
 erent. 
iv) Presentation of allowance for ECL in the statement of ﬁ
 nancial position 
     Loss allowances for ECL shall be presented in the statement of fi
 nancial position as follows: 
 For fi
 nancial assets measured at amortised cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the 
assets; 
 For loan commitments and fi
 nancial guarantee contracts: generally, as a provision; 
 Where a fi
 nancial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Bank cannot 
identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from those on the drawn component: the 
Bank presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The combined amount is presented as a 
deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over 
the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision; and 
 For debt instruments measured at FVOCI: no loss allowance is recognised in the statement of fi
 nancial 
position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance shall 
be disclosed and is recognised in the fair value reserve. 
v) Write-oﬀ
  
     Loans and debt securities shall be written oﬀ
  (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable

BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
expectation of recovering the amount in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when 
the Bank determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate 
suﬃ
  cient cash ﬂ
 ows to repay the amounts subject to the write-oﬀ
 . This assessment shall be carried out at 
the individual asset level. 
Recoveries of amounts previously written oﬀ
  shall be included in ‘impairment losses on fi
 nancial instruments’ 
in the statement of profi
 t or loss and OCI.
Financial assets that are written oﬀ
  could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with 
the Bank’s procedures for recovery of amounts due. 
vi) Non-integral ﬁ
 nancial guarantee contracts 
The Bank shall assess whether a fi
 nancial guarantee contract held is an integral element of a fi
 nancial asset 
that is accounted for as a component of that instrument or is a contract that is accounted for separately. 
Where the Bank determines that the guarantee is an integral element of the fi
 nancial asset, then any 
premium payable in connection with the initial recognition of the fi
 nancial asset shall be treated as a 
transaction cost of acquiring it. The Bank shall consider the eﬀ
 ect of the protection when measuring the 
fair value of the debt instrument and when measuring ECL. 
Where the Bank determines that the guarantee is not an integral element of the debt instrument, then it 
shall recognise an asset representing any prepayment of guarantee premium and a right to compensation 
for credit losses. 
d. Derecognition
i)  Financial assets 
The Bank shall derecognise a fi
 nancial asset when:
 The contractual right to the cash ﬂ
 ows from the fi
 nancial asset expires (see also (1.4)), or 
 It transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash ﬂ
 ows in a transaction in which substantially all of 
the risks and rewards of ownership of the fi
 nancial asset are transferred; or
 Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does 
not retain control of the fi
 nancial asset. On derecognition of a fi
 nancial asset, the diﬀ
 erence between the 
carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) 
and the sum of (i) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability 
assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI shall be recognised in profi
 t 
or loss. 
Any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI 
shall not be recognised in profi
 t or loss on derecognition of such securities.  Any interest in transferred 
fi
 nancial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Bank shall be recognised as 
a separate asset or liability. 
ii) Financial liabilities
The Bank shall derecognise a fi
 nancial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, 
or expire. 
e. Modiﬁ
 cations of ﬁ
 nancial assets and ﬁ
 nancial liabilities
i) Financial assets 
If the terms of a fi
 nancial asset are modifi
 ed, then the Bank shall evaluate whether the cash ﬂ
 ows of the 
modifi
 ed asset are substantially diﬀ
 erent. If the cash ﬂ
 ows are substantially diﬀ
 erent, then the 
19
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
contractual rights to cash ﬂ
 ows from the original fi
 nancial asset shall be deemed to have expired. In 
this case, the original fi
 nancial asset shall be derecognised (see (1.3)) and a new fi
 nancial asset shall be 
recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modifi
 cation 
shall be accounted for as follows: 
 Fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent 
reimbursement of eligible transaction costs shall be included in the initial measurement of the asset; and 
 Other fees are included in profi
 t or loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition. 
    If cash ﬂ
 ows are modifi
 ed when the borrower is in fi
 nancial diﬃ
  culties, then the objective of the 
modifi
 cation is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new 
asset with substantially diﬀ
 erent terms.
If the Bank plans to modify a fi
 nancial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash ﬂ
 ows, then it 
shall fi
 rst consider whether a portion of the asset should be written oﬀ
  before the modifi
 cation takes place.
Where the modifi
 cation of a fi
 nancial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in 
derecognition of the fi
 nancial asset, then the Bank shall fi
 rst recalculate the gross carrying amount of the 
fi
 nancial asset using the original eﬀ
 ective interest rate of the asset and recognises the resulting adjustment 
as a modifi
 cation gain or loss in profi
 t or loss. Any costs or fees incurred and fees receivedas part of the 
modifi
 cation adjust the gross carrying amount of the modifi
 ed fi
 nancial asset and shall be amortised over 
the remaining term of the modifi
 ed fi
 nancial asset. 
Where such a modifi
 cation is carried out because of fi
 nancial diﬃ
  culties of the borrower, then the gain or 
loss shall be presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it shall be presented as interest 
income calculated using the eﬀ
 ective interest rate method. 
ii) Financial liabilities 
The Bank shall derecognise a fi
 nancial liability when its terms are modifi
 ed and the cash ﬂ
 ows of the 
modifi
 ed liability are substantially diﬀ
 erent. In this case, a new fi
 nancial liability based on the modifi
 ed 
terms shall be recognised at fair value. The diﬀ
 erence between the carrying amount of the fi
 nancial liability 
derecognised and consideration paid is recognised in profi
 t or loss. Consideration paid shall include non-
fi
 nancial assets transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modifi
 ed fi
 nancial 
liability. 
Where the modifi
 cation of a fi
 nancial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost 
of the liability shall be recalculated by discounting the modifi
 ed cash ﬂ
 ows at the original eﬀ
 ective interest 
rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profi
 t or loss.Any costs and fees incurred are recognised 
as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the 
modifi
 ed fi
 nancial liability by re-computing the eﬀ
 ective interest rate on the instrument. 
f. Oﬀ
 setting
Financial assets and fi
 nancial liabilities shall be oﬀ
 set and the net amount presented in the statement of 
fi
 nancial position when, and only when, the Bank currently has a legally enforceable right to set oﬀ
  the 
amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously.
 
Income and expenses shall be presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS, or for gains and 
losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Bank’s trading activity.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
g. Designation at fair value through proﬁ
 t or loss
i) Financial assets 
At initial recognition, the Bank may designate certain fi
 nancial assets as at FVTPL because this designation 
eliminates or signifi
 cantly reduces an accounting mismatch, which would otherwise arise. 
ii) Financial liabilities 
The Bank shall designate certain fi
 nancial liabilities as at FVTPL in either of the following circumstances: 
 The liabilities are managed, evaluated and reported internally on a fair value basis; or 
 The designation eliminates or signifi
 cantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. 
2.5.2. Policy applicable before 1 July 2018
a. Recognition
The Bank initially recognises loans and advances, deposits and debt securities on the date at which they are 
originated. All other fi
 nancial assets and liabilities (including assets designated at fair value through profi
 t 
or loss) are initially recognised on the trade date at which the Bank becomes a party to the contractual 
provision of the instrument.
A fi
 nancial asset or liability is initially measured at fair value plus (for an item not subsequently measured 
at fair value through profi
 t or loss) transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, fi
 nancial liabilities (deposits and debt securities) are measured at their 
amortized cost using the eﬀ
 ective interest method. 
b. Classiﬁ
 cation
The Bank classifi
 es its fi
 nancial assets in the following categories: fi
 nancial assets at fair value through 
profi
 t or loss; loans and receivables; held-to-maturity investments; and available-for-sale fi
 nancial assets. 
Management determines the classifi
 cation of its investments at initial recognition.
i) Financial assets at fair value through proﬁ
 t or loss
This category has two sub-categories: fi
 nancial assets held for trading, and those designated at fair value 
through profi
 t or loss at inception. A fi
 nancial asset is classifi
 ed in this category if acquired principally for 
the purpose of selling in the short term or if so designated by management. 
Investments held for trading are those which were either acquired for generating a profi
 t from short-term 
ﬂ
 uctuations in price or dealer’s margin, or are securities included in a portfolio in which a pattern of short-
term profi
 t-taking exists. Investments held for trading are subsequently re-measured at fair value based on 
quoted bid prices or dealer price quotations, without any deduction for transaction costs. All related realized 
and unrealized gains and losses are included in profi
 t or loss. Interest earned whilst holding held for trading 
investments is reported as interest income.
Foreign exchange forward and spot contracts are classifi
 ed as held for trading. They are marked to market 
and are carried at their fair value. Fair values are obtained from discounted cash ﬂ
 ow models which are 
used in the determination of the foreign exchange forward and spot contract rates. Gains and losses on 
foreign exchange forward and spot contracts are included
ii) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative fi
 nancial assets with fi
 xed or determinable payments that are not 
quoted in an active market. They arise when the Bank provides money directly to a debtor with no intention 
of trading the receivable. Loans and advances are initially measured at fair value plus incremental direct 
transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the eﬀ
 ective interest method. Loans 
and receivables compose of loans and advances and cash and cash equivalents.
21
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
iii)  Held to maturity
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative fi
 nancial assets with fi
 xed or determinable payments and 
fi
 xed maturities that the Bank’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. A 
sale or reclassifi
 cation of more than an insignifi
 cant amount of held to maturity investments would result in 
the reclassifi
 cation of the entire category as available for sale and would prevent the Bank from classifying 
investment securities as held to maturity for the current and the following two fi
 nancial years. Held to 
maturity investments includes treasury bills and bonds. They are subsequently measured at amortized cost 
using the eﬀ
 ective interest rate method.
iv)  Available-for-sale
Available-for-sale fi
 nancial investments are those non-derivative fi
 nancial assets that are designated as 
available-for-sale or are not classifi
 ed as any other category of fi
 nancial assets. Available-for-sale fi
 nancial 
assets are recognized initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent 
to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognized in other 
comprehensive income and presented in the available-for-sale fair value reserve in equity. When an 
investment is derecognized, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is re-classifi
 ed to profi
 t or loss.
c. Identiﬁ
 cation and measurement of impairment of ﬁ
 nancial assets
At each reporting date the Bank assesses whether there is objective evidence that fi
 nancial assets not 
carried at fair value through profi
 t or loss are impaired. Financial assets are impaired when objective 
evidence demonstrates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the 
loss event has an impact on the future cash ﬂ
 ows on the asset than can be estimated reliably.
The Bank considers evidence of impairment at both a specifi
 c asset and collective level. All individually 
signifi
 cant fi
 nancial assets are assessed for specifi
 c impairment. Signifi
 cant assets found not to be specifi
 cally 
impaired are then collectively assessed for any impairment that may have been incurred but not yet 
identifi
 ed. Assets that are not individually signifi
 cant are collectively assessed for impairment by grouping 
together fi
 nancial assets with similar risk characteristics.
Objective evidence that fi
 nancial assets (including equity securities) are impaired can include default or 
delinquency by a borrower, restructuring of a loan or advance by the Bank on terms that the Bank would 
otherwise not consider, indications that a borrower or issuer will enter bankruptcy, the disappearance of 
an active market for a security, or other observable data relating to a group of assets such as adverse 
changes in the payment status of borrowers or issuers in the group, or economic conditions that correlate 
with defaults in the Bank.
In assessing collective impairment the Bank uses historical trends of the probability of default, timing of 
recoveries and the amount of loss incurred, adjusted for management’s judgment as to whether current 
economic and credit conditions are such that the actual losses are likely to be greater or less than suggested 
by historical trends. Default rate, loss rates and the expected timing of future recoveries are regularly 
benchmarked against actual outcomes to ensure that they remain appropriate.
Impairment losses on assets carried at amortized cost are measured as the diﬀ
 erence between the carrying 
amount of the fi
 nancial assets and the present value of estimated cash ﬂ
 ows discounted at the assets’ 
original eﬀ
 ective interest rate. Losses are recognised in profi
 t or loss and reﬂ
 ected in an allowance account 
against loans and receivables or held-to-maturity investment securities. Interest on the impaired asset 
continues to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount.
Impairment losses on available-for-sale securities are recognised by reclassifying the losses accumulated in 
the fair value reserve in equity to profi
 t or loss. The cumulative loss that is reclassifi
 ed from equity to profi
 t 
or loss is the diﬀ
 erence between the acquisition cost, net of any principal repayment and amortisation, and 
the current fair value, less any impairment loss recognised previously in profi
 t or loss.

2018/19 Annual Report
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the impairment loss is 
reversed through profi
 t or loss.
d. De-recognition
The Bank derecognizes a fi
 nancial asset when the contractual rights to the cash ﬂ
 ows from the fi
 nancial 
asset expire, or when it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash ﬂ
 ows on the fi
 nancial asset 
in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the fi
 nancial asset are 
transferred. Any interest in transferred fi
 nancial assets that is created or retained by the Bank is recognized 
as a separate asset or liability.
The Bank derecognizes a fi
 nancial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or 
expire. On derecognition of a fi
 nancial asset, the diﬀ
 erence between the carrying amount of the asset and 
the sum of (i) the consideration received and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in 
other comprehensive income is recognised in profi
 t or loss.
The Bank enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognized on its statement of fi
 nancial 
position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets or 
a portion of them. If all or substantially all risks and rewards are retained, then the transferred assets 
are not derecognized from the statement of fi
 nancial position. Transfers of assets with retention of all or 
substantially all risks and rewards include repurchase transactions.
e. Oﬀ
 setting of ﬁ
 nancial assets and ﬁ
 nancial liabilities
Financial assets and fi
 nancial liabilities are oﬀ
 set and the net amount reported in the statement of fi
 nancial 
position when there is a legally enforceable right to oﬀ
 set the recognized amounts and there is an intention 
to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRSs, or for gains and 
losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Bank’s trading activity.
f. Fair value of ﬁ
 nancial assets and ﬁ
 nancial liabilities
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date, in the principal, or in its absence, the 
most advantageous market to which the Bank has access at that date.
g. Amortized cost measurement
The amortized cost of a fi
 nancial asset or liability is the amount at which the fi
 nancial asset or liability is 
measured at initial recognition, minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization 
using the eﬀ
 ective interest method of any diﬀ
 erence between the initial amount recognized and the maturity 
amount, minus any reduction for impairment.
2.6. Islamic banking
2.6.1. Murabaha
Murabaha is an Islamic fi
 nancing transaction which represents an agreement whereby the Bank buys 
a commodity/good and sells it to a counterparty (customer) based on a promise received from that 
counterparty to buy the commodity according to specifi
 c terms and conditions. The selling price comprises 
of the cost of the commodity/goods and a pre-agreed profi
 t margin.
It is treated as fi
 nancing receivables. Financing receivables are non-derivative fi
 nancial assets with fi
 xed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
The profi
 t is quantifi
 able and contractually determined at the commencement of the contract. Murabaha 
Income (profi
 t) is recognised as it accrues over the life of the contract using the eﬀ
 ective profi
 t method 
(EPRM) on the principal balance outstanding.
23
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
These products are carried at amortised cost less impairment.
2.7. Net interest income
2.7.1. Policy applicable from 1 July 2018
a.  Eﬀ
 ective interest rate and amortised cost
Interest income and expense are recognised in profi
 t or loss using the eﬀ
 ective interest method. The 
‘eﬀ
 ective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through 
the expected life of the fi
 nancial instrument to:
 
 The gross carrying amount of the fi
 nancial asset; or
 
 The amortised cost of the fi
 nancial liability.
When calculating the eﬀ
 ective interest rate for fi
 nancial instruments other than credit-impaired assets, 
the Bank estimates future cash ﬂ
 ows considering all contractual terms of the fi
 nancial instrument, but 
not expected credit losses. For credit-impaired fi
 nancial assets, a credit-adjusted eﬀ
 ective interest rate is 
calculated using estimated future cash ﬂ
 ows including expected credit losses.
The calculation of the eﬀ
 ective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees and points paid or received 
that are an integral part of the eﬀ
 ective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are 
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a fi
 nancial asset or fi
 nancial liability
b. Amortised cost and gross carrying amount
The ‘amortised cost’ of a fi
 nancial asset or fi
 nancial liability is the amount at which the fi
 nancial asset 
or fi
 nancial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the 
cumulative amortisation using the eﬀ
 ective interest method of any diﬀ
 erence between that initial amount 
and the maturity amount and, for fi
 nancial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance (or 
impairment allowance before 1 July 2018). 
The ‘gross carrying amount of a fi
 nancial asset’ is the amortised cost of a fi
 nancial asset before adjusting 
for any expected credit loss allowance.
c. Calculation of interest income and expense
In calculating interest income and expense, the eﬀ
 ective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying 
amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability.
However, for fi
 nancial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest 
income is calculated by applying the eﬀ
 ective interest rate to the amortised cost of the fi
 nancial asset. If 
the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.
For fi
 nancial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying 
the credit-adjusted eﬀ
 ective interest rate to the amortised cost of the asset. The calculation of interest 
income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves. 
d. Presentation
Interest income and expense presented in the statement of profi
 t or loss and OCI include:
 Interest on fi
 nancial assets and fi
 nancial liabilities measured at amortised cost calculated on an eﬀ
 ective 
interest basis;
 Interest on debt instruments measured at FVOCI calculated on an eﬀ
 ective interest basis;
 The eﬀ
 ective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivatives designated in cash ﬂ
 ow 
hedges of variability in interest cash ﬂ
 ows, in the same period as the hedged cash ﬂ
 ows aﬀ
 ect interest 
income/expense; and
The eﬀ
 ective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivatives designated in fair value 
hedges of interest rate risk.
Interest income and expense on all trading assets and liabilities are considered to be incidental to the 
Bank’s trading operations and are presented together with all other changes in the fair value of trading 
assets and liabilities in net trading income.

Interest income and expense on other fi
 nancial assets and fi
 nancial liabilities at FVTPL are presented in net 
income from other fi
 nancial instruments at FVTPL.
2.7.2. Policy applicable before 1 July 2018
Interest income and expense on available-for-sale assets and fi
 nancial assets or liabilities held at amortised 
cost was recognised in profi
 t or loss using the eﬀ
 ective interest method. 
When calculating the eﬀ
 ective interest rate, the Bank estimated the cash ﬂ
 ows considering all contractual 
terms of the fi
 nancial instrument but did not consider future credit losses.  The calculation included all fees 
and points paid or received, between the parties to the contract that were an integral part of the eﬀ
 ective 
interest rate, transaction costs and all other discounts and premiums.  Transaction costs were incremental 
costs that were directly attributable to the acquisitio, issue or disposal of a fi
 nancial asset or liability.
Once a fi
 nancial asset or a group of similar fi
 nancial assets had been written down as a result of an 
impairment loss, interest income was recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash 
ﬂ
 ows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
Interest income and expense on all trading assets and liabilities were considered to be incidental to the 
Bank’s trading operations are presented in net interest income.
2.8 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents’ include notes and coins on hand, unrestricted balances held with central Banks 
and highly liquid fi
 nancial assets with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition 
that are subject to an insignifi
 cant risk of changes in their fair value, and areused by the Bank in the 
management of its short-term commitments.
Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortised cost in the statement of fi
 nancial position.
2.9 Net trading income
Net trading income’ comprises gains less losses related to trading assets and liabilities, and includes all fair 
value changes, interest, dividends and foreign exchange diﬀ
 erences.
2.10 Property, plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses, 
if 
any. 
Such 
cost 
includes 
the 
cost 
of 
replacing 
part 
of 
the 
property, 
plant 
and 
equipment 
if 
the 
recognition 
criteria are met. When signifi
 cant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at 
intervals, the Bank recognises such parts as individual assets with specifi
 c useful lives and depreciates 
them accordingly. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in income statement as incurred.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefi
 ts associated with the item will ﬂ
 ow to 
the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part 
is derecognised. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost  to their 
residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
The Bank commences depreciation when the asset is available for use. Land is not depreciated. Capital 
work-in-progress is not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use.  They are disclosed when 
reclassifi
 ed during the year.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any signifi
 cant part initially recognised is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic benefi
 ts are expected from its use disposal. Any gain or loss arising on 
derecognition of the asset (calculated as the diﬀ
 erence between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset) is included in income statement when the asset is derecognised.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed 
at each fi
 nancial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
2.11 Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, 
if any. Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and 
the related expenditure is reﬂ
 ected in income statement in the period in which the expenditure is incurred .
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either fi
 nite or indefi
 nite. Intangible assets with 
fi
 nite lives are amortised over the useful economic life. The amortisation period and the amortisation 
method for an intangible asset with a fi
 nite useful life are reviewed at least at each fi
 nancial year-
end. Changes in the expected useful life, or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic 
benefi
 ts embodied in the asset, are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or methodology, 
as appropriate, which are then treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expenses 
on intangible assets with fi
 nite lives is presented as a separate line item in the income statement.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight–line method to write down the cost of intangible assets to their 
residual values over their estimated useful lives,which is 6 years.
2.12 Investment property
Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, are classifi
 ed as 
investment properties.
 
Recognition of investment properties takes place only when it is probable that the future economic benefi
 ts 
that are associated with the investment property will ﬂ
 ow to the Bank and the cost can be reliably measured. 
This is usually when all risks are transferred.
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. The Bank has opted to 
subsequently carry investment property at cost and disclose fair value. Fair value is based on comparative 
market prices, adjusted if necessary, for any diﬀ
 erence in the nature, location or condition of the specifi
 c 
asset. If this information is not available, the Bank uses alternative valuation methods, such as recent prices 
on less active markets or discounted cash ﬂ
 ow projections. Valuations are performed as of the reporting 
date by professional valuers who hold recognised and relevant professional qualifi
 cations and have recent 
experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued. These valuations form the 
basis for the carrying amounts in the fi
 nancial statements. 
The fair value of investment property reﬂ
 ects, the near current market conditions.

BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
The fair value of investment property does not reﬂ
 ect future capital expenditure that will improve or enhance 
the property and does not reﬂ
 ect the related future benefi
 ts from this future expenditure other than those a 
rational market participant would take into account when determining the value of the property.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised to the asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable that future 
economic benefi
 ts associated with the expenditure will ﬂ
 ow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be 
measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. When part of an 
investment property is replaced, the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
Investment properties are derecognised when they have been disposed. Where the Bank disposes of a 
property at fair value in an arm’s length transaction, the carrying value immediately prior to the sale is 
adjusted to the transaction price, and the adjustment is recorded in the statement of changes in net assets 
available for benefi
 t.   
2.13  Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and discontinued operations
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classifi
 ed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be 
recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered 
highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, 
except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefi
 ts, fi
 nancial assets and 
investment property that are carried at fair value and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which 
are specifi
 cally exempt from this requirement.
An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to 
fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell 
of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. 
A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) 
is recognised at the date of derecognition.
Non-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortised 
while they are classifi
 ed as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a 
disposal group classifi
 ed as held for sale continue to be recognised.
Non-current assets classifi
 ed as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classifi
 ed as held for 
sale are presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal 
group classifi
 ed as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the balance sheet.
A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classifi
 ed as held 
for sale and that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part 
of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary 
acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately 
in the statement of profi
 t or loss.
2.14 Impairment of non-ﬁ
 nancial assets
The Bank assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. 
If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Bank estimates the 
asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating 
unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.

When

the

is

and 
is

down 
to 
its 
recoverable 
amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂ
 ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reﬂ
 ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifi
 c to the 
asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no 
such 
transactions 
can 
be 
identifi
 ed, 
an 
appropriate 
valuation 
model 
is 
used. 
These

by 
valuation 
multiples, 
quoted

The Bank bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared 
separately for each of the Bank’s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and 
forecast calculations generally cover a period of fi
 ve years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is 
calculated and applied to project future cash ﬂ
 ows after the fi
 fth year.
For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there 
is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such 
indication exists, the Bank estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the 
asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that 
the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the 
asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the income statement.
2.15 Other assets
Other assets are generally defi
 ned as claims held against other entities for the future receipt of money. The 
other assets in the Bank’s fi
 nancial statements include the following:
(a) Prepayment
Prepayments are payments made in advance for services to be enjoyed in future. The amount is initially 
capitalized in the reporting period in which the payment is made and subsequently amortised over the 
period in which the service is to be enjoyed.
(b) Other receivables
Other receivables are recognised upon the occurrence of event or transaction as they arise and cancelled 
when payment is received.
The Bank’s other receivables are rent receivables and other receivables from debtors.
2.16 Fair value measurement
The Bank measures fi
 nancial instruments classifi
 ed as available-for-sale at fair value at each statement 
of fi
 nancial position date. Fair value related disclosures for fi
 nancial instruments and non-fi
 nancial assets 
that are measured at fair value or where fair values are disclosed are, summarised in the following notes:
• Disclosures for valuation methods, signifi
 cant estimates and assumptions Notes 3 and Note 4.7.1
• Quantitative disclosures of fair value measurement hierarchy Note 4.7.2
• Financial instruments (including those carried at amortised cost) Note 4.7.3
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based 
on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

• In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
• In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to by the Bank.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would 
use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
The Bank uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which suﬃ
  cient data 
are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the 
use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the fi
 nancial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is 
signifi
 cant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
• Level 1 —  Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is signifi
 cant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
• Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is signifi
 cant to the fair value 
measurement is  unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the fi
 nancial statements on a recurring basis, the Bank 
determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation 
(based on the lowest level input that is signifi
 cant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of 
each reporting period.
The Bank’s management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement, 
such as available-for-sale fi
 nancial assets.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Bank has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the 
basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy 
as explained above.
2.17 Employee beneﬁ
 ts
The Bank operates various post-employment schemes, including both defi
 ned benefi
 t and defi
 ned 
contribution pension plans and post employment benefi
 ts.
(a) Deﬁ
 ned contribution plan
The Bank operates two defi
 ned contribution plans;
i) pension scheme in line with the provisions of Ethiopian pension of private organisation employees 
proclamation 715/2011.  Funding under the scheme is 7% and 11% by employees and the Bank 
respectively;
ii) provident fund contribution, funding under this scheme is 6% and 12% by employees and the Bank 
respectively; based on the employees’ salary. Employer’s contributions to this scheme are charged to 
profi
 t or loss and other comprehensive income in the period in which they relate.
(b) Deﬁ
 ned beneﬁ
 t plan
The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defi
 ned benefi
 t pension plans is the
present value of the defi
 ned benefi
 t obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan 
assets. The defi
 ned benefi
 t obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected 
unit credit method.
29
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
The liability recognised in the statement of fi
 nancial position in respect of defi
 ned benefi
 t pension 
plans is the present value of the defi
 ned benefi
 t obligation at the end of the reporting period less 
the fair value of plan assets. The defi
 ned benefi
 t obligation is calculated annually by independent 
actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defi
 ned benefi
 t obligation 
is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outﬂ
 ows using interest rates of high-
quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefi
 ts will be paid, 
and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
The current service cost of the defi
 ned benefi
 t plan, recognised in the income statement in employee 
benefi
 t expense, except where included in the cost of an asset, reﬂ
 ects the increase in the defi
 ned benefi
 t 
obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefi
 t changes curtailments and settlements.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions 
are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
(c ) Termination beneﬁ
 ts
Termination benefi
 ts are payable to bank employees and executive directors when employment is terminated 
by the Bank before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in 
exchange for these benefi
 ts. The Bank recognises termination benefi
 ts when it is demonstrably committed 
to either: terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without 
possibility of withdrawal; or providing termination benefi
 ts as a result of an oﬀ
 er made to encourage 
voluntary redundancy.
(d ) Proﬁ
 t-sharing and bonus plans
The Banks recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profi
 t-sharing based on a formula that 
takes into consideration the profi
 t attributable to the company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. 
The Bank recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has 
created a constructive obligation.
2.18 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of 
a past event, it is probable that an outﬂ
 ow of resources embodying economic benefi
 ts will be required 
to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the 
Bank expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, 
the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually 
certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in income statement net of any reimbursement.
If the eﬀ
 ect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate 
that reﬂ
 ects, when appropriate, the risks specifi
 c to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in 
the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as other operating expenses.
2.19  Share capital
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options or to the acquisition of a 
business are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
2.20 Earnings per share
The Bank presents basic earnings per share for its ordinary shares.  Basic earnings per share are calculated 
30 |  Bank of Abyssinia S.C Annual Report 2018/19
2018/19 Annual Report
by dividing the profi
 t or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Bank by the weighted average 
number of shares outstanding during the period.
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
2.21 Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, is based on the substance of 
the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfi
 lment of the arrangement is dependent on 
the use of a specifi
 c asset or assets or whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
Bank as a lessee
Leases that do not transfer to the Bank substantially all of the risks and benefi
 ts incidental to ownership 
of the leased items are operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rental payable is recognised as 
an expense in the period in which they it is incurred.
Bank as a lessor
Leases where the Bank does not transfer substantially all of the risk and benefi
 ts of ownership of the asset 
are classifi
 ed as operating leases. Rental income is recorded as earned based on the contractual terms of 
the lease in Other operating income. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating operating leases are added 
to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental 
income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.
2.22 Income taxation
(a) Current income tax
The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable 
income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in 
deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary diﬀ
 erences and to unused tax losses.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted 
at the end of the reporting period in Ethiopia. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in 
tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It 
establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
(b) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary diﬀ
 erences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the fi
 nancial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities 
are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred tax is not accounted 
for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction aﬀ
 ects neither accounting nor taxable profi
 t or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the 
deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profi
 t will be 
available against which the temporary diﬀ
 erences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are oﬀ
 set when there is a legally enforceable right to oﬀ
 set current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or diﬀ
 erent taxable entities where 
there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only oﬀ
 set when they arise in the same tax reporting group and where 
there is both the legal right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously.

3. Signiﬁ
 cant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Bank’s fi
 nancial statements requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that aﬀ
 ect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and 
liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. 
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a 
material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities aﬀ
 ected in future periods.
Other disclosures relating to the Bank’s exposure to risks and uncertainties includes:
 Capital management Note 4.6
 Financial risk management and policies Note 4.1
 Sensitivity analyses disclosures Note 4.5.2
3.1 Judgements
In the process of applying the Bank’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, 
which have the most signifi
 cant eﬀ
 ect on the amounts recognised in the fi
 nancial statements:
Operating lease commitments - Bank as lessee
The Bank has entered into commercial property leases. The Bank has determined, based on an evaluation 
of the terms and conditions of the arrangements, such as the lease term not constituting a substantial 
portion of the economic life of the commercial property, that it does not retain all the signifi
 cant risks and 
rewards of ownership of these properties and accounts for the contracts as operating leases.
3.2 Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation at the reporting date, that 
have a signifi
 cant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next fi
 nancial year, are described below. The Bank based its assumptions and estimates on 
parameters available when the fi
 nancial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions 
about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances beyond the 
control of the Bank. Such changes are reﬂ
 ected in the assumptions when they occur.
Deﬁ
 ned beneﬁ
 t plans
The cost of the defi
 ned benefi
 t pension plan, long service awards, gratuity scheme and post-employment 
medical benefi
 ts and the present value of these defi
 ned benefi
 t obligations are determined using actuarial 
valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may diﬀ
 er from actual 
developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases, 
mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its 
long-term nature, a defi
 ned benefi
 t obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All 
assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
Depreciation and carrying value of property, plant and equipment
The estimation of the useful lives of assets is based on management’s judgement. Any material adjustment 
to the estimated useful lives of items of property and equipment will have an impact on the carrying value 
of these items.
Impairment of non-ﬁ
 nancial assets
Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable 
amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The fair value less 
costs of disposal calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions, conducted at arm’s 
length, for similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The 
value in use calculation is based on a DCF model. The cash ﬂ
 ows are derived from the budget for the next 
fi
 ve years and do not include restructuring activities that the Bank is not yet

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

committed to or signifi
 cant future investments that will enhance the asset’s performance of the CGU being 
tested. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash ﬂ
 ow model as 
well as the expected future cash-inﬂ
 ows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes.
 
Taxes
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax 
laws, and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international 
business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, 
diﬀ
 erences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such 
assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. The 
amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and 
diﬀ
 ering interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profi
 t 
will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Signifi
 cant management judgement is required to 
determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the 
level of future taxable profi
 ts together with future tax planning strategies.
Development cost 
The Bank capitalises development costs for a project in accordance with the accounting policy. 
Initial capitalisation of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and economic 
feasibility is confi
 rmed, usually when a product development project has reached a defi
 ned milestone 
according to an established project management model. In determining the amounts to be capitalised, 
management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, 
discount rates to be applied and the expected period of benefi
 ts. The development costs that 
were capitalised by the Bank relates to those arising from the development of computer software.

4 Financial risk management
4.1 Introduction
Risk is inherent in the Bank’s activities, but is managed through a process of ongoing identifi
 cation, 
measurement and monitoring, subject to risk limits and other controls. This process of risk management is 
critical to the Bank’s continuing profi
 tability and each individual within the Bank is accountable for the risk 
exposures relating to his or her responsibilities. The Bank is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk and market 
risk. It is also subject to country risk and various operating risks.
The independent risk control process does not include business risks such as changes in the environment, 
technology and industry. The Bank’s policy is to monitor those business risks through the Bank’s strategic 
planning process.
4.1.1 Risk management structure
The Asset-Liability Management Committee, is responsible for the overall risk management approach and 
for approving the risk management strategies and principles. It also has the responsibility to monitor the 
overall risk process within the Bank.
The Asset-Liability Management Committee has the overall responsibility for the development of the risk 
strategy and implementing principles, frameworks, policies and limits. It is also responsible for managing 
risk decisions and monitoring risk levels and reports on a monthly basis to the Board risk committee.
The Credit Risk Management Committee is responsible for implementing and maintaining risk related 
procedures to ensure an independent control process is maintained. The unit works closely with the 
Management Risk Committee to ensure that procedures are compliant with the overall framework.
The Risk Management Unit is responsible for monitoring compliance with risk principles, policies and 
limits across the Bank. It carries out an assessment of risk on an ad hoc basis to  monitor the Bank’s 
independent control of risks, including monitoring the risk of exposures against limits and the assessment 
of risks of new products and structured transactions. This unit also ensures the complete capture of the 
risks in risk measurement and reporting systems. Exceptions are reported, where necessary, to the Risk 
Management Committee, and further to the Board Risk Committee and the relevant actions are taken to 
address exceptions and any areas of weakness.
Bank Treasury operation is responsible for managing the Bank’s fi
 nancial assets, fi
 nancial liabilities and the 
overall fi
 nancial structure. It is also primarily responsible for the funding and liquidity risks of the Bank.
The Bank’s policy is that risk management processes throughout the Bank are audited annually by the 
Internal Audit function, which examines both the adequacy of the procedures and the Bank’s compliance 
with the procedures. Internal Audit Function discusses the results of all assessments with management, 
and reports its fi
 ndings and recommendations to the Board Audit Committee.
4.1.2 Risk measurement and reporting systems
The Bank’s risks are measured using a method that reﬂ
 ects both the expected loss likely to arise in normal 
circumstances and unexpected losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss based on statistical 
models. The models make use of probabilities derived from historical experience, adjusted to reﬂ
 ect the 
economic environment. The Bank also runs worst-case scenarios that would arise in the event that extreme 
events which are unlikely to occur do, in fact, occur.
Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily performed based on limits established by the Bank. These 
limits reﬂ
 ect the business strategy and market environment of the Bank as well as the level of risk that the 
Bank is willing to accept, with additional emphasis on selected regions. In addition, the Bank’s policy is to 
measure and monitor the overall risk bearing capacity in relation to the aggregate risk exposure across all 
risk types and activities.

4.1.3 Risk mitigation
Risk controls and mitigants, identifi
 ed and approved for the Bank, are documented for existing and new 
processes and systems.
The adequacy of these mitigants is tested on a periodic basis through administration of control self-
assessment questionnaires, using an operational risk management tool which requires risk owners to 
confi
 rm the eﬀ
 ectiveness of established controls. These are subsequently audited as part of the review 
process.
4.2 Financial instruments by category 
The Bank’s fi
 nancial assets are classifi
 ed into the following measurement categories: available-for-sale and 
loans and receivables and the fi
 nancial liabilities are classifi
 ed into other liabilities at amortised cost.
Financial instruments are classifi
 ed in the statement of fi
 nancial position in accordance with their legal form 
and substance.

4.3.Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of fi
 nancial loss to the Bank if a customer or counterparty to a fi
 nancial instrument fails 
to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Bank’s loans and advances to customers 
and other banks and other fi
 nancial assets.
Exposure to credit risk is managed through periodic analysis of the ability of borrowers and potential 
borrowers to determine their capacity to meet principal and interest thereon, and restructuring such limits 
as appropriate. Exposure to credit risk is also mitigated, in part, by obtaining collateral, commercial and 
personal guarantees.
The Bank structures the levels of credit risk it undertakes by placing limits on the amount of risk accepted 
in relation to one borrower, or groups of borrowers, and to term of the fi
 nancial instrument and economic 
sectors.
The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) sets credit risk limit for a single borrower, one related party and 
all related parties to not exceed 25%, 15% and 35% of Bank’s total capital amount as of the reporting 
quarterly period respectively.
Credit management is conducted as per the risk management policy and guideline approved by the board 
of directors and the Risk Management Committees. Such policies are reviewed and modifi
 ed periodically 
based on changes and expectations of the markets where the Bank operates, regulations, and other factors.
4.3.1.Credit quality analysis
The following table sets out information about the credit quality of fi
 nancial assets measured at amortised 
cost, FVOCI debt investments (2019) and available-for-sale debt assets (2018). Unless specifi
 cally indicated, 
for fi
 nancial assets, the amounts in the table represent gross carrying amounts. 
The loss allowance for loans and advances to customers also includes the loss allowances for loan com-
mitments and fi
 nancial guarantee contracts.

i)  Loans and advances to corporate customers
The general creditworthiness of a corporate customer tends to be the most relevant indicator of credit 
quality of a loan extended to it. However, collateral provides additional security and the Bank gener-
ally requests that corporate borrowers provide it. The Bank may take collateral in the form of a fi
 rst 
charge over real estate, ﬂ
 oating charges over all corporate assets and other liens and guarantees.
Because of the Bank’s focus on corporate customers’ creditworthiness, the Bank does not routinely 
update the valuation of collateral held against all loans to corporate customers. Valuation of collateral 
is updated when the loan is put on a watch list and the loan is monitored more closely. For credit-
impaired loans, the Bank obtains appraisals of collateral because it provides input into determining 
the management credit risk actions.
ii)  Investment securities designated as at FVTPL
At 30 June 2019, the Bank had no exposure to credit risk of the investment securities designated as 
at FVTPL

4.3.3. Amounts arising from ECL
i) Inputs, assumptions and techniques used for estimating impairment
See accounting policy in Note 2.5.1.(c)
ii) Signiﬁ
 cant increase in credit risk
When determining whether the risk of default on a fi
 nancial instrument has increased signifi
 cantly since 
initial recognition, the Bank considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available 
without undue cost or eﬀ
 ort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based 
on the Bank’s historical experience and expert credit assessment and including forward-looking information.
The objective of the assessment is to identify whether a signifi
 cant increase in credit risk has occurred 
for an exposure by comparing:
  the remaining lifetime probability of default (PD) as at the reporting date; with
  the remaining lifetime PD for this point in time that was estimated at the time of initial recognition 
      of the exposure (adjusted where relevant for changes in prepayment expectations).
  the Bank uses three criteria for determining whether there has been a signifi
 cant increase in 
      credit risk:
  quantitative test based on movement in PD;
  qualitative indicators; and
  a backstop of 30 days past due,
iii)    Credit risk grades
The Bank allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on a variety of data that is determined 
to be predictive of the risk of default and applying experienced credit judgement. Credit risk grades 
are defi
 ned using qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of risk of default. These factors 
vary depending on the nature of the exposure and the type of borrower.
Credit risk grades are defi
 ned and calibrated such that the risk of default occurring increases 
exponentially as the credit risk deteriorates so, for example, the diﬀ
 erence in risk of default between 
credit risk grades 1 and 2 is smaller than the diﬀ
 erence between credit risk grades 2 and 3.Each 
exposure is allocated to a credit risk grade on initial recognition based on available information about 
the borrower. Exposures are subject to ongoing monitoring, which may result in an exposure being 
moved to a diﬀ
 erent credit risk grade. The monitoring typically involves use of the following data;
a. Term loan exposures
  Information obtained during periodic review of customer fi
 les – e.g. audited fi
 nancial statements, 
management accounts, budgets and projections. Examples of areas of particular focus are: gross 
profi
 t margins, fi
 nancial leverage ratios, debt service coverage, compliance
   Data from credit reference agencies, press articles, changes in external credit ratings
   Actual and expected signifi
 cant changes in the political, regulatory and technological environment 
of the borrower or in its business activities
   Internally collected data on customer behaviour – e.g. utilisation of credit card facilities
   Aﬀ
 ordability metrics
b.  Overdraft exposures
   Payment record – this includes overdue status as well as a range of variables about payment ratios
   Utilisation of the granted limit
   Requests for and granting of forbearance
   Existing and forecast changes in business, fi
 nancial and economic conditions

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
iv)  Generating the term structure of PD
Credit risk grades are a primary input into the determination of the term structure of PD for exposures. 
The Bank collects performance and default information about its credit risk exposures analysed by type 
of product and borrower as well as by credit risk grading. The Bank employs statistical models to analyse 
the data collected and generate estimates of the remaining lifetime PD of exposures and how these are 
expected to change as a result of the passage of time.
v)  Determining whether credit risk has increased signiﬁ
 cantly
The Bank assesses whether credit risk has increased signifi
 cantly since initial recognition at each reporting 
date. Determining whether an increase in credit risk is signifi
 cant depends on the characteristics of the 
fi
 nancial instrument and the borrower. What isconsidered signifi
 cant diﬀ
 ers for diﬀ
 erent types of lending.
The credit risk may also be deemed to have increased signifi
 cantly since initial recognition based on 
qualitative factors linked to the Bank’s credit risk management processes that may not otherwise be fully 
reﬂ
 ected in its quantitative analysis on a timely basis. This will be the case for exposures that meet certain 
heightened risk criteria, such as placement on a watch list. Such qualitative factors are based on its expert 
judgment and relevant historical experiences.
As a backstop, the Bank considers that a signifi
 cant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when an 
asset is more than 30 days past due. Days past due are determined by counting the number of days 
since the earliest elapsed due date in respect of which full payment has not been received. Due dates are 
determined without considering any grace period that might be available to the borrower.
If there is evidence that there is no longer a signifi
 cant increase in credit risk relative to initial recognition, 
then the loss allowance on an instrument returns to being measured as 12-month ECL. Some qualitative 
indicators of an increase in credit risk, such as delinquency or forbearance, may be indicative of an increased 
risk of default that persists after the indicator itself has ceased to exist. In these cases, the Bank determines 
a probation period during which the fi
 nancial asset is required to demonstrate good behaviour to provide 
evidence that its credit risk has declined suﬃ
  ciently. When contractual terms of a loan have been modifi
 ed, 
evidence that the criteria for recognising lifetime ECL are no longer met includes a history of up-to-date 
payment performance against the modifi
 ed contractual terms. 
The Bank monitors the eﬀ
 ectiveness of the criteria used to identify signifi
 cant increases in credit risk by 
regular reviews to confi
 rm that:
 the criteria are capable of identifying signifi
 cant increases in credit risk before an exposure is in default;
 the criteria do not align with the point in time when an asset becomes 30 days past due;
 the average time between the identifi
 cation of a signifi
 cant increase in credit risk and default appears  
  reasonable;
 exposures are not generally transferred directly from 12-month ECL measurement to credit- impaired; and
 there is no unwarranted volatility in loss allowance from transfers between 12-month PD (Stage 1) and 
lifetime PD (Stage 2).
vi)  Deﬁ
 nition of default
The Bank considers a fi
 nancial asset to be in default when:
 the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank in full, without recourse by the Bank to  
  actions such as realising security (if any is held);
 the borrower is more than 90 days past due on any material credit obligation to the Bank.
 Overdrafts are considered as being past due once the customer has breached an advised limit or been 
  advised of a limit smaller than the current amount outstanding; or
 it is becoming probable that the borrower will restructure the asset as a result of bankruptcy due to the 
  borrower’s inability to pay its credit obligations.
  In assessing whether a borrower is in default, the Bank considers indicators that are:
 qualitative: e.g. breaches of covenant;
 quantitative: e.g. overdue status and non-payment on another obligation of the same issuer to the   
  Bank; and

 based on data developed internally and obtained from external sources.
 Inputs into the assessment of whether a fi
 nancial instrument is in default and their signifi
 cance may vary   
  over time to reﬂ
 ect changes in circumstances.
 The defi
 nition of default largely aligns with that applied by the Bank for regulatory capital purposes 
vii) Incorporation of forward-looking information
The Bank incorporates forward-looking information into both the assessment of whether the credit risk of 
an instrument has increased signifi
 cantly since its initial recognition and the measurement of ECL.
For each segment, the Bank formulates three economic scenarios: a base case, which is the median 
scenario, and two less likely scenarios, one upside and one downside. For each sector, the base case is 
aligned with the macroeconomic model’s information value output, a measure of the predictive power of 
the model, as well as base macroeconomic projections for identifi
 ed macroeconomic variables for each 
sector. The upside and downside scenarios are based on a combination of a percentage error factor of 
each sector model as well as simulated optimistic and pessimistic macroeconomic projections based on a 
measure of historical macroeconomic volatilities.
External information considered includes economic data and forecasts published by Business Monitor 
International, an external and independent macroeconomic data body. This is in addition to industry – level, 
semi – annual NPL trends across statistically comparable sectors.
Periodically, the Bank carries out stress testing of more extreme shocks to calibrate its determination of the 
upside and downside representative scenarios. A comprehensive review is performed at least annually on 
the design of the scenarios by a panel of experts that advises the Bank’s senior management.
The Bank has identifi
 ed and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for each portfolio of 
fi
 nancial instruments and, using an analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between macro-
economic variables and credit risk and credit losses.
The key drivers for credit risk for each of the Bank’s economic sectors is summarized below:.

Predicted relationships between the key indicators and default rates on various portfolios of fi
 nancial assets have been 
developed based on analysing semi – annual historical data over the past 5 years. 
viii) Modiﬁ
 ed ﬁ
 nancial assets
The contractual terms of a loan may be modifi
 ed for a number of reasons, including changing market 
conditions, customer retention and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of 
the customer. An existing loan whose terms have been modifi
 ed may be derecognised and the renegotiated 
loan recognised as a new loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy set out.
When the terms of a fi
 nancial asset are modifi
 ed and the modifi
 cation does not result in derecognition, 
the determination of whether the asset’s credit risk has increased signifi
 cantly reﬂ
 ects comparison of: its 
remaining lifetime PD at the reporting date based on the modifi
 ed terms; withthe remaining lifetime PD 
estimated based on data on initial recognition and the original contractual terms.
When modifi
 cation results in derecognition, a new loan is recognised and allocated to Stage 1 (assuming it 
is not credit-impaired at that time).
The Bank renegotiates loans to customers in fi
 nancial diﬃ
  culties (referred to as ‘forbearance activities’) to 
maximise collection opportunities and minimise the risk of default. Under the Bank’s forbearance policy, 
loan forbearance is granted on a selective basis if the debtor is currently in default on its debt or if there is 
a high risk of default, there is evidence that the debtor made all reasonable eﬀ
 orts to pay under the original 
contractual terms and the debtor is expected to be able to meet the revised terms.
The revised terms usually include extending the maturity, changing the timing of interest payments and 
amending the terms of loan covenants. Both retail and corporate loans are subject to the forbearance 
policy. The Bank Credit Committee regularly reviews reports on forbearance activities.
For fi
 nancial assets modifi
 ed as part of the Bank’s forbearance policy, the estimate of PD reﬂ
 ects whether 
the modifi
 cation has improved or restored the Bank’s ability to collect interest and principal and the Bank’s 
previous experience of similar forbearance action. As part of this process, the Bank evaluates the borrower’s 
payment performance against the modifi
 ed contractual terms and considers various behavioural indicators.
Generally, forbearance is a qualitative indicator of a signifi
 cant increase in credit risk and an expectation of 
forbearance may constitute evidence that an exposure is credit-impaired. A customer needs to demonstrate 
consistently good payment behaviour over a period of time before the exposure is no longer considered to 
be credit-impaired/in default or the PD is considered to have decreased such that the loss allowance reverts 
to being measured at an amount equal to Stage 1.

BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
ix) Measurement of ECL
The key inputs into the measurement of ECL are the term structure of the following variables:
-  probability of default (PD);
-  loss given default (LGD); and
-  exposure at default (EAD).
ECL for exposures in Stage 1 is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD by LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL 
is calculated by multiplying the lifetime PD by LGD and EAD.
The methodology of estimating PDs is discussed above under the heading ‘Generating the term structure of 
PD’. LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Bank estimates LGD parameters based 
on the history of recovery rates of claims against defaulted counterparties. The LGD models consider the 
structure, collateral, seniority of the claim, counterparty industry and recoverycosts of any collateral that is 
integral to the fi
 nancial asset. 
EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Bank derives the EAD from the current 
exposure to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract and 
arising from amortisation. The EAD of a fi
 nancial asset is its gross carrying amount at the time of default. For 
lending commitments, the EADs are potential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which 
are estimated based on historical observationsand forward-looking forecasts. For fi
 nancial guarantees, the 
EAD represents the amount of the guaranteed exposure when the fi
 nancial guarantee becomes payable. 
For some fi
 nancial assets, EAD is determined by modelling the range of possible exposure outcomes at 
various points in time using scenario and statistical techniques.
As described above, and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for Stage 1 fi
 nancial assets, the 
Bank measures ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period (including any 
borrower’s extension options) over which it is exposed to credit risk, even if, for credit risk management 
purposes, the Bank considers a longer period. 
The maximum contractual period extends to the date at which the Bank has the right to require repayment 
of an advance or terminate a loan commitment or guarantee.
However, for overdrafts that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment component, the Bank 
measures ECL over a period longer than the maximum contractual period if the Bank’s contractual ability 
to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the Bank’s exposure to credit 
losses to the contractual notice period. These facilities do not have a fi
 xed term or repayment structure and 
are managed on a collective basis. The Bank can cancel them with immediate eﬀ
 ect but this contractual 
right is not enforced in the normal day-to-day management, but only when the Bank becomes aware of 
an increasein credit risk at the facility level. This longer period is estimated taking into account the credit 
risk management actions that the Bank expects to take, and that serve to mitigate ECL. These include a 
reduction in limits, cancellation of the facility and/or turning the outstanding balance into a loan with fi
 xed 
repayment terms. 
Where modelling of a parameter is carried out on a collective basis, the fi
 nancial instruments are grouped 
on the basis of shared risk characteristics that include:
-  instrument type;
-  credit risk grading;
-  collateral type;
-  LTV ratio for retail mortgages;
-  date of initial recognition;
-  remaining term to maturity;
-  industry; and
-  geographic location of the borrower.
The groupings are subject to regular review to ensure that exposures within a particular group remain 
appropriately homogeneous.
x) Loss allowance

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
Loans with renegotiated terms
Loans with renegotiated terms are defi
 ned as loans that have been restructured due to a deterioration 
in the borrower’s fi
 nancial position, for which the Bank has made concessions by agreeing to terms and 
conditions that are more favourable for the borrower than the Bank had provided initially and that it would 
not otherwise consider. A loan continues to be presented as part of loans with renegotiated terms until 
maturity, early repayment or write-oﬀ
 .
Loans that were past due but not impaired
Loans that were ‘past due but not impaired’ are those for which contractual interest or principal payments 
were past due but the Bank believed that impairment was not appropriate on the basis of the level of 
security or collateral available and/or the stageof collection of amounts owed to the Bank. The amounts 
disclosed exclude assets measured at FVTPL.
4.3.5. Concentrations of credit risk
The Bank monitors concentrations of credit risk by social sector. An analysis of concentrations of credit risk

The Bank’s accounting policies on the classifi

 nancial instruments under IFRS 9 are set out in Note 
2.5. The application of these policies resulted in the reclassifi
 cations set out in the table above and explained 
below.
On the adoption of IFRS 9, certain fi
 nancial assets such as cash and cash equivalents, loans and advances to 
customers – both interest bearing and interest free and treasury bills and bonds (NBE bills and government 
bonds) were reclassifi
 ed out of the loans and receivable to amortized cost. The carrying amount of those 
assets wasadjusted so that their amortised cost under IFRS 9 was as if those assets were accounted for at 
amortised cost from their inception.
Further equity investment securities were reclassifi
 ed out available-for-sale categories to FVOCI at their 
then fair values. The carrying amount of those assets was adjusted so that their amortised cost under IFRS 
9 was as if those assets were accounted for at amortised cost from their inception.
On the adoption of IFRS 9, other fi
 nancial assets suchaccounts receivables, uncleared eﬀ
 ects – both 
local and foreign and guarantee for overseas employment agencies were reclassifi
 ed out of the loans and 
receivable to amortized cost. The carrying amount of those assets was adjusted so that their amortised cost 
under IFRS 9 was as if those assets were accounted for at amortised cost from their inception.

4.4.2 Collateral held and their ﬁ
 nancial eﬀ
 ect
The general creditworthiness of a customer tends to be the most relevant indicator of credit quality of 
a loan extended to it. However, collateral provides additional security and the Bank generally requests 
that corporate borrowers provide it. Staﬀ
  loans are secured to the extent of the employee’s continued 
employment in the Bank.
The Bank may take collateral in the form of a fi
 rst charge over real estate, liens and guarantees. The Bank 
does not sell or repledge the collateral in the absence of default by the owner of the collateral. In addition 
to the Bank’s focus on creditworthiness, the Bank aligns with its credit policy guide to periodically update 
the validation of collaterals held against all loans to customers.
 
For impaired loans, the Bank obtains appraisals of collateral because the fair value of the collateral is an 
input to the impairment measurement.
The fair value of the collaterals are based on the last revaluations carried out by the Bank’s in-house 
engineers. The valuation technique adopted for properties is in line with the Bank’s  valuation manual and 
the revalued amount is similar to fair values of properties with similar size and location.
The fair value of collaterals other than properties such as share certifi
 cates, cash, NBE bills etc.  as disclosed 
at the carrying amount as management is of the opinion that the cost of the process of establishing the fair 
value of the collateral exceeds benefi
 ts accruable from the exercise. 
4.5. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that  the Bank cannot meet its maturing obligations when they become due, at 
reasonable cost and in a timely manner. Liquidity risk arises because of the possibility that the Bank might 
be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due as a result of mismatches in the timing of the 
cash ﬂ
 ows under both normal and stress circumstances. Such scenarios could occur when funding needed 
for illiquid asset positions is not available to the Bank on acceptable terms.
47
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
Liquidity risk management in the Bank is solely determined by Asset-Liability Management Committee, which 
bears the overall responsibility for liquidity risk. The main objective of the Bank’s liquidity risk framework is 
to maintain suﬃ
  cient liquidity in order to ensure that we meet our maturing obligations.
4.5.1 Management of liquidity risk
Cash ﬂ
 ow forecasting is performed by the fi
 nance department. The fi
 nance department monitors rolling 
forecasts of liquidity requirements to ensure it has suﬃ
  cient cash to meet operational needs. 
The Bank has incurred indebtedness in the form of borrowings. The Bank evaluates its ability to meet its 
obligations on an ongoing basis. Based on these evaluations, the Bank devises strategies to manage its 
liquidity risk.
Prudent liquidity risk management implies that suﬃ
  cient cash is maintained and that suﬃ
  cient funding is 
available to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring 
unacceptable losses or risk damage to the Bank’s reputation. 
4.5.2 Maturity analysis of ﬁ
 nancial liabilities
The table below analyses the Bank’s fi
 nancial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the 
remaining period at the statement of fi
 nancial position date to the contractual maturity date. The cash ﬂ
 ows 
presented are the undiscounted amounts to be settled in future.

fi
 nancial instrument will ﬂ
 uctuate because of changes in market risk factors  such as interest 
rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads and their volatilities. Market risk 
can arise in conjunction with trading and non-trading activities of a fi
 nancial institutions. 
The Bank does not ordinarily engage in trading activities as there are no active markets in Ethiopia.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
4.6.1. Management of market risk
The main objective of Market Risk Management is to manage and control market risk exposures within 
acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
4.6.2.Management of market risk
Market risk is monitored by the risk management department on regularly, to identify any adverse movement 
in the underlying variables.
(i) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a fi
 nancial instrument will be aﬀ
 ected by changes 
in market interest rates. Borrowings obtained at variable rates give rise to interest rate risk. 
The Bank’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Bank’s obligations 
and fi
 nancial assets with ﬂ
 oating interest rates. The Bank is also exposed on fi
 xed rate fi
 nancial assets and 
fi
 nancial liabilities. The Bank’s investment portfolio is comprised of treasury bills, loans and receivables and 
cash deposits.

(ii) Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂ
 ows of a fi
 nancial instrument will 
ﬂ
 uctuate due to the changes in foreign exchange rates.
 
The Bank is exposed to exchange rate risks to the extent of balances and transactions denominated in a 
currency other than the Ethiopian Birr. The Bank’s foreign currency bank accounts act as a natural hedge 
for these transactions. Management has set up a policy  to manage the Bank’s foreign exchange risk against 
its functional currency.
The table below summarises the impact of increases/decreases of 10% on equity and profi
 t 
or loss arising from the Bank’s foreign denominated borrowings and cash and bank balances.
The total foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities exposed to risk as at year end was Birr 220.33 
million as fcy liability (30 June 2018: Birr 55.58 million).

4.7 Capital management
The Bank’s objectives when managing capital are to comply with the capital requirements set by the 
National Bank of Ethiopia, safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, and to maintain a strong 
capital base  so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confi
 dence and to sustain future development 
of the business.  
4.7.1. Capital adequacy ratio
The capital adequacy ratio is the quotient of the capital base of the Bank and the Bank’s risk weighted asset 
base. The Bank’s capital is divided into two tiers:
- Tier 1 capital  includes share capital, retained earnings and deductions for intangible assets, and 
other regulatory adjustments relating to items that are included in equity but are treated diﬀ
 erently for 
capital adequacy purposes. Regulatory risk reserve is not recognised as a component of qualifying capital . 
However, any balance, should be netted oﬀ
  against the total risk weighted assets (RWA).
- Tier 2 capital  includes  qualifying subordinated liabilities and certain provisions for loan losses that are 
presently unidentifi
 ed on an individual basis.

4.8 Fair value of ﬁ
 nancial assets and liabilities
IFRS 13 requires an entity to classify measured or disclosed fair values according to a hierarchy that reﬂ
 ects 
the signifi
 cance of observable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the fi
 nancial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, which comprises of three levels as described below, based on 
the lowest level input that is signifi
 cant to the fair value measurement as a whole.
4.8.1. Valuation models
IFRS 13 specifi
 es a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those 
valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable input reﬂ
 ect market data 
obtained from independent sources; unobservable inputs reﬂ
 ect the Bank’s market assumptions.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the fi
 nancial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is 
signifi
 cant to the fair value measurement as a whole.
● Level 1: Inputs that are quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets 
   or liabilities.
● Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset 
 
or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) .This category includes 
instruments valued using: quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for 
identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active, or other valuation technique 
in which all signifi
 cant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data.
In conclusion, this category is for valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is signifi
 cant to 
the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
● Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable 
inputs). This category includes all assets and liabilities for which the valuation technique includes inputs not 
based on observable date and the unobservable inputs have a signifi
 cant eﬀ
 ect on the asset or liability’s 
valuation. This category includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments 
for which signifi
 cant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reﬂ
 ect diﬀ
 erences between 
the instruments.
4.8.2. Financial instruments not measured at fair value - Fair value hierarchy
The following table summarises the carrying amounts of fi
 nancial assets and liabilities at the reporting date 
by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised. The amounts 
are based on the values recognised in the statement of fi
 nancial position.

21b Fair value measurement of the Bank's Investment properties
The Bank's investment property is measured at cost. These properties include those held for rental purposes and 
those in which the Bank occupies an insignifi
 cant portion. These properties are held to earn rentals  and for capital 
appreciation. There are currently no restrictions on the realisability of these properties.
Investment property is initially measured at cost including transaction costs and subsequently measured at 
depreciated cost (less any accumulated impairment losses). Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line 
method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives of 50 years.

2018/19 Annual Report
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
The fair value of investment properties  has been disclosed as required.
The fair value of the Bank's Investment property as at June 30,2016 and has been arrived at by in-house engineers 
qualifi
 ed estate surveyors and reviewed and approved by independent valuers. These valuers have appropriate 
qualifi
 cations and recent experience in the valuation of properties in the relevant locations. 
The fair value was determined based on the replacement cost concept which approximates the estimated amount for 
which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length 
transaction after proper marketing, prudently and without compulsion. 
This implies a market comparable approach that reﬂ
 ects the recent transaction prices for similar properties). In 
estimating the fair value of the properties, the highest and best use of the properties is their current use. There has 
been no change to the valuation technique during the year.

Withdrawal from Service
The withdrawal rates are believed to be reasonably representative of the Ethiopian experience. The valuation assumed a 
rate of withdrawal of 10% at the youngest ages falling with increasing age to 2.5% at age 44.
The sensitivity of the overall defi
 ned benefi
 t liability to changes in the weighted principal assumption is:

Mortality experience
The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In prac-
tice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity 
of the defi
 ned benefi
 t obligation to signifi
 cant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defi
 ned benefi
 t 
obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when 
calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of fi
 nancial position.
There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior years. The aver-
age duration of the severance pay plan at the end of the reporting period is 2.78 years

The Regulatory risk reserve is a non-distributable reserves required by the regulations of the National Bank of 
Ethiopia(NBE) to be kept for impairment losses on loans and receivables in excess of IFRS charge as derived using 
the incurred loss model.
Where the loan loss impairment determined using the  National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) guidelines is higher than 
the loan loss impairment determined using the incurred loss model under IFRS, the diﬀ
 erence is transferred to 
regulatory risk reserve and it is non-distributable to the owners of the Bank.
Where the loan loss impairment determined using the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) guidelines is less than the 
loan loss impairment determined using the incurred loss model under IFRS, the diﬀ
 erence is transferred from 
regulatory risk reserve to the retained earning to the extent of the non-distributable reserve previously recognised.
Where the 70% of suspended interest income kept under this regulatory reserve account until the regulatory 
organs(NBE) amended the directive related with provision.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
36
Contingent liabilities
36a Claims and litigation
The Bank is a party to numerous legal actions brought by diﬀ
 erent organizations and individuals arising from 
its normal business operations. The maximum exposure of the Bank to these legal cases as at 30 June 2019 
is Birr 2.2 million (30 June 2017: Birr 6.7 million). No provision has been made in the fi
 nancial statements as 
the Directors believe that it is not probable that the economic benefi
 ts would ﬂ
 ow out of the Bank in respect 
of these legal actions.
36b Guarantees and letters of credit
"The Bank conducts business involving performance bonds and guarantees. These instruments are given as 
a security to support the performance of a customer to third parties. As the Bank will only be required to
meet these obligations in the event of the customer's default, the cash requirements of these instruments 
are expected to be considerably below their nominal amounts.
The table below summarises the fair value amount of contingent liabilities for the account of customers:"
