We expect Ethiopia’s macroeconomic conditions in 2021 will be shaped largely by 
developments in six key areas: covid, conflict, crops, credit, creditors, and currency.              
More specifically, how a number of questions surrounding these ‘six Cs’ are resolved 
(see below) will determine how well the overall economy fares in the year ahead. We 
offer our views in each of the six areas, including where we are mostly optimistic, 
where we are more uncertain, and where we see potentially emerging macro risks. 
Based on the above assessment, and a set of assumptions that we take to be a 
reasonable baseline, we also present our latest Quarterly Macro Review and economic 
forecasts—covering the real, monetary, fiscal, and external sectors—for 2021 & 2022. 
 
1. Covid: Is the economy recovering from the covid pandemic?  
2. Conflict: Will the recent conflict have material macroeconomic impacts? 
3. Crops: Is the crop harvest this year turning out to be a boom or a bust? 
4. Credit: Are banks and businesses facing a credit crunch? 
5. Creditors: Are relations with foreign creditors souring or strengthening? 
6. Currency: How far and how fast will the currency move? 
 
To summarize our views, we are broadly optimistic that trends with respect to covid, 
credit, creditor relations, and the currency are moving in a positive direction, find 
greater-than-usual uncertainty on the outlook for crops, and see some possibly 
emerging macro risks linked to the recent conflict.  Reflecting this mixed backdrop, we 
expect Ethiopia’s macroeconomic environment will show 4 percent GDP growth this 
fiscal year (somewhat worse than recent years), 13 percent inflation (better than recent 
norms), 24 percent credit growth (largely in line), a modest budget deficit (near 3% of 
GDP), a stable debt ratio (unchanged at 52% of GDP), a slower pace of depreciation 
(unlikely to exceed 15 percent by year-end), and a gradually improving balance of 
payments position (helped by a sharp drop in imports, the lowest trade deficit seen in a 
decade, and a fx reserves position that should cross $4bn by June 2021 if privatization 
inflows are booked by then).  Downside risks to our forecasts relate mostly to fx inflows: 
potentially lower FDI due to weaker sentiment or privatization delays and possibly lower 
external grants. By contrast, over-performance is possible on both growth and inflation 
(if crops show upside surprises) and on net BOP inflows (depending on the remittance 
recovery and final debt service agreements). Overall, while this year’s macro picture 
does present a fragile situation in some areas, we see no basis for viewing the economy 
as being in a downward spiral (or ‘stuck in the mud’ as some have put it), and are actually 
inclined to expect a year of two halves in 2021—one marked by cautious conditions and 
moderate business/economic activity till mid-year but then followed by a gradually 
strengthening economy (including possibly a ‘roaring recovery’) for the second half of 
2021 and into 2022 conditional on substantive post-conflict improvements in the North, 
elections in June that proceed without much disruption, and a reform drive—including 
privatization—that gathers more attention and more momentum as implementation of 
the new Ten-Year Development Plan becomes a reality in the coming year.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 
 
Ethiopia’s Macroeconomic Outlook in 2021 
 
1. Covid: The Covid pandemic’s macroeconomic impact in Ethiopia will continue to be quite modest, in our view.  
Although a few relatively small sub-segments of the economy were hit hard as expected, an increasingly visible 
recovery is taking place across most sectors. As of early 2021, trends in the pandemic itself showed few reasons 
for alarm, with new case counts and daily deaths at about one-third of their peak levels, a comparatively low critical 
case count, a stable positivity rate, and a death rate that is just one fifth the norm seen among the world’s most 
populous countries; the latter underscores that Ethiopia is experiencing very low mortality rates even if actual 
infections levels are substantially under-reported due to limited testing. With respect to impacts on the economy, 
recent monthly and quarterly activity data reveal a recovery for tourism, airline receipts, industrial park exports, 
banking, and tax collections. At the same time, the economy’s largest sectors (crops, construction, wholesale/retail 
trading) have seen only minor or modest covid-specific impacts judging from a variety of indicators. In short, thanks 
to what appears to be a mild variant of the virus in Ethiopia and considering the upcoming preparations to start 
widespread vaccinations (the target is to soon cover 9mn people and perhaps 20% of population by year-end), we 
think Ethiopia will overcome the covid pandemic with comparatively fewer economic scars than in most other 
countries.  
 
2. Conflict: Seen from a narrowly macroeconomic perspective, we continue to expect that the nation-wide macro 
impacts of the conflict in northern Ethiopia are likely to be limited (this does not, of course, address the conflict’s 
major humanitarian impacts and social disruptions and thus offers only a partial and incomplete picture). A 
compilation of data on the Tigray region’s relative weight in key economic activities—crop production, budgetary 
spending, exports, banking activity, cement production, investment registrations, and others—shows a median 
share of near 8 percent and thus suggests that nationwide macro impacts will be modest if economic activity 
remains largely unaffected in the rest of the country. Past episodes of conflict in the area also point to a quick 
recovery following the year of conflict. However, while short-term impacts will likely be modest, it is of course 
harder to rule out adverse longer-term impacts on investor sentiment (including FDI), donor flows, and on the 
overall business climate if the conflict brings a protracted period of tensions and disruptions in the region, or even 
beyond.  For our baseline assumption for 2021, and given recent indications from Government and donors, we 
think it is more likely than not that policies will soon begin to meaningfully address large humanitarian needs in 
the Region, while also gradually restoring normalcy to infrastructure links, commerce, and economic activity.  
 
3. Crops: The size of this year’s crop harvest—to become apparent from official statistics in the coming months—will 
have major implications for GDP growth, food security, inflation, and emergency import requirements this year. 
While the outlook early on in the fiscal year was quite positive (thanks to good rains, high fertilizer imports, rising 
acreage under cultivation, increased irrigation usage, expanded commercial cluster farming, and greater use of 
modern machinery), a series of subsequent shocks in late 2020—locusts, conflict, harvest disruptions—imply 
potentially significant negative shocks in at least some localized areas.  What the net effect will be remains highly 
uncertain, and may vary substantially by crop and by region. The latest assessment from Ministry of Agriculture 
officials suggests the crop harvest could be as high as 37mn tons this year versus 34mn tons last year, which if 
accurate would imply a bumper year with a high rate of agricultural growth. We are unsure if such a large output 
boost is possible and remain of the view (until the final crop estimates are released) that expecting this year’s crop 
volumes to be close to last year’s outturns may be a more realistic assumption; this remains our baseline case and 
forms the basis for our 4 percent overall GDP growth projection for 2020-21.

4. Credit: One of the biggest private sector concerns post-covid has been the potential for a sharp drop in bank credit, 
both on the demand side (as firms facing slowdowns avoid new borrowing) as well as the supply side (as banks 
reduce lending to cope with rising NPLs). While pockets of business activity have surely been affected and reduced 
their loan demand, the anticipated slowdown in overall credit growth has not materialized. In fact, end-2020 data 
show continued strong lending growth across both public and private banks, with total bank lending up 12 percent 
for the quarter and 33 percent year-on-year, 12 out of 16 private banks showing more than 30 percent annual loan 
growth, and lending at CBE up by a very substantial rate—given its size—of 25 percent. Moreover, based on data 
from 2020, a major system-wide NPL problem also does not appear to be emerging at private banks (aided in part 
by central bank forbearance) and even the likely uptick in NPLs this coming year should be one that most banks 
can cope with given their low initial (NPL) starting positions, good provisioning levels, and on-going growth in their 
lending books. A credit crunch is thus not on the horizon either for 2021 or 2022, in our view. 
 
5. Creditors: The status of Ethiopia’s relations with its external creditors (lenders) has recently become of some 
concern, given the suspension of financial support by some external partners, two credit rating agency downgrades 
related to anticipated debt relief, and what had been (until recently) a still-pending IMF program review.  In this 
connection, we review the overall profile of Ethiopia’s recent external borrowing plus the size of its external debt 
and debt service obligations, and conclude that: (1) the external support suspended so far remains quite limited 
(relative both to the size of Ethiopia’s budget and annual fx inflows); (2) the country’s external debt load still 
appears manageable by most metrics and a reprofiling of near-term debt service dues is likely sufficient to relieve 
near-term repayment pressures; and (3) concerns of a ‘default’ on Ethiopia’s sole sovereign bond—the focus of 
recent credit agency downgrades—seem overblown given that its share in total debt/debt service is very small. 
The recent announcement of a staff-level agreement for the IMF’s first and second program reviews provides a 
significant endorsement of the direction of macro policy reforms and should instill confidence among Ethiopia’s 
creditors. As important, it boosts the volume of fx inflows coming in before the end of this fiscal year (June 2021) 
by paving the way for disbursements from the IMF, from multilaterals, and from other creditors whose anticipated 
debt service relief is typically aligned with an on-going IMF program. 
 
6. Currency: Considering the large currency depreciation effected last year and the improvement seen in one measure 
of competitiveness (REER basis), there was some progress made in addressing the Birr’s misalignment in 2020. 
Despite this, however, the gap with the parallel rate is still substantial (~25 percent) and fx waiting times still 
significant (in the range of 4-6 months, or more, per information from several banks). For the period ahead, as the 
current managed fx regime is likely to remain in place throughout 2021, we expect the central bank will continue 
with the gradual exchange rate crawl it has used to adjust the Birr, though doing so at a much more moderate pace 
from here on due to declining inflation and improving BOP prospects. This approach is unlikely to be sufficient to 
end the Birr’s misalignment, and so we do not expect any marked improvement—for most businesses in most 
sectors—in the fx waiting times faced at banks. A major reform of the exchange rate regime—one that corrects 
the currency’s misalignment and allows for its flexible movement—would eliminate fx queuing and shortages at 
banks and is already a clearly stated Government policy commitment, but the timing for its actual implementation 
remains unspecified so far. In our view, a late 2021 date for this reform might be possible if macro/BOP outturns 
were to significantly over-perform in the second half of 2021, but a more realistic prospect for such a major 
overhaul of the fx regime would be in 2022 or 2023, when inflation should be at much lower rates and foreign 
exchange reserves at much higher levels. In the interim, we expect that the central bank’s gradualist approach to 
currency adjustments will still aim to avoid a real appreciation of the currency; a 15 percent year-on-year nominal 
depreciation would be sufficient for this purpose, thus implying a Birr level of near 42 per USD by June 2021 and 
near 45 per USD by December 2021.

Section 1: Covid and the Macroeconomy 
 
• Recent data on the covid pandemic’s spread in Ethiopia show few reasons for alarm: new case counts are 
roughly one-third their peak levels, ICU cases are comparatively low, and daily death figures are at one-third of 
their former peaks while remaining very low relative to population size. Limited testing (2 million people so far 
but just 2% of the population) and a 10 percent positivity rate among those tested (though likely overstated 
due to a sample bias in those tested) are notable areas of concern. Even so, the low overall death rate plus the 
imminent start of a vaccinations offer some relief and reassurances for the period ahead. 
 
• The first set of official GDP numbers released since the start of the pandemic show covid impacts mainly in the 
form of large drops in growth rates and concentrated in about five sectors; the sharpest effects were seen in 
transport (-20 percentage points drop in growth), hotels & restaurants (-7 ppts), public administration (-7 ppts), 
wholesale/retail trade (-5ppts) and construction (-5ppts). 
 
• Signs of a V-shaped recovery are emerging in multiple areas, though much more strongly in some than in others. 
Overall, across most sectors, economic actors are adjusting to living with the new post-covid reality—the 
dominant crop sector was largely unaffected to begin with, while other large sectors are now either fully/mostly 
re-opened (construction, airline activity, public administration, education, health), or gradually recovering 
(tourism, hospitality).   
 
Overall Covid trends 
 
As of early 2021, trends in the Covid pandemic’s spread in Ethiopia show new reported cases at roughly 600 
per day or roughly one-third of their August 2020 peak of 1,800 new cases per day (Table 1.1).

Ethiopia’s reported death rate also continues to be very low in absolute terms and relative to the size of the 
population. The rate of 6 deaths per day is now roughly one-fourth the peak death counts of 25 or more per day 
seen in August 2020 (Table 1.2).   
 
 
 
Testing remains minimal, at around 5,000 per day as of early February, and has shown a decline in recent 
months; however, a cumulative 2 million Ethiopians have been tested so far over the past 10 months (Table 1.3).

Seen in a cross country context, the testing rate of just 2 percent of the population is one of the lowest among 
the world’s 20 most populous countries  (Table 1.4).   
 
 
 
The positivity rate, which captures the share showing positive infections among all tested, has been in the 9 to 
11 percent range in recent months, which remains elevated most likely because of the limited scope of testing 
and the likelihood (reflecting sample bias) that a disproportionate share of those who choose to get tested are 
individuals encountering symptoms (Table 1.5)

Among Africa’s 10 largest economies, 
Ethiopia also shows one of the lowest 
rates of new cases per million people 
(Table 1.8). This rate is just 6 percent 
of the South Africa’s case count, 
though this partly reflects much more 
limited testing in Ethiopia (2 million 
tests covering 2% of the population) 
versus in South Africa (9 million tests 
covering 15% of the population).  
 
 
 
 
 
Death rates relative to the population 
are particularly low when seen against 
the world’s most populous countries 
(Table 1.9)… 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
…but closer to the average death rate 
(excluding South Africa) when seen in 
comparison to Africa’s ten largest

Like most of the recent of the continent, Ethiopia has been late to receive and start vaccinations, but recent 
government announcements point to several initiatives coming soon in this area (Table 1.11).  
 
 
 
Macro impacts from covid 
 
The first set of official GDP numbers released since the start of the pandemic (for FY 2019-20) provide a partial 
picture of the Covid pandemic’s macro impacts, and show about five sectors experiencing large drops in growth 
rates—especially for transport (which includes airline activity and showed a 20 percentage points drop in the 
growth rate), hotels and restaurants (-7 ppts), public administration (-7 ppts), wholesale and retail trade (-5 ppts ), 
and construction (-5 ppts); (Table 1.12).

Recovery from covid 
 
Looking at monthly and quarterly developments since the onset of the pandemic nearly a year ago, there are 
growing signs of a ‘V’-shaped recovery emerging in several areas—though not as strongly and consistently as one 
might have hoped in some cases.  Areas showing a strong rebound include tourism arrivals, airline activity, credit 
growth, industrial park exports, revenue collections, and remittances, while other activity indicators (overall 
exports, cement production) are less clear-cut and consistent (Table 1.13).

Looking ahead  
 
Looking ahead, there are strong reasons to expect that covid-specific impacts on the economy will gradually fade 
away during the rest of 2021: the crop sector remains largely unaffected with its output levels determined by other 
sector-specific factors (see Section 3); fiscal stimulus measures (~3% GDP) are still helping those affected sectors 
stage a recovery; monetary stimulus and regulatory accommodation continues to support banks and their 
borrowers; and economic actors are adjusting to living with the new post-covid reality (including in many service 
activities such as education, health, hospitality, trading, and travel). In such an environment, it is other conventional 
growth drivers—crop outturns, construction, credit developments, government spending, and BOP 
developments—as well as special circumstances such as the recent conflict that will have a stronger bearing on 
Ethiopia’s macroeconomic developments and growth prospects. It is  precisely these areas that are covered in the 
following sections, including the outlook with respect to the conflict, crops, credit, creditor relations, and the 
currency.

Section 2: Conflict and the Macroeconomy 
 
• A compilation of data on the Tigray region’s share in various economic activities—crop production, exports, 
banking activity, investments, cement production, and others—shows a median share of 8 percent and thus 
suggests that nationwide macro impacts will be modest if business activity remains largely unaffected in the 
rest of the country.  
 
• While short-term macro impacts from the recent conflict will likely be limited, it is harder to rule out potential 
adverse longer-term impacts on investor sentiment (including FDI), donor flows, and on the overall business 
climate if the conflict brings a protracted period of tensions and disruptions in the region, or even beyond. 
 
• For our baseline assumption for 2021, and given recent indications from Government and donors, we think it 
is more likely than not that policies will soon begin to meaningfully address large humanitarian needs in the 
Region, while also gradually restoring normalcy to infrastructure links, commerce, and economic activity. 
 
The nationwide macro impacts of the recent conflict in Tigray can be assessed by viewing the region’s share in overall 
economic activity—particularly in areas such as total crop production, budget spending, cement output, exports, 
banking activity, domestic airline traffic, and FDI investment registrations (Table 2.1). 
 
 
 
 
Focusing on food production, the Region’s share of national crop output has averaged 6 percent in recent years (Table 
2.2A). The Region has a higher-than-average contribution in the production of sesame, barley, and lentils, and 
especially so in the case of sesame (Table 2.2B).

Looking at 2020 data before the conflict, the Region’s share of industrial park exports is seen fluctuating significantly 
but has averaged roughly 8 percent over the past two years and shown a generally rising trend (Table 2.3). 
 
 
 
The overall composition of the economy within the Region could also matter significantly in determining its macro 
impacts, as sectors with different sizes in could have been exposed to the conflict to varying degrees (Table 2.4). 
Judging from patterns seen in most of Ethiopia’s regions, agriculture (crops) is likely the single most significant sector 
of the regional economy, perhaps taking 30-40 percent of total activity, likely followed by trade, public 
administration, construction, transportation, and social services (health, education).  To the extent that the largest 
sectors are largely unaffected (possibly for crops) or quicker to recover (public administration, education, health), 
then the macro impacts within the region may be correspondingly moderated (Table 2.4).  
 
 
 
A partial but potentially revealing metric to see the conflict’s perceived impact can be seen from risk measures as 
captured in the Eurobond yield. As expected, this risk measure showed a large spike at the onset of the conflict, but 
perceptions shifted quickly thereafter—at least as seen by foreign investors—and the yield fell to pre-conflict levels 
by late December; this suggests that investor perceptions of near-term economic impacts had reverted ‘back-to-

(Table 2.5). 
 
 
One other approach to assessing the macro risks of the recent conflict might be to review similar episodes of conflict 
in the past and the path of key macro variables following the conflict. In this context, the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict 
of 1997-98 (also largely concentrated in the Tigray Region) shows a temporary deterioration in key macro variables 
but a quick recovery following the end of active hostilities (Table 2.6) 
 
 
 
Looking ahead, tracing how key macro transmission channels—namely the real, fiscal, monetary, and external 
sectors—might be affected suggests low to moderate impacts in many areas but potentially significant effects in 
certain spheres such trade, fiscal expenditure, and some fx flows. Also, the longer-term consequences of the conflict 
may become significant if the restoration of regular humanitarian/social services, critical infrastructure links, and 
commercial/economic activities is prolonged. (Table 2.7).

With respect to reconstruction activities as of early 2021, recent Government reports suggest an acceleration of 
efforts across multiple areas—including emergency food relief, health services, refugee assistance—while various 
infrastructure and commercial links are reported to be in the process of being gradually restored  (Table 2.8). At the 
same time, donor reports indicate that the humanitarian needs still fall far short of the Region’s large requirements 
but with some progress said to have taken place in recent weeks.

Area
Sub-area
Potential impacts on regional economy and/or broader national macroeconomy
Severity of Negative 
Impacts for Region
Crops
Disruption to farms due to conflict; late/disrupted harvests lowering yields
LOW
Construction
Potentially significant in certain areas, but recovery could involve strong growth
MEDIUM to HIGH
Industry
Potentially significant and long-lasting in certain urban areas and industries to the extent 
that industries have been damaged or rendered no longer functional
HIGH
Trade
Sharp slowdowns would occur during conflict, but quick bounce back likely for 
wholesale/retain trade after opening of infrastructure links
HIGH, but short-lived
Public services
After short-lived interruptions, school and medical services would be expected to be 
restored by Government in near-term (and already partly so per recent reports).
HIGH, but short-lived
Private services Potentially longer time for restoration of tourism, hotels, restaurant, & other such services HIGH
Revenue
Reduced regional and national revenue due to loss in income tax, VAT, other collections
LOW TO MEDIUM
Expenditure
Large reconstruction needs will bring increased expenditure, but this may be mitigated 
somewhat by spending re-allocations, higher transfers likely, & private sector contributions
MEDIUM to HIGH
Transfers
Net transfers from Govt, and external sources (intl orgs, NGOs) likely to be stepped up
…
Bank deposits
Deposit trends likely to be flat/declining, until business activity normalizes
LOW
Bank loans
New lending likely to be stalled until commercia/business activity normalizes
LOW
Banks' NPLs
Bank loans to regions' companies likely to face high number of non-performing cases
HIGH
Exports
Drop in industrial park exports, and in crop exports such as sesame
MEDIUM
Remittances
Remittance flows may potentially increase in response to population needs
LOW
Grants
Conflict-related issues have led to some temporary pause in external funding; however, 
eventual humanitarian and reconstruction related grants may increase over time as and 
once recovery efforts are intensified
…
FDI
Drop in new FDI inflows possible: in particular, longer-term impacts are uncertain and 
dependent of scale and speed of the region's normalization with respect to overall 
stability, humanitarian/social services, infrastructure, and commercial activities

Section 3: Crops and the Macroeconomy 
 
• The size of this year’s crop harvest—one of the single most important determinants of Ethiopia’s GDP growth 
rates—could be anywhere between 335mn to 379mn quintals, per recent estimates/statements by different 
authorities. This large variance suggests agriculture growth could be as low as 0% or as high as 10 percent. 
 
• The high level of uncertainty reflects a combination of many positive developments (good rains, high fertilizer 
usage, more acreage farmed, expanded irrigation, additional cluster farming, and greater use of modern 
machinery) alongside some negative ones that have been particularly significant in certain localities (locust 
invasions, conflict, harvest disruptions).  What the net effect will be is unclear, and may vary substantially by 
crop and by region.  
 
• We are inclined to expect a crop harvest that will be close to last year’s outturns (thus near zero agricultural 
growth), and this forms the basis for our 4 percent overall GDP growth projection for 2020-21.  
 
Recent performance 
 
Ethiopia’s total crop production has shown 
steady increases in recent years and been 
a key source of the country’s underlying 
growth; output is up 26 percent in the last 
five years and 86 percent over the past 
decade (Table 3.1).

Rising output reflected a combination of increased acreage farmed (Table 3.2), as well as notably rising yields, 
which are up from 2.15 tons per hectare five years ago to 2.62 tons per hectare today (Table 3.3).  
 
 
 
 
The recent growth record has pushed Ethiopia’s output for major cereal crops to become among the highest 
levels in Africa (Table 3.4). However, yields are generally below those of large African producers (Table 3.5).

Current year output 
 
The outlook for this year’s crop output is mixed given a range of positive developments (especially early in the 
planting season) offset more recently by several negative ones (Table 3.6). 
 
 
Recent data on ECX crop trading suggests a modest drop in crops supplied to the commodity exchange, on the 
order of -5 percent for all crops combined. However, this is only a partial picture as ECX currently handles mainly 
export-oriented crops and covers only a sub-set of the  several dozen crops produced in Ethiopia (Table 3.7).  
 
 
 
Looking at price trends for key staples (teff, wheat, maize, sugar, edible oil), these reveal increases of 18 to 25 
percent from year-ago levels, suggesting on-going supply constraints (Table 3.8 and 3.9).  
Table 3.6: Crop Outlook for the Current Fiscal Year
Area
Sub-issue
Description and notable developments
Rains
National Meteorological Agency reported 'above-average' rains for most farming areas in June-Sep 2020
Rainfall recorded in main farming areas 14 percent above last year, when crop yields were at historic highs
Acreage farmed
Extensive 'leave-no-lands uncultivated' campaign in place during planting season to raise total hectares farmed
Total acreage farmed estimated by MOA officials to be 13.4mn hectares vs 12.9mn last year, or 3.9% growth
Fertilizers
Fertilizer imports in 2019-20 were near $600mn, up 20%, most to be used in June-Sep planting season
MOA officials indicate that 16 million quintals of fertilizer provided to farmers, implying 119 kgs per hectare if 
fully applied to farm areas under cultivation 
Seeds
MOA officials indicate 700,000 of improved seed varieties provided to farmers
Irrigation
1 million hectares of land covered under irrigation schemes, or 7.5 percent of farmland cultivated
Budget this year allocated Birr 16bn for irrigation, covering 42 separate irrigation projects of near 380mn each
Commercialized 
cluster farming
3 million hectares of land covered under commercialized cluster schemes that are intended to ensure better 
input supplies, coordinated/improved farming techniques, and higher yields; this is 22 percent of farmland.
Loans to agriculture Lending by banks to agriculture was up 13 percent last year, reaching 21bn (though still just 2% of total loans).
Machinery use
1 million hectares of land reported to be farmed using tractors or farm equipment, or 7.5 percent of the total
Locusts
Successive 'locust invasions' affected crop lands during the period from June to December 2020
Areas affected by locusts have been variously estimated from 200,000 to 700,000 hectares, implying impacts on 
1.5 to 5.2 percent of total farmland. Not all the planted crops in affected areas would be destroyed, so impacts 
on crop output would be even lower than this potential range of affected hectares.
Conflict
Farm lands affected by conflict would face varying levels of loss depending on hectares directly affected by 
conflict. Total land under cultivation in Tigray is 0.9mn hectares (7.4% of last year's 12.9mn hectares national 
total), and it is unclear what share of this has been directly impacted by actual conflict.
Harvest
The active conflict period from Nov-Dec 2020 coincided with harvest season, and lower output could be possible 
due to some crops being destroyed, due to insufficient labor being available to harvest crops, or due to post-
harvest losses from disrupted transport links

Overall, considering all of the above factors, we are inclined to expect a crop harvest that will be close to last 
year’s outturns, though upside surprises are possible given the Ministry of Agriculture’s recent statements. For 
our projections, we use a crop figure of near 34mn tons, or zero growth vs last year (Table 3.10).  
 
 
 
Largely reflecting our expectations on crop outturns, and unchanged growth forecasts for industry (9%) and 
services (4%) as in our last Quarterly Macro Review, we expect overall GDP growth of 4.1% this year (Table 3.11).

Section 4: Credit and the Macroeconomy 
 
• Nearly a year into the COVID pandemic, the anticipated slowdown in overall credit growth has not materialized, 
and the latest growth rates in bank lending are instead slightly above recent norms. Year-on-year growth of 
bank loans was 33 percent as of December 2020, versus a 30 percent average for the prior eight quarters.  
 
• For banks, one potential reason to cut back on credit supply would have been a large spike in their level of non-
performing loans (NPLs), but the record in this area appears benign so far, even if some uptick in the NPL ratio 
is possible in the coming year.  
 
• Given recent trends and what appears to be a manageable NPL situation, we do not expect any sharp slowdown 
in credit growth for the rest of 2021. We project bank credit growth of 24 percent for this fiscal year (including 
banks’ T-Bill and bond purchases), supported in part by strong deposit growth of near 25 percent.  
 
Despite expectations that there would be a credit crunch facing banks and their borrowers following the onset of the 
pandemic, lending by banks shows no signs of slowing. Indeed, supported by strong deposit increases (which, in turn, 
were boosted by the recent currency conversion), overall bank lending levels have continued to rise strongly up to 
December 2020 (Table 4.1).

Growth trends show bank lending is now up 12 percent for the most recent quarter and also up 33 versus year-ago 
levels, or higher than the annual growth rates seen over the past eight quarters (Table 4.2). 
 
 
 
The lending growth is broad-based, and is being registered at both public and private banks. Among the 16 private 
banks, almost all showed annual credit growth of more than 20 percent as of December 2020 and three-quarters of 
private banks showed annual credit growth rates in excess of 30 percent (Table 4.3).

Part of the expectation for slower credit growth stemmed from fears that banks would face a large spike in NPLs 
following the Covid pandemic.  However, judging from June 2020 data (only one quarter into the pandemic but the 
latest available figures), NPL ratios have not yet shown a big jump, partly due to the central bank’s flexible rules 
allowing banks to reschedule troubled loans (somewhat higher NPLs may thus appear in banks’ financial reports of 
only in 2020-21). Seen by individual bank, NPL ratios range from 1 to 5 percent (Table 4.4A) which, even at the upper 
end of this range, is still a comparatively low rate when seen in a cross-country context. Provisions are also cover a 
sizeable share of NPLs at most banks, and averaged 55% across the sector as a whole (Table 4.4B)

Seen as a group, average NPLs are not only lower compared to last year, but provisions are also higher compared to 
year-ago levels. After accounting for provision levels that banks hold as reserve, the net NPL ratio averaged only 1.5 
percent at private banks this year, down from 1.8 percent last year  (Table 4.5).  
 
 
 
Looking at credit developments by sector, and comparing September 2020 outturns to year-ago levels, above-
average growth rates were seen for domestic trade loans, export loans and housing & construction loans, while 
below- average loan growth was recorded for the hotels & tourism and transport sectors (Table 4.6). Overall, it is 
notable that even some sub-sectors that might have been expected to be heavily covid-affected showed strong credit 
growth, especially for domestic trade, hotels and tourism, and exports.

Looking at total outstanding credit levels, the sectors with the highest credit allocations are industry (35% of total 
loans to the non-government sector), domestic trade (15%), exports (15%), housing and construction (11%), and 
personal loans (8%). In general, these are also the same sectors that saw the highest increment in loans in recent 
years (Table 4.7A and 4.7B).  
 
 
 
Looking ahead, we expect still strong trends in credit growth since: (1) the NPL outlook is not threatening enough to 
lead banks to cut back sharply on their lending activities; (2) interest rate reductions on loans—now initiated by many 
banks—are likely to spur borrower demand; and (3) the broader economy is likely to strengthen, not weaken, for the 
period ahead. Accordingly, we expect that for both 2020-21 and 2021-22, total bank financing—a broader credit 
measure that captures banks’ loans, T-Bill purchases, and Bond holdings—can continue to grow at the higher end of 
the 20-25 percent annual rate seen in recent years (Table 4.8), supported by continued robust deposit growth in both 
years (Table 4.8).

Section 5: Creditors and the Macroeconomy 
 
• The status of Ethiopia’s relations with its external creditors (lenders) has been of some concern in recent 
months, given the pause in financial support by some external partners, two credit rating agency downgrades 
(by Fitch and S&P) following recent announcements on debt relief, and the extended time taken for completion 
of the IMF program’s first review.  
 
• In this connection, we review closely recent trends in Ethiopia’s external borrowing as well as the size of 
upcoming debt and debt service obligations. In our view, the data continue to show that Ethiopia has a 
manageable debt problem, though there remains a challenging near-term repayment burden given close to 
$2bn in annual debt service dues (to mainly multilateral/official lenders). A re-profiling of debt service dues 
over the coming years would largely address near-term repayment pressures, and this was indeed the approach 
already taken by Ethiopia (with China in 2019) even before the recent DSSI and Common Framework initiatives 
that arose following the Covid pandemic. Regarding the size of recently suspended external financing, we find 
this is still a small share of total budget support (and an even smaller share of total fx inflows), while the 
Government’s exposure to sovereign bond creditors—the subject of much attention in recent weeks and the 
primary focus of rating agencies—is of such a comparatively small magnitude that it seems unlikely to be a 
major focus of upcoming debt service reprofilings. The likelihood of a principal debt reduction on any category 
of external debt appears to be extremely low.  
 
• One notable area of uncertainty until recently had been the timing of the IMF first program review and the 
associated conclusions of the IMF’s debt sustainability assessment.  The latter analysis, in particular, will shape 
the scope of creditor reprofiling that is deemed necessary to reduce the near-term debt service burden and the 
associated risk of debt distress (from a ‘high’ to a ‘medium’ rating).  With the recent announcement that a staff-
level agreement has now been reached for the first and second reviews, as well as the positive endorsement 
implied on the stance of macro policies, this removes a significant cloud of uncertainty that had been in place 
concerning creditor relations and paves the way for substantial fx inflows over the coming months, including 
the IMF’s own program disbursements, multilateral development bank loans, and debt service relief.  
 
Recent trends in creditor relations: 
 
Ethiopia’s relations with most of its external creditors have strengthened in recent years, with annual loan 
disbursements from external lenders averaging $3.2bn in recent years, about 3% of GDP. On a commitment basis, 
there was an even stronger trend seen in recent years, with annual loan commitments rising from $2.6bn two years 
ago to nearly $5bn in 2019-20  (Table 5.1A and 5.1B).

External lenders have mostly been multilateral institutions in recent years, which implies loans with very favourable 
terms such as low interest rates and long maturities. On the borrower’s side, the Government made up about 70 
percent of new loans while state enterprises comprised only 30 percent of the total. Most borrowing by government 
is from multilaterals and most borrowing by SOEs is from bilateral and commercial creditors (Table 5.2).

Net flows (new loans less repayments) were generally positive in recent years, but stricter controls on SOE borrowing 
have for the first time resulted in debt service payments in July-December 2020 exceeding new debt accumulation  
during the same period (Table 5.3).  
 
 
 
For the central government, net flows are still significantly positive, but for SOEs the size of their repayments on past 
loans now exceeds the new loans that they are taking on (Tables 5.4 and 5.5).

For China, and seen from a decade-long perspective, the vast majority of new borrowing was directed towards the 
infrastructure sector, including most notably for railways, expressways, sugar factories, airports, power plants, and 
transmission lines (Table 5.7).

With respect to non-official lenders (i.e., commercial banks, suppliers credits, and Eurobond holders), most of the 
recent borrowing in this area has reflected Ethiopian Airlines aircraft purchases with financing provided by European, 
Canadian, and Japanese banks (Table 5.8A). For Ethiopia’s sole Eurobond issued in 2014, the buyers and current holders 
are mostly large US-based mutual funds, bond funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) (Table 5.8B).

Recent debt rescheduling initiatives and creditor/investor concerns 
 
Following the COVID pandemic, and as part recent G-20 initiatives to assist developing countries, Ethiopia has 
participated in the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (or DSSI) and, more recently, indicated plans to participate in a 
new ‘Common Framework’ initiative. Ethiopia’s on-going effort to improve the debt service profile of its external debt 
actually builds upon earlier efforts in this area with one of its official creditors (with China in 2019) but the recent 
‘Common Framework’ announcement has generated much reaction and commentary as it potentially implied that 
Ethiopia would also seek debt relief from its commercial lenders, including possibly its Eurobond holders. A timeline 
of past efforts in this area, recent developments, investor reactions, and the near-term outlook is summarized in Table 
5.9 and 5.10 below.

Table 5.10:  Ethiopia--Timeline of Debt Relief Approaches, Recent Developments, and Near-term Outlook
2019
● Debt rescheduling agreed covering ~$3bn of state enterprise external debt owed to China by the Ethiopian Railway Corporation
● Per press reports, terms of the debt relief included a significant maturity extension from 10 to 30 years.
2020
● Following the COVID pandemic, Ethiopia took advantage of debt service relief under the Debt Service Suspension initiative (DSSI)
● Debt service relief under the DSSI has been around $112mn million on a six-month basis, per MOF debt data, or ~$220mn annualized
2021
Common Framework
● Ethiopia announces in late January plans to request debt relief as part of the G-20 'Common Framework' (CF) initiative
●  The expectation is also that both official creditors and private creditors will be asked to provide 'comparable treatment'
Rating Agency and Investors reactions
● All three major ratings agencies provided rating updates/actions after Ethiopia's announcement of its Common Framework participation
●  S&P's: Downgrade from 'B' to 'B-' on the basis of potential debt restructuring under the Common Framework
Source: G-20 Common Framework Statement, MOF press release of Feb 1, 2020, and IMF press release of Feb 23, 2021.
Also, rating release from Fitch, Moody's, and S&P as well as analyst reports from Morgan Stanley, Tellimer Research, Oxford Analytica, and Renaissance Capital. 
●  Regarding the issue of potential private sector inclusion, the MOF's statement indicates that only after completion of the DSA 
will the Ministry "be in a position to inform its other creditors of the need for broader debt treatment discussions in accordance 
with the comparability of treatment rule." The statement also adds that "[the Ministry] is confident that the possible 
implementation of the debt treatment under the Common Framework will address debt vulnerabilities of the country, while 
preserving long-term access to international financial markets"
●  Fitch: Downgraded Ethiopia's rating from 'B' to 'CCC'. FItch noted that "the downgrade reflects the Government's 
announcement that it is looking to make use of the G20 'Common Framework' , which although still an untested mechanism, 
explicitly raises the risk of a default event.  However, Fitch also adds that "there remains uncertainty over how the G20 Common 
Framework will be implemented in practice, including the requirement for private sector participation," and also notes that "the 
Paris Club [creditors] requirement for comparable treatment by other creditors can be waived in some circumstances, including 
when the debt represents only a small proportion of the country's debt burden"
●  Moody's: Kept rating unchanged at 'B' but with a negative outlook. Moody's notes in its commentary that "given the continued 
uncertainty regarding how the DSSI will be implemented, our view remains that the risks to private-sector creditors are captured 
in the negative outlook on Ethiopia's rating... For now, we continue to assume that an application for debt relief under the 
Common Framework--like subscribing to the DSSI--in and of itself need not necessarily entail private-creditor losses"
● Sovereign Bond: Yields on Ethiopia's sole sovereign bond jumped by around 2 percentage points, from 6.5% to 8.5% at its peak, 
before moderating somewhat to 8 percent as of mid-February.
● Investor/Analyst Reactions:  Commentary from some investment banks and research analysts has included statements that 
generally show uncertainty about the inclusion of Ethiopia's private external bondholders under the Common Framework:. For 
example, analysts have observed: (1) "The key issue would be how insistent bilateral creditors would be on the private sector 
participating (Morgan Stanley); (2) "Private sector involvement may be necessary under the Common Framework, but it isn't' clear 
what form this will take... and whether Ethiopia's Eurobond will be included" (Tellimer Research); (3) "Bondholders are the least likely 
creditors to be approached" (Oxford Analytica); and (4) "It is not set in stone that the G-20 demands the same treatment from the 
private sector" (Renaissance Capital).
●  One area of uncertainty remains whether debt service relief would be sought from creditors holding Ethiopia's sole sovereign bond, 
which represents 3 percent of total external debt and 3 percent of 2021 debt service.
●  While the G-20 Statement on the Common Framework indicates expectations of comparable treamment, it is also the case 
(from past practice and as highlighted by the analyst commentary above) that G-20 and Paris Club creditors have not insisted on 
private sector participation when amounts are comparatively small.
●  Ethiopia's Ministry of Finance statement on this matter indicates only general principles that it will "aim to reduce debt 
vulnerabilities and lower the risk of debt distress to moderate by the end of the [IMF] program"
● The Common Framework initiative, led by the G-20 in November 2020, is intended to provide debt relief beyond what was already 
granted to many developing countries (for Covid related spending) under DSSI in 2020. 
● Outlook for the period ahead
●  Per the G-20 Comminique on the Common Framework, in most cases, "debt treatments will not  be conducted in the form of debt 
write-off or cancellation," but some debt cancellation or write-off may be considered in "the most difficult cases" 
●  The Debt Sustainability Assessment (DSA) is expected to provide the scale of debt relief needed to reduce the debt distress risk 
from high to medium by the end of the IMF program period (2023). The recent IMF statement indicates expectations of only a 
"reprofilig of debt service obligations," which is not surprising given Ethiopia's debt ratios.
●  Ethiopia is to secure assurances for debt relief from key creditors. This would be expected to include official bilateral creditors, 
including Paris Club creditors and non-Paris Club creditors such as China, India, Turkey, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and UAE.
●  The very recent announcement of a staff-level agreement on the First and Second Reviews of the IMF program has, besides 
endorsing the Government's macro policies, now provided a framework for creditors to engage on debt service relief discussions.  
While the IMF Staff Report and associated Debt Sustainability Analysis has not yet been released,  the press statement indicates that 
the IMF supports "the authories' aim to lower the risk of debt distress to medium by reprofiling debt service obligations". It also notes 
that "receipt of the necessary financing assurances from international partners" is anticipated which (per usual IMF procedures) is 
likey to have either been received or expected to be forthcoming shortly if the program is being presented for Board approval.

In the context of the Common Framework initiative, a review of the composition of Ethiopia’s debt shows that debt 
relief from foreign creditors would mainly affect multilateral and bilateral lenders (Table 5.11). Most notably, 
multilateral institutions make up roughly half of all external debt, official bilateral lenders—including China—make 
up 28 percent, and private commercial lenders make up 22 percent. The latter group of private lenders includes 
institutions from China, Europe, US, and holders of the Eurobond.  
 
 
 
Reflecting the different interest rates and maturities offered by different lenders, near-term debt service payments 
are, however, dominated by obligations due to commercial and official bilateral creditors rather than to multilateral 
lenders (as the latter offer very low interest rates and very long payback periods). In recent years, about 57 percent of 
annual debt service dues have gone to commercial creditors (of which 3 percent to Eurobond holders), 31 percent to 
official bilateral creditors, and 12 percent to multilateral lenders (Table 5.12).

Looking at debt service dues in the year ahead, namely for 2021, the largest obligations are—as in recent years—due 
to commercial creditors (48 percent, reflecting large SOE repayments), official bilateral creditors (35 percent) and 
multilateral creditors (15 percent); amounts due to bondholders are only around 3 percent of the total (Table 5.13).  
 
 
 
With Ethiopia’s participation in the ‘Common Framework’ initiative, the 2021 external service obligations of near $2bn 
could be reprofiled under varying degrees of creditor coverage and percentage share of debt service dues.  Depending 
on the universe of creditors covered and the percentage of debt service obligations considered (say from 20% up to 
67% of annual amounts due), the dollar amount of  debt service relief could vary considerably: for example, assuming 
debt service relief mainly from official bilateral creditors and commercial creditors (excluding bondholders) would 
provide savings of between $311mn and $577mn for the year (Table 5.14). For our balance of payments projections, 
we use the actual debt service paid for July-December 2020 and annualize that for the full fiscal year, which implies a 
DSSI-type treatment and thus likely understates the extent of debt relief Ethiopia is likely to receive this year and next. 
We expect the likelihood of a principal debt reduction on any category of external debt to be extremely low, as indeed

seems to be confirmed by the recent IMF statement indicating the “the authorities aim to lower the risk of debt distress 
rating to moderate by reprofiling debt service obligations.” 
 
 
 
External financing outlook 
 
Separate from the issue of debt relief, one area of concern relating to creditor relations has also been the overall 
external financing outlook for the current and upcoming years. In this regard, while there has been a temporary pause 
of some external financing linked to the recent conflict (~$100mn from the EU for example), it is a comparatively small 
share of total anticipated external support (Table 5.15). It is an even smaller share of overall fx inflows, which are close 
to $22bn annually when considering goods exports, service exports, remittances, transfers, grants, FDI, new borrowing, 
and private capital flows.

From a medium-term perspective, it is also notable that there is a substantial stock of committed but not-yet-disbursed 
funding, equivalent to roughly $11.4bn as of December 2020, that is still largely anticipated from a range of external 
creditors and that will still sustain official sector financing flows over the coming years (Table 5.16). This stock of 
committed funding remains significant and broad-based, considering especially the range of partnerships established 
across both multilateral and bilateral creditors, and often under multi-year cooperation, advisory, and lending 
programs. The very recent completion of the IMF program review, which endorsed the Government’s macro policies 
and typically provides creditors with strong assurances of the stance of macro/structural policies, further boosts the 
likelihood that substantial external support will continue this year as well as over the medium-term. Balance of 
payments support linked to completion of the IMF program review will, by itself, provide near-term funding of SDR 
448mn, or $646mn, judging by the disbursement schedule laid out in the IMF’s original staff report.

Section 6: Currency and the Macroeconomy 
 
• Despite a large nominal depreciation in 2020, the gap between the official and parallel rate remains substantial 
at the start of 2021 while fx waiting times at banks remain significant. 
 
• Reform of the foreign exchange regime—one that corrects the currency’s misalignment and allows for its 
flexible movement—would eliminate fx queuing and shortages at banks, but such a major overhaul seems 
likely to occur only in 2022 or 2023, when inflation should be more firmly reduced and fx reserves at more 
comfortable levels. 
 
• In the interim, we expect the central bank to continue using a gradual exchange rate crawl in managing the 
currency, with pace of adjustment likely to be slower this year given declining inflation and improving balance 
of payments conditions. We expect the Birr will depreciate by at most 15 percent over the course of 2021 
compared to a 23 percent drop seen in 2020.  
 
To assess how far and how fast the Birr is likely to move in 2021, we review recent developments and the near-term 
outlook in four key areas: (1) the real effective exchange rate; (2) the parallel market gap and indicators of excess fx 
demand; (3) the balance of payments position, and; (4) central bank policy signals on near-term policy intentions. 
 
Real effective exchange rate 
 
The Birr exchange rate vs the US dollar has moved substantially this year, reaching a peak nominal depreciation rate 
of 28 percent in November 2020, but moderating more recently to an annualized rate of about 23 percent as of mid-
February 2021 (Table 6.1).

The rate of currency depreciation is even sharper when seen against other currencies, as the exchange rate for the 
Birr is set against the USD and the USD has depreciated versus other major currencies, which further magnifies the 
Birr’s depreciation versus those major currencies (Table 6.2). 
 
 
 
Ethiopia’s rate of depreciation is also significant when seen in a cross-country context, with Ethiopia showing the 
second sharpest currency adjustment among Africa’s largest economies. Among emerging market economies, only 
Brazil and Turkey among showed a 20-percent plus annual deprecation in 2020 (Table 6.3).

Expressed in Birr cents, the rate of depreciation has averaged 60 cents per month for the past year, but this is now 
moderating substantially in early 2021 to just 25 cents in January 2021 and an expected 50 cents in February 2021 
(Table 6.4). 
 
 
 
The real effective exchange rate, one measure of the country’s competitiveness vis-à-vis trading partners, has 
depreciated by around 10 percent last fiscal year (2019-20) and is likely to fall by a similar magnitude this fiscal year 
(2020-21), reversing what had been a deteriorating trend seen for most of the past decade (Table 6.5). The current 
level of the REER index (at 163) stands at about 3 percent above the past ten-year average (157) and 19 percent above 
the past twenty-year average (137), suggesting an exchange rate that is still not as depreciated—in real terms—versus 
its historical norms.

Parallel rate and excess fx market demand 
 
The gap between the official and parallel market rates continues to point to a situation of excess demand and a still 
misaligned official rate. After some improvement in the second half of 2020, and despite several recent 
administrative/regulatory measures to limit those suspected to be involved in parallel market activities (i.e., limits on 
the size and frequency of cash withdrawals), the gap between the official and parallel market rates has stayed in the 
range of 25-30 percent in recent months (Table 6.6). 
 
 
  
Information from commercial banks also confirms extended waiting times at banks for accessing foreign exchange, 
involving queues of 4 to 6 months, or more, depending on the specific import product or sector (given varying priority 
categories in the waiting list system used by banks). Given monthly imports of $900mn  (excluding franco-valuta 
imports that do not use banking system fx funds), the estimated backlog of unmet fx demand could be as large as $3bn 
to $5bn even after accounting for some likely double-counting in import applications presented to banks (Table 6.7).

Balance of payments 
 
A large balance of payments deficit last fiscal year ($900mn) coincided with a sizeable Birr depreciation for the year.  
The BOP deficit in 2019-20 was covered by a combination of a small gross reserves drawdown ($200mn) as well as by 
an accumulation of net fx liabilities ($700mn). For the current fiscal year, we expect a swing to a sizeable BOP surplus 
reflecting the very substantial reduction in the trade and current account deficits, both of which are at decade-long 
lows relative to GDP thanks to lower imports (down 10 percent), strong growth in exports and airline receipts, and 
improving remittance inflows. At the same time, the capital account should benefit from still significant loan inflows 
for the year (we forecast $1.1bn in net borrowing by the government based on last six-month trends) as well as more 
than $3bn of FDI inflows after accounting for anticipated privatization revenue. We also include in our baseline 
projection the IMF Board’s approval of the first and second program reviews (and associated external funding) before 
June 2021, which will boost fx reserves at fiscal year-end through the IMF’s own disbursements, associated multilateral 
loans and the endorsement of debt service reprofiling by other external creditors. Reflecting all of the above, and 
despite possible underperformance in some sub-set of grants relative to earlier expectations, the overall BOP should 
register a significant surplus and thus not be a source of depreciation pressures on the currency this year (Table 6.8)

Central bank policy direction and currency outlook   
 
With respect to central bank policy directions/reforms as they relate to the currency, the NBE’s foreign exchange 
objectives appear to be still focused on avoiding any REER appreciation, as was successfully achieved in end-2020. In 
other words, nominal rates of depreciation have largely moved to compensate for observed inflation outturns plus 
some small margin. Per its public announcements, potential reforms to the policy fx regime are so far still focused on 
laying out a roadmap for market-based exchange rates over the medium-term. On timing, actual implementation of 
the new fx regime is unlikely in 2021 and more realistic in 2022 or 2023 when supporting conditions (low inflation, 
strong fx reserves) will be deemed to be more firmly established. Given these considerations (a somewhat improved 
REER, positive BOP support, no expected change to the current ‘gradual crawl’ fx regime), we expect the magnitude 
and speed of the currency’s move in 2021 will be influenced heavily by inflation outturns in the coming months and 
thus see a much more moderate depreciation in 2021 than in 2020. More specifically, we project that year-on-year 
depreciation rates will trend downwards for the rest of the year, falling from around 24 percent at present to 20 
percent by mid-year and no more than 15 percent by the end of 2021 in line with expected disinflation. Reflecting this 
(presumed) pace of currency adjustment, the associated level implied for the currency is 41.9 Birr/USD by mid-year 
and 44.6 Birr/USD by end-2021 (Table 6.9).

Recent Developments and Outlook  
 
We largely retain the macro forecasts from our last quarterly review in November 2020, 
including our expectations for near-term growth (4.1% this year, 7.5% next year). Compared 
to our projections last quarter, we expect inflation will be slightly worse, the budgetary 
stance broadly unchanged, and the banking and BOP outlook somewhat better.  
 
§ Growth: We continue to project 4.1 percent growth for the current fiscal year, on the basis 
of a broadly unchanged crop output, 9 percent growth in industry, and 4 percent growth in 
services. Although there is much uncertainty on the crop outlook (which may surprise to the 
upside), underlying our growth forecasts for industry and services are expectations that covid 
impacts are fading away, that the recent conflict will not have material macro effects, and 
that credit growth from the banking system will continue at its current strong pace.  
 
§ Inflation: After a series of low monthly price increases, a spike in food prices in January 2021 
has brought an unexpected 1.6 percent month-on-month increase in prices, undermining 
what had been a steadily improving inflation outlook. A reversal of some excise tax cuts, fuel 
price increases, and the pass-through of these fuel price increases (to transport and retail 
prices) will keep inflation elevated in the coming months, despite favorable base effects. We 
adjust slightly upwards our inflation projections to 13.4% by June 2021 and 10% by end-2021.  
 
§ Fiscal policy: Despite multiple shocks, the budget deficit this year is likely to show a ‘normal’ 
level of near 3 percent of GDP (judging from year-to-date trends). As a result, the public debt 
ratio should end the year at 52% of GDP, roughly unchanged from last year, helped too by 
stricter limits on new SOE borrowing. Though exact magnitudes are still to be determined, 
debt service reprofiling by foreign lenders is likely to provide—by our estimates—some 
$300mn to $550mn of relief by stretching out around $2bn of repayments due in 2021.  
 
§ Banking: The banking sector shows no signs of slowing growth, and both deposits and loans 
have largely continued along their pre-covid trajectories. Mid-2020 data do not show a major 
spike in NPLs, and even a modest likely increase this coming year would be manageable given 
low initial (NPL) starting positions, good provision levels, and strong growth in new lending.  
 
§ Balance of payments: After a substantial deficit in 2019-20, the BOP position should swing 
to a sizeable surplus this fiscal year. This will be mainly due to a sharp drop in imports, which 
are down 10 percent and will be roughly $3.5bn lower this fiscal year compared to five years 
ago.  Besides the much-reduced import bill, higher exports, rising airline receipts, and a 
recovery in remittances are also compensating for what is likely to be a lower-than-initially- 
expected inflow of grants. The completion of the IMF first review (for which staff-level 
agreement was recently announced and Board approval likely soon) will unlock substantial 
fx funds and debt service relief, further boosting the outlook for foreign exchange reserves.  
 
§ Exchange rate: A major overhaul of the fx regime does not appear on the horizon for 2021. 
We expect the central bank to continue using a gradual exchange rate crawl in managing the 
currency, with a pace of adjustment that is likely to be slower this year given declining 
inflation and improving balance of payments conditions. We expect the Birr will depreciate 
by at most 15 percent over the course of 2021 compared to a 23 percent drop seen in 2020.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS: 
  
§ 
Among economic indicators for 
which first half of (fiscal) year data 
is available, strong growth trends 
are observed in deposit growth (up 
26 percent aided by the recent 
currency conversion), bank lending 
(up 33 percent), and exports (up 21 
percent in dollar terms). 
 
§ 
Moderate growth is seen in tax 
collections, telecom activity, and 
power generation. 
 
§ 
Negative growth, largely reflecting 
covid impacts, is seen in areas such 
as tourism arrivals, industrial park 
exports, ECX trading, and fuel 
consumption. However, many of 
these same indicators show a 
better 
picture 
when 
seen 
sequentially (i.e. monthly trends 
over the course of 2020, as shown 
below). 
 
Monthly or Quarterly Trends:  
 
§ 
Looking at monthly and/or quarterly activity trends since early 2020, many indicators show an improving 
trajectory, including a pronounced ‘V-shaped’ recovery in some areas.

Growth Outlook 
§ 
The outlook for this year’s crop 
harvest—one of the most important 
determinants of Ethiopia’s GDP 
growth rate—is quite mixed due to a 
range of factors whose net impact is 
uncertain. We are inclined to expect 
a crop harvest that will be close to 
last year’s outturn of 33.5mn tons 
(or 335mn quintals). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
§ 
On the investment front, we expect 
that the investment-to-GDP ratio 
will be similar to last year’s outturn, 
but with a small likely drop in private 
investment. External savings is also 
likely to be lower, consistent with a 
lower current account deficit.  
 
 
 
 
 
§ 
Our forecast of 4.1 percent GDP 
growth reflects near-zero growth in 
agriculture and expectations for 
moderate growth in industry and 
services, as covid impacts are 
gradually fading away and most 
large sub-sectors are now either 
fully/mostly re-opened (construc-
tion, airlines, public administration, 
education, health) or gradually 
recovering (tourism, hospitality).  
 
§ 
For next fiscal year, growth of 7.5 
percent is a reasonable projection, 
in 
our 
view, 
with 
conditions 
normalizing for crops and further 
recovery in industry and services.

PRICES AND INFLATION: Recent Developments and Outlook 
Inflation outturns: 
 
§ Overall inflation of 19 percent in 
January 2021 continues to be 
driven by large price increases for 
the three largest items in the CPI 
index: cereal grains (17% weight 
and 24% inflation), and housing 
and utilities (17% weight and 12% 
inflation), and vegetables (12% 
weight and 23% inflation).  
 
 
§ Specific line-items showing the 
largest inflation rates include 
cooking 
oil 
(35%), 
alcoholic 
beverages (34% due in part to 
higher excise taxes), cereal grains 
(24%), 
vegetables 
(23%) 
and 
miscellaneous 
food 
products 
(26%). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Prices and Inflation… continued: 
§ 
Focusing 
on 
this 
year’s 
persistent sources of inflation—
namely cereals, vegetables, and 
housing & utilities—there is 
some moderation in the latter 
category, whose inflation is 
now 11.5%, but still elevated 
inflation rates for cereal grains 
and vegetables.

Prices and Inflation… continued: 
§ 
As 
before, 
the 
regional 
variation in inflation continues 
to be substantial, with a 17 
percentage point gap between 
the highest and lowest regions. 
This suggests that transport and 
logistics constraints continue to 
heavily affect consumer price 
levels across regions.

inflation. This is equivalent to 
21 percent on an annualized 
basis if it were to continue at 
this monthly pace.  
 
§ 
The dominant impact of food 
price increases is apparent from 
the 2.1 percent month-on-
month increase for food prices 
versus just a 1.2 percent 
month-on-month increase for 
non-food prices.

Prices and Inflation… continued: 
§ 
With respect to the outlook for 2021, 
global prices for key commodities 
have been rising sharply in recent 
months—especially fuel, wheat, and 
sugar—and will thus keep price levels 
elevated for these imported items. We 
thus expect a lower disinflation path 
than previously projected. 
 
§ 
The February-June period of the fiscal 
year normally shows a median month-
on-month inflation rate of 1.25 
percent, per CPI data for the past 
decade. However, prices during those 
five months rose by a much higher 2.5 
percent (m-o-m) average last year, 
which will provide favorable base 
effects for year-on-year comparisons 
this year. Taking this into account, and 
utilizing average month-on-month 
price increase that are somewhat 
above the historical norm (i.e., 1.45 
percent), our inflation projections 
show near 16 percent by March 2021 
and 13 percent by June 2021.  
 
 
 
MONETARY POLICY: Recent developments and outlook 
 
Monetary growth: 
 
§ 
Reserve 
money 
growth 
has 
accelerated this past quarter, while 
broad 
money 
growth 
remains 
moderate.  The spike in reserve money 
growth may reflect temporary end-
year balance effects (linked to the 
currency conversion that ended in 
December) and it is not clear if this will 
still show up in upcoming months.

§ 
Seen over a three-year time 
frame, broad money growth 
continues to grow in line with 
its annual average growth of 
near 25 percent, while reserve 
money 
growth—at 
31 
percent—is 
substantially 
in 
excess of its recent norms.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Loans by Sector: 
 
§ 
Credit growth over the past 
year was strongest for domestic 
trade, 
export 
loans, 
and 
housing and construction loans.  
 
§ 
By 
contrast, 
below-average 
rates of loan growth are seen 
for the hotels & tourism and 
transport sectors.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bond issuance: 
 
§ 
Outstanding bond issuance has 
increased in recent quarters, 
after stabilizing somewhat in 
late 2020. The latest stock of 
outstanding SOE and Regional 
Government bond issues now 
stands at Birr 414bn, up 21 
percent from year-ago levels.

BANKING: Recent developments and outlook 
 
 
§ 
Deposit levels across both 
private and public banks have 
risen significantly, aided in part 
by the currency conversion that 
boosted cash deposits and new 
account openings in late 2020. 
 
§ 
Bank lending also continues to 
show strong growth (up 39 
percent at private banks and 25 
percent 
at 
CBE) 
despite 
expectations that covid impacts 
would reduce overall loan 
demand and restrain new bank 
lending. This reveals the high 
level of excess demand for 
credit at banks, even in the 
midst of some expected drop in 
demand from covid-affected  
sectors. 
 
 
§ 
Seen over a multi-year time 
frame, growth rates for credit 
are not that far off their recent 
averages, while deposit growth 
rates are noticeably above the 
average range seen in the past 
two years.

FISCAL POLICY: Recent developments  
 
Revenue performance 
 
§ 
Revenue performance continues 
to exceed government targets, 
with first half figures up 17 
percent from year ago levels. 
 
§ 
Despite a strong depreciation, 
there is limited (4%) growth in 
trade tax collections, reflecting 
the sharp drop in overall imports. 
The 26 percent growth in taxes 
related to domestic activity 
suggests 
expanding 
domestic 
economic activity, though one-
off gains related to recent tax 
amnesty 
measures 
may 
be 
contributing somewhat to this 
strong performance. 
 
 
FISCAL POLICY: Recent developments  
 
§ 
Viewed on a quarterly basis, Q2 
revenue (normally a seasonally 
high period of collections given 
October-December business tax 
payments) is well above post-the 
COVID lows seen during January 
to June 2020, but only 7 percent 
above revenue collections for the 
same quarter last year.

Budget performance: 
 
§ 
While only one quarter of 
budgetary performance data is 
available (to Sep 2020), the 
observed quarterly deficit of 
Birr 9bn is well below the 
annual budget figure of Birr 
126bn.  
 
§ 
Capital spending appears to be 
showing significant restraint 
(slow execution), given its 36 
percent decline vs last year 
(though this may also reflect 
lumpy spending patterns over 
the quarters).  
 
Public debt, in USD terms: 
 
§ 
Total 
public 
sector 
debt 
reached 
$54.6bn 
as 
of 
December 2020, with nearly 55 
percent 
now 
representing 
external debt.   
 
§ 
The dollar value of domestic 
public debt has shrunk slightly 
as the depreciation of the Birr 
has reduced the USD value of 
Birr-denominated debt. 
 
 
Public debt, relative to GDP: 
 
§ 
Expressed relative to GDP, 
public debt now stands at just 
51 percent of GDP (using the 
Dec 2020 debt value and 
estimated 2020-21 USD GDP).  
Even with some new debt 
accumulation to June 2021, the 
public debt to GDP ratio is likely 
to end the fiscal year at around 
52 percent of GDP.

External debt stocks 
 
§ 
External debt has trended up in 
the last two years, reflecting 
large 
loan 
disbursements 
following 
much 
stronger 
engagements with the IMF and 
World Bank.  
 
§ 
Relative to USD GDP, which will 
be roughly the same in 2020-21 
as it was in 2019-20 due to 
exchange rate effects, the debt 
ratio 
has 
moved 
upwards 
slightly from 26 percent of GDP 
two years ago to near 28 
percent of GDP at present.  
 
 External debt service 
 
§ 
Recent data on external debt 
service show $991mn in total 
principal and interest payments 
over the past six months, with 
most 
of 
this 
reflecting 
payments by state enterprises 
to mostly bilateral and private 
lenders.

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS (BOP): Recent developments  
 
 
§ 
First quarter BOP data (July-Sep 2020)  
show a much improved trade deficit 
versus the same period last year and 
also 
notably 
better 
remittance 
inflows, which are up 17 percent from 
year-ago levels.  
 
§ 
On an annual basis, the trade deficit is 
likely to end up at just under $10bn on 
current trends, and thus below 10 
percent of GDP for the first time in 
more than a decade. 
 
§ 
Reflecting these developments, the 
current account deficit in the first 
quarter fell to half its year-ago levels 
(just $729mn vs $1.4bn) 
 
§ 
In the capital account, first quarter 
trends show somewhat lower FDI           
(-10%) 
and 
much 
lower 
net 
government borrowing, both of which 
contributed to reduced total capital 
account inflows.  
 
§ 
The overall BOP deficit was limited to 
below $200mn for the quarter, 
substantially below that of the same 
period last year.

FX reserves: 
 
§ 
The NBE’s fx reserves stood at 
$3,069mn at end-December 
2020, a slight decline from the 
peak of $3,277mn seen in 
September 2020, but up from 
the $2,965mn level of a year-
ago.  
 
§ 
For commercial banks, their fx 
reserve holdings have improved 
notably throughout 2020, rising 
from $754mn at end-2019 to 
$1,107mn at end-2020.  
 
 
 
 
TRADE PERFORMANCE: Recent developments 
 
 Export performance: 
 
§ 
Overall export performance 
continues to register strong 
growth, thanks mainly to gold. 
 
§ 
Besides gold, other products 
performing 
well 
include 
oilseeds 
(recovering 
from 
previously poor performance), 
chat, electricity, and flowers.  
 
§ 
Weak performance is seen for 
coffee, pulses, textile products, 
and leather products.  
 
§ 
The 
underlying 
export 
performance so far this year is 
not as strong as suggested by 
the headline figures; non-gold 
exports are down 4 percent 
versus the same period last 
year.

Import performance: 
 
§ A major drop in imports is being seen across 
virtually all key categories—including for 
raw materials (-14%), fuel (-37%), capital 
goods (-17%), and durable consumer goods 
(-22%). 
 
§ A sharp exchange rate depreciation is the 
most likely explanation for this across-the-
board drop, although some product-
specific factors (lower oil prices before their 
recent spike) are also likely an important 
contributor.   
 
§ Looking ahead, large increases in recent 
global commodity prices will partly reverse 
the sharp import decline of the last six 
months. This explains our projection for a 5 
percent drop in imports for the full year 
(2020-21), versus the 10 percent decline 
seen so far in the fiscal year. Most notably, 
global oil prices are up 35 percent from 
year-ago levels (near $62 per barrel now vs 
$46 per barrel a year-ago), while food 
prices (as captured by FAO’s food price 
index) are up 16 percent from year-ago 
levels and at multi-year highs for many 
items such as wheat, cooking oil, and sugar. 
 
 
 
§ Capital goods imports are also down 
substantially from year-ago levels across 
virtually 
all 
key 
categories 
(except 
agricultural-related capital goods, which 
are a small sub-category).

EXCHANGE RATE: Recent developments and outlook 
 
 
§ 
After moving at an average rate of 
60 cents per month for 2020, the 
exchange rate has reach Birr 39.44 
as of January 2021 versus 32.06 a 
year-ago 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
§ 
As 
expected, 
the 
rate 
of 
depreciation has moderated in 
recent months, and is now showing 
a 23 percent depreciation from 
year-ago levels versus a 28 percent 
depreciation in November 2020.

§ 
The gap between the official and 
parallel market rates had declined 
somewhat in the second half of 2020 
but has reverted back to its average 
range of between 25-30 percent as 
of early 2021.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Exchange rate developments and outlook:  
 
§ 
For the period ahead, we expect no 
major change in the fx regime and 
thus anticipate the central bank to 
continue using a gradual exchange 
rate crawl in managing the currency.  
 
§ 
We expect the pace of adjustment 
this year will be slower given 
declining inflation and improving 
balance of payments conditions.  
 
§ 
With the central bank likely to focus 
on avoiding a real appreciation of 
the Birr, we expect the Birr will 
depreciate by at most 15 percent 
over the course of 2021, compared 
to a 23 percent drop seen in 2020. 
This translates into a Birr level of 
near 42 per USD by June 2020 and 
near 44 per USD by December 2020.
