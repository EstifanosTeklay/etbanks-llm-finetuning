Your Excellences, Distinguished Shareholders, 
Honorable Guests,
 Ladies and Gentlemen!! 
It gives me a great pleasure to welcome 
you all, on behalf of the Board of Directors 
and on my own behalf to the 28th Awash 
Bank’s Shareholders’ Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) of the FY 2022/23. I also 
feel very privileged to extend my deepest 
appreciation to our honored shareholders 
and all other stakeholders for the 
unshakable backing, continued trust and 
support provided to enable Awash Bank 
to score again another astound result in 
all of the major banking operations that 
proven its leadership among the private 
banks of the country during the year under 
review. I am also confident that this multi-
dimensional support from all stakeholders 
will also continue to make the Bank 
remain the pioneer leading private bank 
as well as realizing of its future aspiration 
of becoming One of the Top Ten Banks in 
Africa in the coming years.     
Awash Bank is entrusted with the task of 
upholding & maintaining good corporate 
governance in order to safeguard the 
interests of its shareholders, customers 
and the employees. The Bank is governed 
by twelve Board of Directors elected by 
the General Assembly of the Shareholders 
and the Management Team, that is led 
by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at 
the top. With these compositions, Awash 
Bank corroborated a continued progress 
in building a stronger and safer Bank that 
is capable of delivering higher revenues 
to its shareholders.  Particularly, over the 
past twelve years, the Bank has recorded 
an incredible result that has certified an 
augmented income and Earnings Per Share 
(EPS), with a track record of creating a 
significant value for its investors.    
The overall situation indicates that the 
world economy during the FY 2022/23 was 
characterized by severe headwinds amid 
weak growth prospects, elevated inflation 
and geopolitical challenges particularly, 
to the banking industry, with disrupted 
livelihoods, subdued investments and 
uncertainties. The major factors include, 
the effects of the COVID 19 pandemic, 
the protracted war in Ukraine, the ever 
worsening impacts of climate change 
and the rapidly shifting macro-economic 
conditions. According to the World 
Bank’s latest Global Economic Prospects 
Report, the global growth is projected 
to decelerate from 3.1 percent in 2022 
to 2.1 percent in 2023 with prospects 
clouded by financial risk.  
Domestically, the Ethiopian economy 
in the FY 2022/23 faced rigorous 
macro-economic challenges, including 
persistently high inflation, insufficient 
foreign currency reserves, sharp fall in 
donor financing and depreciation of the 
national currency.  
BOARD CHAIRMAN’S 
MESSAGE 
GURE KUMSSA
Board Chairman
ANNUAL REPORT // 2022/23
4
In the FY 2022/23, the country registered 
an average inflation rate of 33.6 percent 
due to rise in food prices, exacerbated 
by drought and internal conflict that 
complicated the domestic supply chain. 
Regardless of the above impediments, 
however, the year for Awash Bank was 
grateful, enabling the Bank to operate 
efficiently and once again record a 
praiseworthy result.
The major and key financial and non-
financial highlights for the year ended 
June 30, 2023 can be summarized as 
under:
•	 The aggregate deposit increased by 23 
percent from last year same period and 
reached Birr 187.37 billion including 
L/C margin and deposit from IFB,
•	 Loans and Advances surged up by 25 
percent as compared to last year same 
period and reached Birr 161.95 billion,
•	 Total income of the Bank escalated by 
39 percent from last year same period 
and arrived at Birr 28.79 billion,
•	 The total expense of the Bank stood at 
Birr 19.05 billion as at June 30, 2023, 
up by 44 percent from previous year 
similar period,   
•	 The gross profit grew by 30.8 percent 
over previous year and reached Birr 
9.75 billion, as at end of June 2023,
•	 Total foreign currency generated 
during the year stood at USD 1.46 
billion, 
surpassing 
the 
amount 
generated last year same period by 
USD 248.2 million or 17 percent, 
•	 The aggregate deposit customer base 
rose to 10.4 million up by 34 percent 
from last year similar period,
•	 The branch network as at June 30, 
2023 reached 875 showing a growth by 
21 percent,    
•	 Agents, POSs, ATMs and Merchants/
Billers have shown a growth of 198%, 
5%, 77% and 152%, respectively, as 
compared to last year same period, 
•	 The volume and the value of digital 
banking transactions have increased 
by 176 percent and 518 percent, 
respectively, when compared to last 
year same period.
The growth registered by the Bank in 
the major banking operations marked 
a historic year among the private banks 
and also in Awash Bank itself, reflecting 
how much the business of the Bank is 
strengthened. 
The major causes for the delightful 
outcome of the Bank during the year 
are the efforts exerted in the resource 
mobilization activities & the continuous 
hard work applied in the collection of 
repayments of loans & advances resulting 
to a significant reduction of the Non-
Performing Loans (NPLs) to less than one 
percent as at June 30, 2023.
The overall success of the Bank, however, 
is coiled on the wise guidance of the 
Board of Directors, the prudent and 
coordinated quality leadership of the 
CEO, the dedication and the hardworking 
commitment 
of 
the 
Management 
Members, the immense and unreserved 
contribution of the entire employees and 
the overall strong endeavors made by the 
Bank-wide community to maximize the 
wallet share of the Bank that deserves a 
an honorary recognition. 
In another phenomenon, although, the 
year was full of challenges, it is worth 
mentioning to raise one miraculous 
victory which the Bank enjoyed during 
the year under review. This surprising 
triumph was that a well-known world-
wide Financial Magazine known by the 
name ‘’Global Finance Magazine’’ has 
chosen Awash Bank, for the second time, 
as the Best Bank of Ethiopia in the fiscal 
year 2022/23.  In recognition of this 
particular selection, an award was given 
to the Bank during the IMF/World Bank 
Group Annual Meeting of the FY 2022/23, 
ANNUAL REPORT // 2022/23
5
held at Morocco, Marrakech, from October 
9 up to 15, 2023.   On the other hand, 
Awash Bank has been recognized by the 
SME Financial Forum with an Honorable 
Mention in the best SME financier category 
of the Global SME Finance Award of 2023 
from Africa. The award was given to the 
Bank for the outstanding achievements 
in delivering exceptional products and 
service to its SME clients. The event was 
held in Mumbai, India, in the presence of 
over 700 participants from more than 70 
countries.      
At this historic step, it should be noted 
that the Board is always committed to 
ensuring that Awash Bank is a robust 
organization with a focus on long-term 
value creation for its shareholders. In this 
regard, the concrete and swift actions 
taken by the Board in consultation 
with the Management during the year 
for fundamental changes & ensuring 
sustainable & profitable growth through 
excellence in operation, technology & 
ultimately customer satisfaction have all 
contributed to the success of the Bank.  
Additionally, during the year under 
review, the Bank was embarked on 
various strategic initiatives, such as 
Developing of New Corporate Strategy, IT 
and Building Projects. In the Corporate 
Strategy Development studied by a 
well-known 
international 
consultant, 
McKinsey & Co., the Bank replaced the 
previous ‘’Vision 2025’’ by a new ‘’Vision 
2030’’ which is aspiring to be ‘’One of 
the Top Ten African Banks by the Year 
2030”. The implementation of the new 
transformational journey has commenced 
starting from the first quarter of the FY 
2023/24. 
Similarly, to make the future IT Platform 
more 
user-friendly 
for 
its 
clients 
and 
also 
to 
go abreast along with the unprecedented 
surge in the digitalization of financial 
services, the Bank has reviewed the 
status of its present Core Banking System 
(CBS) and is moving to replace it with a 
ground breaking technology. The Bank, in 
addition, has also identified the Fintech 
Companies with whom to work by focusing 
on enhanced digital capabilities, since 
these are the fundamental part of the 
banking innovations and remain the major 
area of investment for a Bank to be able 
to provide faster, safer, secured and more 
convenient banking facilities and services 
for enhancing customer satisfaction and 
sustained growth for the Bank.
In strengthening of its asset base, the Bank 
is also moving forward in the construction 
of its own buildings at the strategic areas 
of the country.
In line with Human Resource Policies and 
Practices, the Bank focuses on attracting, 
motivating and retaining qualified and 
skilled manpower. The Board believes 
that having a motivated workforce & a 
sound governance & risk management are 
pivotal to attaining the sustainable growth 
and the vision that the Bank aspires for. In 
this regard, the Bank has recently crafted 
new structural organization that enables 
it to attract, motivate and retain qualified 
and skilled manpower. Concomitant with 
this, steps were also taken to improve 
staff productivity, focusing on optimizing 
the existing resource through internal job 
postings, transfers and skill enhancement 
initiatives.
Regarding the capital structure, the 
strategic growth aspiration of the Bank, 
which is to become one of the top ten 
Banks in Africa by the year 2030, has to 
be backed by a solid capital base. On 
top of that, the capital adequacy ratio 
of the Bank should also comfortably be 
above the regulatory requirement and 
should provide strong foundation for the 
company. It is worth mentioning that the 
growth of the Bank itself involves capital 
growth.  Therefore, in consideration of 
the above points, the Bank’s Shareholders 
at its 27th AGM has approved a new paid 
up capital of Birr 43 billion as proposed 
by the Board and the Management.  The 
ANNUAL REPORT // 2022/23
6
payment of the new paid up capital is 
under progress to maintain the Bank with 
a strong capital position for the coming 
years.     
In the way forward, I want to stress that 
the Board and the Management are still 
audacious to work hard during the FY 
2023/24, striving to take the advantage 
of 
the 
resilient 
macroeconomic 
fundamentals to drive its business growth, 
despite of the fierce competition amongst 
Banks, the persistence of the impacts 
of costs of living and instability in some 
parts of the country. Given the dedication 
of the Board, the Management Team, and 
the competency of the entire employees, 
the attainment of the new vision 2030, 
which is becoming ‘’One of the Top Ten 
African Banks by 2030’’ for Awash Bank 
is inevitable. The Bank will continue to 
deliver on its strategic commitments, 
which drive the operational performances 
and create values for its shareholders as 
well as the communities at large.     
Besides its corporate objectives, the 
contribution of the Bank to the growth of 
the national economy and the wellbeing 
of its citizens during the FY 2022/23 
is attention-grabbing. The annual tax 
paid, the financial support made for 
the national development projects such 
as ‘’Gebeta Letiwlid’’ and the various 
financial supports given to the displaced 
& disaster affected victims are some to 
be mentioned.  During the year under 
review, Awash Bank has provided more 
than Birr 300 million as the fulfillment 
of its Corporate Social Responsibilities 
(CSR).
In conclusion, on behalf of the Board of 
Directors, let me take this opportunity 
to express my deep sense of gratitude 
to all shareholders, loyal customers and 
the public at large for their firm and 
indispensable support and the confidence 
they have on our Bank. I solicit continued 
support from the valued partakers and 
renewed commitment to work with the 
Bank in our journey forward.  
My special thank goes to the Management 
Members and the  entire employees 
for their passion and commitment, 
belongingness and hard work to elevate 
the position of their Bank, in delivering 
commendable results and enabling the 
Bank to maintain its leading position 
among the private commercial banks in 
the country. I would also like to commend 
the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) 
for rendering our Bank a constructive 
guidance and wholehearted support. 
Finally, recalling that the Bank has come 
a long way so far, and has still a long 
way to go, I want to assure you that your 
Bank has put appropriate plans, policies 
and strategies to achieve growth with 
quality, stability and profitability in the 
years to come. To this end, our Bank will 
strongly scrutinize the laid down new 
vision and strategy of ‘’Conquering the 
New Frontiers’’ and to bring about further 
excellence by exploiting opportunities and 
vigilantly withstanding the challenging 
environment.  
Thank You!

I feel proud and pleased to congratulate 
all respected Shareholders, Board of 
Directors, all Management and the entire 
hard-working staff members and above 
all, most respected and valued customers 
of the Bank on the magnificent and 
unparalleled financial and non-financial 
performance registered by our Bank for 
the financial year ended June 30, 2023. 
All other stakeholders of the Bank also 
deserve due recognition and appreciation 
for the performance registered during the 
financial year.
The financial year 2022/23 was challenging. 
As per the Federal Government’s official 
report, in the budget year just ended, the 
nation-wide total revenue generated from 
export was USD 3.64 Billion while the plan 
was USD 5.21 Billion, which is less by USD 
1.5 Billion (31.8%). The drop in the value 
of global commodity prices, illegal trade, 
security issues, suspension from African 
Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), 
etc… were some of the factors that have 
contributed 
to 
slow-down 
of 
export 
earnings nation-wide.
Domestically, the security issue, especially 
in the northern and western part of the 
country, has been seriously affecting 
the national economy in general and the 
banking business in particular. Nation-
wide, the inflation rate for food and non-
food items has been above 30% over the 
past one year and this also escalated our 
day-to-day operational expenses.

Apart from the above, the banking industry 
was faced with other formidable challenges 
whose impact on business in general was 
substantial. However, our Bank has been 
able to withstand the challenges by putting 
in place different strategies to sustain 
our business and at the same time to 
satisfactorily address the expectations of 
our shareholders.
During the year just ended, with a 
concerted effort of all, our Bank was 
able to dig deeper to exploit all available 
business opportunities so as to sustain its 
leadership position.  The below were some 
of our strengths and success stories that 
enabled us to vibrantly emerge as a leading 
performer in the industry.
1.	 As 
indicated 
herein 
above, 
total 
commodity export in the 2022/23 
financial year generated USD 3.64 
Billion. From the total export revenue, 
agricultural export constitutes 79%, 
manufacturing 11.7%, mineral 6.9% and 
others 3%. Of the total export items, 
coffee remained the most valuable item 
generating around 1.3 Billion dollars. As 
a result of tremendous effort exerted 
by all, the foreign currency generated 
by our Bank from export business as 
well as from other sources was USD 1.49 
Billion against USD 1.24 Billion of last 
year same period. 
2.	 A 
number 
of 
Memorandum 
of 
Understanding (MoU) has been signed 
with various local and international 
organizations during the year and some 
of them have been channeling a good 
sum of both local and hard currencies 
through our Bank.
3.	 Customers’ Week of the Bank under 
the motto, “We Strive to Delight Our 
Customers” was successfully celebrated 
for one week from April 24 up to 
April 29, 2023. The celebration of the 
program ushered our commitment to 
serving our customers with due care 
and conscientiousness.  
4.	 As a result of an impressive performance 
of our Bank in deposits, loans and 
advances, assets, profit, capital, branch 
network, customer base expansion, 
product innovation and digital banking 
activities, our Bank has been selected 
for the second time by Global Finance 
as Ethiopian Best Bank 2023. The award 
was given during the World Bank Summit 
in October 2023 in Morocco, Marrakech. 
No doubt, the award will enhance the 
reputation of our Bank world-wide.
5.	 Our Bank has received recognition in 
Global Small and Medium Enterprises 
(SMEs) Finance 
Awards for the 2023 Year! 
This year’s Global SME Finance Awards, 
which recognizes financial institutions 
and 
fintech 
companies 
for 
their 
outstanding achievements in delivering 
exceptional products and services to 
their SME clients, was held in Mumbai, 
India in the presence of participants 
from more than 70 countries.
Awash Bank was recognized by the 
SME Finance Forum with an Honorable 
Mention in the Best SME Financier 
category of the Global SME Finance 
Awards 2023 from Africa.
6.	 The 
second 
phase 
of 
an 
Entrepreneurship 
Competition coined under the name 
Tatariwochu/ 
Qaxaleewwan 
was 
launched for the second time with a 
primary objective of empowering the 
visionaries. The project will provide 
training, business development support 
and access to finance for entrepreneurs 
with innovative and problem-solving 
business ideas and the project is 
expected to play its role in nation-
building activities.
All 
in 
all, 
exploiting 
the 
available 
opportunities and competently confronting 
the 
challenges, 
our 
Bank, 
with 
a 
coordinated 
effort of all, has performed extremely 
well this year also. Accordingly, the profit 
before tax stood at Birr 9.8 Billion from Birr 
7.4 Billion of last year same period; i.e. 
Birr 2.3 Billion or 31% growth. This is the 
ANNUAL REPORT // 2022/23
18
highest profit before tax ever registered in 
our Bank as well as in the history of private 
banks. 
The paid-up capital has reached Birr 14.6 
Billion from Birr 10.2 Billion of last year 
same period; that is, an increment of Birr 
4.4 Billion or 42%. In spite of the capital 
increment, however, the pace of the growth 
of profit was even higher and as a result, 
the registered earnings per share (EPS) was 
Birr 577 in 2022/23 as compared to Birr 570 
of the preceding year for a par value of Birr 
1,000 which, I believe, is attractive and 
lucrative to the shareholders of the Bank.
As a result of intensified operation of the 
Bank and inflationary situation for goods 
and services, among others, total expense 
of the Bank, including interest expense, 
has surged from Birr 13.2 Billion in 2022 
to Birr 19.1 Billion in 2023. Of the total 
expense items, personnel expense, interest 
expense, and other operating expenses 
took the highest share in their order, as has 
been the case in the preceding years.
Total deposit, including L/C Margin, as at 
June 30, 2023 stood at Birr 187.4 Billion 
and that was the highest deposit balance 
registered in our Bank as well as in the 
history of private banks. The deposit 
balance grew by Birr 35.4 Billion or 23% in 
2023 as compared to 2022.
Total asset remarkably grew from Birr 
183.1 Billion in 2022 to Birr 224.0 Billion 
in 2023; i.e. a growth of Birr 40.9 Billion or 
22.3%, and that was the highest figure by 
all standards. Loans and advances took the 
biggest share of the total asset, accounting 
for Birr 162.0 Billion or 72% of the total 
asset of the Bank. 
With a concerted effort to maintain the 
asset quality of the Bank, the NPLs ratio as 
at June 30, 2023 stood at about 1% and this 
was far below the threshold, i.e. 5%, set by 
the regulatory body. This insignificant ratio 
in comparison with the total loan portfolio 
is not as such a concerning issue but still 
all possible effort will be exerted to keep it 
even at the lowest possible limit.
Our Bank has opened 150 branches in the 
financial year and the total number of 
branches nation-wide as at end of June 
2023 reached 875.
Despite many ups and downs, the financial 
year 2022/23 was an impressive and 
successful year in many respects to the 
banking industry in general and to our Bank 
in particular. Some of the major success 
stories of our Bank which will enable us to 
perform even better in the year to come 
are the following:
1.	 Our Bank has successfully concluded 
its contractual agreement with an 
internationally 
renowned 
strategy 
development 
company, 
McKinsey 
and Company, for the development 
of 
a 
corporate 
strategy. 
The 
recommendations of the consulting 
company 
are 
now 
fully 
under 
implementation. A new organization 
structure is also in place to enable our 
Bank fully implement the recommended 
strategies. It’s our strong conviction 
that the new corporate strategy will 
enhance the competitive position of our 
Bank in the future.
2.	 Measures are being undertaken by the 
Federal Government to address the 
existing double-digit inflation rate for 
food and non-food items in the year 
2023/24 and beyond.  This is expected 
to somehow ameliorate the various 
running costs and the profitability of 
the Bank.
3.	 A number of new local banks have 
joined the banking industry in the fiscal 
year. Lack of competition has never 
been good – ever! With competition, 
winners survive, losers don’t. Thus, the 
coming of new banks will drive us to 
ANNUAL REPORT // 2022/23
19
think deeply, creatively and differently 
and finally come up with new ideas for 
the good of the general public at large.
The 
year 
2023/24 
is, 
nevertheless, 
expected to be challenging owing to the 
following factors:
i.	 The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) 
has set a credit ceiling limit on banks 
for the year 2023/24. This decision of 
the central bank will have a significant 
impact on interest income that will be 
generated from loans and advances and 
an immediate impact on the profitability 
of the Bank.
ii.	 Both local and foreign private financial 
service companies have been provided 
a mobile money service license by the 
regulatory body. New conventional 
and interest free banks have also been 
provided a license to join the banking 
industry. Business will not, therefore, 
be as usual and we expect stiffer 
competition in the years ahead.
iii.	The 
annual 
premium 
contribution 
to the newly established Ethiopian 
Deposit Insurance Fund is becoming 
an unexpected expense to member 
financial institutions and the premium 
contribution is escalating the expenses 
of banks.
I am, however, very hopeful and confident 
that with a coordinated effort of all, Awash 
will further flourish and become vibrantly 
visible by overcoming the challenges. I 
believe that with a renewed commitment, 
we can do even better by fully utilizing 
our potentials and exploiting the available 
opportunities. To this end, we will plan 
every time in advance to get the right 
things done at the right time as the six 
‘P’ formula goes, ‘proper prior planning 
prevents poor performance!  
Taking this opportune moment, I would like 
to extend my deepest appreciation once 
again to our customers for their loyalty, and 
dedicated Management and hard-working 
staff members for the best performance 
registered in 2022/23.
Lastly, I would also like to extend my 
heartfelt gratitude to all Shareholders, 
Board of Directors, our Correspondent 
Banks, Federal and Regional Government 
Offices and especially the National Bank of 
Ethiopia and Financial Intelligence Center 
for their relentless support, advice and 
guidance in all our day-to-day activities. 
God bless you all!

REPORT OF THE 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board of Directors of Awash Bank is pleased 
to present Awash Bank’s Annual Report and 
Audited Financial Statements for the financial 
year 2022/23 to the 28th Annual General Meeting 
of its valued Shareholders.
Financial Year 2022/23 witnessed both global 
and domestic challenges. At the global front, 
the main challenges were the slowdown of the 
world economic growth, high level of inflation, 
tightened monetary and financial conditions 
and disruptions in supply chain, owing to the 
lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and 
the protracted Russia-Ukraine war. 
On the domestic front, the Ethiopian economy 
was challenged by, among others, drought, 
continued internal conflicts in some parts of the 
country, double digit inflation and shortages of 
foreign currency. 
In addition to global and domestic challenges, 
banks operating in Ethiopia have faced intense 
competition from existing and new entrant 
banks as well as from non-bank players such 
as Fintech companies and Telecom operators. 
It is worth mentioning that the number of 
commercial banks operating in Ethiopia has 
reached over 30 by the end of June 2023, half 
of which were the newly entrant ones during 
the last two years. Similarly, Ethio-Telecom and 
a number of Fintech companies have started 
engaging in payment services, which was 
previously allowed only for banks.
Despite these headwinds impacting the overall 
performances and profitability of banks, Awash 
Bank has once again registered an outstanding 
operational 
and 
financial 
results 
during 
the financial year 2022/23. Indeed, Awash 
Bank maintained its leading position in key 
performance areas such as total deposits, loans 
and advances, total assets and profits, among 
the private banks operating in Ethiopia.
1.	 OPERATIONAL 
PERFORMANCES
1.1	 Deposits Mobilization 
Awash Bank’s total deposits, including L/C 
margin and deposits from the Interest Free 
Banking (IFB) reached Birr 187.4 billion as at 
June 30, 2023, picked-up by Birr 35.4 billion 
(23 percent) over the preceding year. The 
Bank’s notable and sustainable deposit growth 
is attributed to a number of factors, including 
the expansion of the customer base of the 
Bank, offering of various deposit products and 
services and expansion of both conventional 
and digital service delivery channels.

The Bank’s asset quality, as measured by the 
ratio of non-performing loans, is one of the 
best in the industry. The Non-Performing-
Loans (NPLs) ratio of the Bank stood at about 
one percent,  which is by far below the NBE’s 
(regulatory) threshold level of 5 percent. This 
commendable performance is the result of the 
concerted and consistent efforts of the Bank in 
maintaining high asset quality.

International Banking 	 	
      Services
Generation of foreign currency and facilitation 
of international trade are the main activities 
of the Bank pertaining to international banking 
services. Accordingly, the total amount of 
foreign exchange earned during the financial 
year 2022/23 reached USD 1.49 billion, which 
is a record high performance as compared 
with both previous years’ performances and 
the performances of all other private banks 
operating in Ethiopia.  This was also a 20% 
increase (USD 244 Million) compared with last 
year. 
This notably high performance is mainly 
attributed to efforts made to attract and 
retain exporters and other FCY generating 
companies. 
The establishment of strategic partnerships 
with several international organizations and 
religious institutions and the Bank’s well-
earned reputation from correspondent banks 
for honoring its obligations have also played 
a significant role for the registered high 
performance in generating foreign currency 
during the review period.  
Awash Bank has also continued to play a 
significant role in facilitating global trade by 
providing a variety of trade finance services 
to importers and exporters. Accordingly, the 
outstanding loans and advances availed to the 
export sector has reached Birr 31 billion by the 
end of June 2023, while loans and advances 
extended to the importers stood at Birr 20.8 
billion during the same period.

1.4	 Total Assets 
Awash Bank has shown a vibrant financial 
intermediation activity as reflected by a surge 
in its total assets. The total asset size of the 
Bank has crossed a Br. 200 billion mark for 
the first time in the history of private banks 
in Ethiopia.  During the FY 2022/23, the 
total assets of the Bank has increased by Birr 
40.9 billion (22.3 percent) and reached Birr 
224 billion, which will apparently be a good 
springboard for the envisioned growth and 
expansion of the Bank. This growth was mainly 
driven by the growth in loans and advances, 
as well as investments on fixed assets. The 
growth in the asset position of the Bank was 
largely funded by deposits from customers, 
which accounted for over 83 percent of the 
total assets.
Figure 3: Trends in Total Assets 
(In Billions of Birr)
1.5	 Capital
Following the Shareholders’ decision at the 
17th Extraordinary Meeting held in November 
2022 to raise the paid-up capital of the Bank 
to Birr 55 billion within four years, the paid-
up capital of the Bank has increased by Birr 
4.4 billion (42 percent) during the reporting 
period and reached Birr 14.6 billion at the end 
of June, 2023. This strategic decision will allow 
the Bank to expand its operations, invest in 
new technologies, provide better services to 
its customers and ultimately allow Awash Bank 
to ensure its leadership position in all aspects 
of the competition. 
Awash Bank is not only the most well capitalized 
private bank in Ethiopia, but also the Bank 
whose paid-up capital is well in excess of 
the minimum statutory requirement of Birr 5 
billion set by the NBE, which all commercial 
banks operating in Ethiopia are required to 
meet by June 30, 2026.  
2.	 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Awash Bank has registered superior financial 
performances during the review period 
not 
withstanding 
challenging 
business 
environments and difficult macro-economic 
conditions such as high inflation and shortage 
of foreign currency.

2.1	 Income
Total income of the Bank increased by Birr 8.2 
billion (39.8 percent) over the previous year’s 
performance and reached Birr 28.79 billion 
during the financial year 2022/23, which was 
largely driven by a surge in interest income. 
Accordingly, interest income was increased 
by 54.9 percent and reached Birr 21.9 billion, 
owing to a significant increase in loans and 
advances.  Similarly, fees and commission 
income grew by 13 percent and reached 
Birr 5.6 billion during the review period. 
Meanwhile, income from other operating 
income decreased by 17 percent and stood at 
Birr 1.3 billion during the financial year under 
review. This registered decline in operating 
income is mainly due to the decline in gain on 
foreign currency transactions and translations.

income is mainly due to the decline in gain on foreign currency transactions and translations.  
Interest income accounted for the largest portion of the overall income (76 percent), followed by 
fees and commissions (19 percent) and other operational income (4 percent).

and reached Birr 21.9 billion, owing to a significant increase in loans and advances.  Similarly, 
fees and commission income grew by 13 percent and reached Birr 5.6 billion during the review 
period. Meanwhile, income from other operating income decreased by 17 percent and stood at 
Birr 1.3 billion during the financial year under review. This registered decline in operating 
income is mainly due to the decline in gain on foreign currency transactions and translations.

To the Awash Bank Board of Directors, all stakeholders and depositors: 
In compliance with the duties and responsibilities vested on us in the Bank's Shariah Advis
Committee Charter and the letter of appointment thereafter, we are required to ensure t

In our opinion, generally, we, the Shariah Advisory Committee of Awash Bank, do hereby 
confirm that:
•	 The IFB Products mentioned above, operational procedures, contracts, transactions 
and dealings entered into by the Bank during the year ended 30 June 2023 that we have 
reviewed are in compliance with the Shariah principles and the Shariah rulings related 
to IFB operations.
•	 Mudarabah deposits and financing (Profit-Loss Sharing) is not yet started and thus, 
there is no allocation of profit and charging of losses relating to investment accounts.
•	 The profits generated by the Bank from Murabaha and other services like Kafalah, are 
Shariah-compliant and there are no earnings that have been realized from sources 
prohibited by the Shariah principles and thus, no fund is expected to be disposed to 
charitable causes from the Bank’s profit. However, ETB 53,821,187.95 was collected 
from defaulted customers in the form of penalty which must be given to charity is line 
with the Shariah principle. 
To ensure the objective utilization of the Charity Account, the SAC has adopted 
comprehensive guidelines. These guidelines outline the criteria for selecting eligible 
beneficiaries, the types of projects that qualify for funding, and the evaluation process 
for assessing the impact and feasibility of proposed initiatives. By adhering to these 
guidelines, Awash Bank Ikhlas ensures that funds are utilized effectively and in line with 
Shariah Principles.
We appreciate the progress made in the utilization of charity fund and we are pleased 
to report the completion of the following projects: Additional delivery rooms at Wolkite 
Hasan Injamo Clinic, & Building of a school block in South Wollo, Bistima Town. We are also 
happy to report that the building of a school block in the war-torn areas of North Wollo is 
well underway. These projects will make a significant difference in the lives of people by 
providing them with access to essential healthcare and education.
We recommend that the Bank continue to engage with the Shariah Advisory Committee on 
a regular basis to ensure that its IFB products and services remain Shariah-compliant. We 
also recommend that the Bank continue to invest in training and development for its staff 
on Interest Free Banking principles and practices.
Shukran! (Thank You)

Board Chairman
Chief Executive Officer
26 October 2023
The Bank's Board of Directors are of the opinion that the financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Bank and its financial performance. 
The Board of Directors further accept responsibility for the maintenance of accounting records that may be relied
upon in the preparation of financial statements, as well as adequate systems of internal financial control.
Nothing has come to the attention of the Board of Directors to indicate that the Bank will not remain as a going
concern for at least twelve months from the date of this statement.
The Bank's Board of Directors accept responsibility for the annual financial statements, which have been prepared
using appropriate accounting policies supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
In accordance with the Banking Business Proclamation No. 592/2008, the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) may direct
the Bank to prepare financial statements, whether their designation changes or they are replaced, from time to
time. Also, the Financial Reporting Proclamation No. 847/2014 requires the Bank to prepare its financial statements 
in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 
The Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as management
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Bank is required to keep such records as are necessary to:
Exhibit clearly and correctly the state of its affairs;
Explain its transactions and financial position; and
Enable the National Bank to determine whether the Bank had complied with the provisions of the Banking
Business Proclamation and regulations and directives issued for the implementation of the aforementioned
Proclamation. 
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and are
based upon appropriate accounting policies and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates.

2.1 Introduction to summary of significant accounting policies
2.2 Basis of preparation
Awash Bank S.C. ("Awash Bank or the Bank") is a private commercial bank domiciled in Ethiopia. The Bank was
established in November 1994, in accordance with the provisions of the Commercial Code of Ethiopia of 1960
and the Licensing and Supervision of Banking Business Proclamation No. 592/2008. The Bank's registered office
is at:
The Bank is principally engaged in the provision of diverse range of financial products and services to
corporate, retail and SME clients base in Ethiopian market.
Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2023 have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
("IASB"). Additional information required by National regulations is included where appropriate. 
The financial statements comprise the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the
statement of financial position, the statement of changes in equity, the statement of cash flows and the notes
to the financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern principle under the
historical cost concept, except for the following;
•    defined benefit pension plans – plan assets measured at fair value.
•    Equity investments which is measured at fair value.
All values are rounded to the nearest thousand, except when otherwise indicated. The financial statements
are presented in thousands of Ethiopian Birr (ETB' 000).
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Bank’s
accounting policies. Changes in assumptions may have a significant impact on the financial statements in the
period the assumptions changed. Management believes that the underlying assumptions are appropriate and
that the Bank's financial statements, therefore, present the financial position and results fairly. The areas
involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant 
to the financial statements, are disclosed in Note 3.

2.2.1 Going concern
2.2.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
New Standards, amendments, interpretations
New Standards, amendments, interpretations effective and adopted during the year.
Amendments to IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’: Proceeds before Intended Use
 Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2021 Cycle.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – clarifies which fees should be included in the 10% test for derecognition of
financial liabilities. This change did not have an impact on the Bank’s financial statements.
IFRS 16 Leases – amendment to remove the illustration of payments from the lessor relating to leasehold
improvements, to remove any confusion about the treatment of lease incentives. This change did not have an
impact on the Bank’s financial statements.
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Basis of preparation (Continued)
The amendment to IAS 16 prohibits an entity from deducting from the cost of an item of PPE any proceeds
received from selling items produced while the entity is preparing the asset for its intended use (for example,
the proceeds from selling samples produced when testing a machine to see if it is functioning properly). The
proceeds from selling such items, together with the costs of producing them, are recognised in profit or loss.
The amendment clarifies which costs an entity includes in assessing whether a contract will be loss-making.
This assessment is made by considering unavoidable costs, which are the lower of the net cost of exiting the
contract and the costs to fulfil the contract. The amendment clarifies the meaning of ‘costs to fulfil a
contract’. Under the amendment, costs to fulfil a contract include incremental costs and the allocation of
other costs that relate directly to fulfilling the contract.
Amendments to IAS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’ on Onerous 
Contracts—Cost of Fulfilling a Contract
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The management have no doubt that 
the Bank would remain in existence after 12 months.
New Standards, amendments, interpretations issued but not adopted.
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts
IFRS 17 requires a current measurement model where estimates are remeasured in each reporting period.
Contracts are measured using the building blocks of:

2.2.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures (Continued)
The amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes require companies to recognise deferred tax on transactions that, on
initial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences. They will
typically apply to transactions such as leases of lessees and decommissioning obligations and will require the
recognition of additional deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current – Amendments to IAS 1
The narrow-scope amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements clarify that liabilities are
classified as either current or non- current, depending on the rights that exist at the end of the reporting
period. Classification is unaffected by the expectations of the entity or events after the reporting date (e.g.,
the receipt of a waver or a breach of covenant). The amendments also clarify what IAS 1 means when it refers
to the ‘settlement’ of a liability. The amendments could affect the classification of liabilities, particularly for
entities that previously considered management’s intentions to determine classification and for some
liabilities that can be converted into equity. The standard effective on or after 1 January 2023.
Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2)
The IASB amended IAS 1 to require entities to disclose their material rather than their significant accounting
policies. The amendments define what is ‘material accounting policy information’ and explain how to identify
when accounting policy information is material. They further clarify that immaterial accounting policy
information does not need to be disclosed. If it is disclosed, it should not obscure material accounting
information. The standard effective on or after 1 January 2023. 
Definition of Accounting Estimates- Amendments to IAS 8
The amendment to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors clarifies how
companies should distinguish changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. The
distinction is important, because changes in accounting estimates are applied prospectively to future
transactions and future events, whereas changes in accounting policies are generally applied retrospectively
to past transactions and other past events as well as the current period. The standard effective on or after 1
January 2023. 
which is recognised as revenue over the coverage period. The standard allows a choice between recognising
changes in discount rates either in the statement of profit or loss or directly in other comprehensive income.
An optional, simplified premium allocation approach is permitted for the liability for the remaining coverage
for short duration contracts, which are often written by non-life insurers.
There is a modification of the general measurement model called the ‘variable fee approach’ for certain
contracts written by life insurers where policyholders share in the returns from underlying items. When
applying the variable fee approach, the entity’s share of the fair value changes of the underlying items is
included in the CSM. The results of insurers using this model are therefore likely to be less volatile than under
the general model. The standard effective annual period beginning on or after 1 January 2023.

policies and disclosures 
Other Standards
2.3 Investment in associates 
The statement of profit or loss reflects the Bank’s share of the results of operations of the associate. Any
change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Bank’s OCI. In addition, when there has been a
change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the Bank recognises its share of any changes, when
applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions
between the Bank and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.
After application of the equity method, the Bank determines whether it is necessary to recognise an
impairment loss on its investment in its associate. At each reporting date, the Bank determines whether there
is objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Bank
calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and
its carrying value, then recognises the loss as ‘Share of profit of an associate and a joint venture’ in the
statement of profit or loss. Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Bank measures and
recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the
associate upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from
disposal is recognised in statement of profit or loss.
The financial statements of the Bank are not anticipated to be materially affected by the modified standard
to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 on sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture. 
An associate is an entity over which the Bank has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to
participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control
over those policies. The Bank’s investments in its associates are accounted for using the equity method. Under
the equity method, the investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the
investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Bank’s share of net assets of the associate since the
acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is
neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment.
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction – Amendments to IAS 12 
(Continued)
The amendment should be applied to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest
comparative period presented. In addition, entities should recognise deferred tax assets (to the extent that it
is probable that they can be utilised) and deferred tax liabilities at the beginning of the earliest comparative
period for all deductible and taxable temporary differences associated with:
• right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, and
• decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities, and the corresponding amounts recognised as part of
the cost of the related assets.
The cumulative effect of recognising these adjustments is recognised in retained earnings, or another
component of equity, as appropriate.
IAS 12 did not previously address how to account for the tax effects of on-balance sheet leases and similar
transactions and various approaches were considered acceptable. Some entities may have already accounted
for such transactions consistent with the new requirements. These entities will not be affected by the
amendments. The standard effective on or after 1 January 2023.

2.4 Foreign currency translation
a) Functional and presentation currency
b) Transactions and balances
2.5 Recognition of income and expenses
Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the Bank operates ('the functional currency'). The functional currency and presentation
currency of the Bank is the Ethiopian Birr (ETB). 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign
currency transactions and from the translation at exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in currencies other than the Bank's functional currency are recognised in profit or loss within
other (loss)/income. Monetary items denominated in foreign currency are translated using the closing rate as
at the reporting date.
Changes in the fair value of monetary securities denominated in foreign currency classified as available for
sale are analysed between translation differences resulting from changes in the amortised cost of the security
and other changes in the carrying amount of the security. Translation differences related to changes in
amortised cost are recognised in profit or loss, and other changes in carrying amount are recognised in other
comprehensive income.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value
through profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation
differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at fair value, such as equities classified as FVOCI, are
included in other comprehensive income.
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Bank and
the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at
the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of
payment and excluding taxes or duty.
The Bank earns income from interest on
loans and advances given to customers, service charges and
commissions from customers, interest income from Deposits with local and correspondent banks, investment
in NBE (National Bank of Ethiopia) bills. Other income includes incomes like foreign currency transactions,
dividend, rental, and other miscellaneous incomes.

— the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; 
— the amortised cost of the financial liability. 
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest
income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the
asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.
For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying
the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the asset. The calculation of interest
income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves. 
Interest income and expense are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The
‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through
the expected life of the financial instrument to:
In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount
of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments other than credit-impaired assets, the
Bank estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not
expected credit losses. For credit-impaired financial assets, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate is
calculated using estimated future cash flows including expected credit losses.
The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees and points paid or received
that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, if the amount is material. Transaction costs include
incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial
liability.
The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or
financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the
cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount
and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance (or
impairment allowance before 1 July 2018). 
The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for
any expected credit loss allowance.

Interest income and expense on all trading assets and liabilities are considered to be incidental to the Bank’s
trading operations and are presented together with all other changes in the fair value of trading assets and
liabilities in net trading income. 
This is recognised when the Bank’s right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when the
shareholders approve and declare the dividend.
These are gains and losses arising on settlement and translation of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the functional currency’s mid rate of exchange at the reporting date.
This amount is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and it is further broken down into realised and
unrealised portion.  
The monetary assets and liabilities include financial assets within the foreign currencies deposits received and
held on behalf of third parties etc.   
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
— interest on financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost calculated on an effective
interest basis;
— interest on debt instruments measured at FVOCI calculated on an effective interest basis;
— the effective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivatives designated in cash flow hedges
of variability in interest cash flows, in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect interest
income/expense; and
— the effective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivatives designated in fair value hedges
of interest rate risk.
When a loan commitment is not expected to result in the draw-down of a loan, loan commitment fees are
recognised on a straight-line basis over the commitment period.
Other fees and commission expenses relate mainly to transaction and service fees and are expensed as the
services are received.
Interest income and expense on other financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL are presented in net
income from other financial instruments at FVTPL.
Fees and commission income and expenses that are integral to the effective interest rate on a financial asset
or liability are included in the measurement of the effective interest rate. Other fees and commission income
such as rental income, telephone and SWIFT are recognised as the related services are performed.

and 
— the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely
payments of principal and interest (SPPI). `
A debt instrument shall be measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not
designated at FVTPL: 
— the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash
flows and selling financial assets; and 
— the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI. 
The Bank shall initially recognise loans and advances, deposits, debt securities issued and subordinated
liabilities on the date on which they are originated. All other financial instruments (including regular-way
purchases and sales of financial assets) shall be recognised on the trade date, which is the date on which the
Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A financial asset or financial liability shall be measured initially at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value
through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. 
On initial recognition, a financial asset shall be classified either as measured at either amortised cost, fair
value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
The Bank shall measure a financial asset at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is
not designated at FVTPL:
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
On initial recognition, an equity investment that is held for trading shall be classified at FVTPL. However, for
equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes
in fair value in other comprehensive income (OCI). This election is made on an investment-by-investment
basis.
All other financial assets that do not meet the classification criteria at amortised cost or FVOCI, above, shall
be classified as measured at FVTPL.
In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets
the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI or at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or
significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise .

— the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In
particular, whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest revenue, maintaining a
particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities
that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets; 
— how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Bank’s management; 
— the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that
business model) and its strategy for how those risks are managed; 
— how managers of the business are compensated (e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of
the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected); and 
— the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations
about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as
part of an overall assessment of how the Bank’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved
and how cash flows are realised. 
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis
shall be measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to
collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. 
Financial assets shall not be reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the
Bank changes its business model for managing financial assets. 
The Bank shall make an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a
portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to
management. The information considered includes: 
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Bank considers the contractual terms of the
instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change
the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the
assessment, the Bank considers: 
For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ shall be defined as the fair value of the financial asset on
initial recognition. ‘Interest’ shall be defined as the consideration for the time value of money and for the
credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other
basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as profit margin.

Financial assets and financial liabilities (continued)
ii)         Financial liabilities
c. Impairment 
The Bank shall classify its financial liabilities, other than financial guarantees and loan commitments, as
measured at amortised cost or FVTPL.
A financial guarantee is an undertaking/commitment that requires the issuer to make specified payments to
reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified party fails to meet its obligation when due in
accordance with the contractual terms.
The Bank shall recognise loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECL) on the following financial
instruments that are not measured at FVTPL: 
— debt investment securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and 
— other financial instruments (other than lease receivables) on which credit risk has not increased
significantly since their initial recognition. 
— financial assets that are debt instruments; 
— lease receivables; 
— financial guarantee contracts issued; and 
— loan commitments issued. 
No impairment loss shall be recognised on equity investments. 
Financial guarantees issued by the Bank are initially measured at their fair values and, if not designated as at
FVTPL, are subsequently measured at the higher of: the amount of the obligation under the guarantee, as
determined in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets; and the amount 
initially recognised less, where appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with the
revenue recognition policies.
The Bank shall measure loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except for the following, which
are measured as 12-month ECL: 
— contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows; 
— leverage features; 
— prepayment and extension terms; 
— terms that limit the Bank’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse loans); and 
— features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates). 
At each reporting date, the Bank shall assess whether there is objective evidence that financial assets (except
equity investments), other than those carried at FVTPL, are impaired.

i)        Measurement of ECL 
ii)        Restructured financial assets 
Loss allowances for lease receivables shall always be measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.
12-month ECL is the portion of ECL that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible
within the 12 months after the reporting date. Financial instruments for which a 12-month ECL is recognised
are referred to as ‘Stage 1 financial instruments’.
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Life-time ECL is the ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial
instrument. Financial instruments for which a lifetime ECL is recognised but which are not credit-impaired are
referred to as ‘Stage 2 financial instruments’. Other wise, the financial instruments classified as ‘Stage 3
financial instruments’.
— for financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date (stage 1 and 2): as the present value
of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the Bank in accordance with the
contract and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive); 
— for financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date (stage 3): as the difference between the
gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows; 
— for undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows
that are due to the Bank if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Bank expects to
receive; and 
— for financial guarantee contracts: as the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that
the Bank expects to recover. 
Where the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced
with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then the Bank shall assess whether the financial
asset should be derecognised and ECL are measured as follows:
— If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash
flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing
asset.
— If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value
of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its
derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that
are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective
interest rate of the existing financial asset.
ECL is a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. It shall be measured as follows:

iii)        Credit-impaired financial assets 
iv)        Presentation of allowance for ECL in the statement of financial position 
At each reporting date, the Bank shall assess whether financial assets carried at amortised cost, debt financial
assets carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial
assets’).
A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition shall be considered to be
credit-impair unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced
significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90
days or more shall be considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different.
A financial asset shall be considered ‘credit impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental
impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. 
Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:
— significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer; 
— a breach of contract such as a default or past due event; 
— the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Bank on terms that the Bank would not consider otherwise; 
— it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or 
— the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties. 
— for financial assets measured at amortised cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the
assets; 
— for loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts: generally, as a provision; 
— where a financial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Bank cannot
identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from those on the drawn component: the
Bank presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The combined amount is presented as a
deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over the
gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision; and 
— for debt instruments measured at FVOCI: no loss allowance is recognised in the statement of financial
position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance shall be
disclosed and is recognised in the fair value reserve. 
Loss allowances for ECL shall be presented in the statement of financial position as follows:

Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with
the Bank’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.
Where the Bank determines that the guarantee is an integral element of the financial asset, then any premium
payable in connection with the initial recognition of the financial asset shall be treated as a transaction cost
of acquiring it. The Bank shall consider the effect of the protection when measuring the fair value of the debt
instrument and when measuring ECL. 
Recoveries of amounts previously written off shall be included in ‘impairment losses on financial instruments’
in the statement of profit or loss and OCI. 
The Bank shall derecognise a financial asset when:
Where the Bank determines that the guarantee is not an integral element of the debt instrument, then it shall
recognise an asset representing any prepayment of guarantee premium and a right to compensation for credit
losses. 
— The contractual right to the cash flows from the financial asset expires (see also (1.4)), or 
— It transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the
risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred; or
— Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not
retain control of the financial asset.
The Bank shall assess whether a financial guarantee contract held is an integral element of a financial asset
that is accounted for as a component of that instrument or is a contract that is accounted for separately. 
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Loans and debt securities shall be written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable
expectation of recovering the amount in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the
Bank determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient
cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment shall be carried out at the
individual asset level.

i)        Financial assets 
If the terms of a financial asset are modified, then the Bank shall evaluate whether the cash flows of the
modified asset are substantially different. 
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the
carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of (i) the consideration
received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss
that had been recognised in OCI shall be recognised in profit or loss.
Where the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in
derecognition of the financial asset, then the Bank shall first recalculate the gross carrying amount of the
financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognises the resulting adjustment as
a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. Any costs or fees incurred and fees received as part of the
modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and shall be amortised over the
remaining term of the modified financial asset. 
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI
shall not be recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities.
The Bank shall derecognise a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or
expire. 
If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original
financial asset shall be deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset shall be derecognised
(see (1.3)) and a new financial asset shall be recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any
fees received as part of the modification shall be accounted for as follows:
Any interest in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the
Bank shall be recognised as a separate asset or liability.
— fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent
reimbursement of eligible transaction costs shall be included in the initial measurement of the asset; and 
— other fees are included in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.
If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification
is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with
substantially different terms.
If the Bank plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it
shall first consider whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place.

i)        Financial assets

Where such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower, then the gain or loss
shall be presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it shall be presented as interest income
calculated using the effective interest rate method. 
The Bank shall derecognise a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified
liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms shall be
recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised
and consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. Consideration paid shall include non-financial assets
transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability. 
Financial assets and financial liabilities shall be offset and the net amount presented in the statement of
financial position when, and only when, the Bank currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the
amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.
— the liabilities are managed, evaluated and reported internally on a fair value basis; or 
— the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. 
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Where the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost
of the liability shall be recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest
rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any costs and fees incurred are recognised as
an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modified
financial liability by re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument. 
At initial recognition, the Bank may designate certain financial assets as at FVTPL because this designation
eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch, which would otherwise arise.
The Bank shall designate certain financial liabilities as at FVTPL in either of the following circumstances: 
Income and expenses shall be presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS, or for gains and losses
arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Bank’s trading activity.

The profit is quantifiable and contractually determined at the commencement of the contract. Murabaha
Income (profit) is recognised as it accrues over the life of the contract using the effective profit method
(EPRM) on the principal balance outstanding.
These products are carried at amortised cost less impairment.

It is treated as financing receivables. Financing receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Interest Free export financing facility is a short term financing given to the borrower for three months free of
any charge or profit and not subject to discounting being a short term facility. Interest free export facility
financing is stated in the statement of financial position of the bank at fair value of the consideration given
(amount of disbursement) and subsequently, they shall be stated at disbursement amount less loss allowances
(if any).
Cash comprises cash on hand, deposits held on call with other banks, and other short term highly liquid
investments. Cash equivalents are deemed of immediate realization since they are easily convertible into cash
within three months following the date of the financial statements.
Murabaha is an interest free financing transaction which represents an agreement whereby the Bank buys a
commodity/good and sells it to a counterparty (customer) based on a promise received from that counterparty 
to buy the commodity according to specific terms and conditions. The selling price comprises of the cost of
the commodity/goods and a pre-agreed profit margin.

Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment if the
recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be
replaced at intervals, the Bank recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and
depreciates them accordingly. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in statement of profit or
loss as incurred.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying value or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the bank and the
cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising on
derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying
value of the asset) is included in statement of profit or loss.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed
at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Capital work-in-progress is not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use. They are disclosed
when reclassified during the year.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over
their estimated useful lives, as follows:
The Bank construct buildings in different cities mainly for image building, branches office and issue accounts
use. The remaining is rented out. If the building is rented up to 80% of the floor of the building, the building
shall be treated as PPE. If the building is rented out for more than 80% of the floor of the building, we ought
to transfer it to Investment property (IP).

Intangible assets
2.11
  
Impairment of non-financial assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition,
intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if
any. Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the
related expenditure is reflected in statement of profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is
incurred .
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite
lives are amortised over the useful economic life. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an
intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Changes in the
expected useful life, or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the
asset, are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or methodology, as appropriate, which are then
treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expenses on intangible assets with finite lives
are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss, if significant.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight–line method to write down the cost of intangible assets to their
residual values over the lower of their estimated useful lives of six years or by the license duration for
purchased computer software.
The Bank assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If
any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Bank estimates the
asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating
unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from
other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no
such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are
corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair
value indicators.
The Bank bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared
separately for each of the Bank’s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and
forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is
calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.

Fair value measurement
Prepayments are payments made in advance for services to be enjoyed in future. The amount is initially
capitalized in the reporting period in which the payment is made and subsequently amortised over the period
in which the service is to be enjoyed.
Other receivables are recognised upon the occurrence of an event or transaction as they arise and are
cancelled when payment is received.
The Bank measures financial instruments classified as available-for-sale at fair value at each statement of
financial position date. Fair value related disclosures for financial instruments and non-financial assets that
are measured at fair value or where fair values are disclosed are, summarised in the following notes:
•   Disclosures for valuation methods, significant estimates and assumptions Notes 3 and Note 4.7.1
•   Quantitative disclosures of fair value measurement hierarchy Note 4.7.2
•   Financial instruments (including those carried at amortised cost) Note 4.7.2
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on
the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
•   In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
•   In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an
indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication
exists, the Bank estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss
is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable
amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of
the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such
reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
Other assets are generally defined as claims held against other entities for the future receipt of money. The
other assets in the Bank's financial statements include the following:

Employee benefits
(a) Wages, salaries  and annual leave
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
The Bank uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data
are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use
of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
   Level 1 —  Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Bank
determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of
each reporting period.
The Bank’s management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement,
such as available-for-sale financial assets.
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
The Bank provides post-employment schemes, including both defined benefit and defined contribution pension
plans and post employment benefits.
Wages, salaries, other allowances, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the period in which the
associated services are rendered by employees of the Bank. The Bank operates an accumulating leave policy;
this can be encashed when the employee is leaving employment or paid in cash if the bank rarely decides to
pay in cash. The Bank measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional
amount that the entity expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end
of each reporting period.

2.14 Employee benefits (continued)
(b) Defined contribution plan
(c) Defined benefit plan
(d ) Termination benefits
(e )
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan
assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit
credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated
future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency
in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related
pension obligation.
The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognised in the statement of profit or loss in employee
benefit expense, except where included in the cost of an asset, reflects the increase in the defined benefit
obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes curtailments and settlements.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are
charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The Bank recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing based on a formula that takes
into consideration the profit attributable to the company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Bank
recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a
constructive obligation.
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present
value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. 
The Bank operates a defined contribution plans of pension scheme in line with the provisions of Ethiopian
Pension of Private Organisation Employees Proclamation No. 715/2011. Funding under the scheme is 7% and
11% by employees and the Bank respectively; 2% provident fund contribution is made by the bank for
employees covered under pension scheme.
Termination benefits are payable to executive directors when employment is terminated by the Bank before
the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these
benefits. The Bank recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either: terminating
the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal;
or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.

(i) Bank as a lessee
The Bank presents basic earnings per share for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share are calculated by
dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Bank by the weighted average number
of shares outstanding during the period.
At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Bank allocates
consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone price. However,
for leases of branches and office premises the Bank has elected not to separate non-lease components and
accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
A provision is recognised when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past
event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle
the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Bank expects
some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is
recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to
a provision is presented in statement of profit or loss net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate
that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in
the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as other operating expenses.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
The legal reserve which is a statutory reserve to which no less than 25% of the net profits after taxation shall
be transferred each year until such fund is equal to the capital. When the legal reserve equals the capital of
the Bank, the amount to be transferred to the legal reserve account shall be 10% of the annual net profit.

2.19 Leases (continued)
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:
When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount
of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has
been reduced to zero.
The Bank presents right-of-use assets in ‘property and equipment’ and lease liabilities in ‘other liabilities’ in
the statement of financial position.
The Bank determines its incremental borrowing rate by analysing its borrowings from various external sources
and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of asset leased.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily
determined, the Bank’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Bank uses its incremental borrowing rate
as the discount rate.
—fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;
—variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially
—measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;
—amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and
—the exercise price under a purchase option that the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments
in an optional renewal period if the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties
for early termination of a lease unless the Bank is reasonably certain not to terminate early.
The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when
there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the 
Bank’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Bank changes
its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised
in-substance fixed lease payment.
The Bank recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-
use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for
any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an
estimate of costs to dismantle and remove any improvements made to branches or office premises.
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement
date to the end of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment
losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

(ii) Bank as a lessor
2.20
Income tax
(a) Current income tax
(b) Deferred tax
When the Bank acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether the lease is a finance lease or an
operating lease.
To classify each lease, the Bank makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all
of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a
finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Bank considers certain
indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.
The income tax expense or credit for the year is the tax payable on the current year’s taxable income based
on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and
liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at
the end of the reporting period in Ethiopia. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns
with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes
provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is recognised as temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they
arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred
tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax
assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes
levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where
there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
At inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Bank allocates the
consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone selling prices.
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
The Bank applies the derecognition and impairment requirements in IFRS 16 to the net investment in the
lease. The Bank further regularly reviews estimated unguaranteed residual values used in calculating the gross
investment in the lease.

    3.2 Estimates and assumptions
The Bank’s management has made an assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern and is satisfied
that it has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, management is not
aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Bank’s ability to continue as a
going concern, except that it has to make significant effort to reach the minimum capital requirement.
However, the financial statements continue to be prepared on going concern basis.
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The Bank has entered into commercial property leases. The Bank has determined, based on an evaluation of
the terms and conditions of the arrangements, such as the lease term not constituting a substantial portion of
the economic life of the commercial property, that it does not retain all the significant risks and rewards of
ownership of these properties and accounts for the contracts as leases.
The preparation of the Bank’s financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the
accompanying disclosures, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these
assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying value
of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.
Other disclosures relating to the Bank’s exposure to risks and uncertainties include:
• Capital management Note 4.6
• Financial risk management and policies Note 4
Judgments
In the process of applying the Bank’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgments,
which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
Lease commitments - Bank as lessee
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation at the reporting date, that
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying values of assets and liabilities within
the next financial year, are described below. The Bank based its assumptions and estimates on parameters
available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future
developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances beyond the control of the Bank.
Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

Impairment losses on loans and receivables
The Bank reviews its loan portfolios for impairment on an on-going basis. The Bank first assesses whether
objective evidence of impairment exists individually for loans and receivables that are individually significant,
and individually or collectively for loans and receivables that are not individually significant. Impairment
provisions are also recognised for losses not specifically identified but which, experience and observable data
indicate are present in the portfolio at the date of assessment. For individually significant loans and
receivables that have been deemed to be impaired, management deems that the cash flow from collateral
would arise within one year where the loans and receivables is back by collateral.
Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and
objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the portfolio when scheduling its future cash flows. The
methodology and assumptions used for estimating both the amount and timing of future cash flows are
reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.
The use of historical loss experience is supplemented with significant management judgment to assess
whether current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual level of inherent losses is likely to
differ from that suggested by historical experience. In normal circumstances, historical experience provides
objective and relevant information from which to assess inherent loss within each portfolio. In other
circumstances, historical loss experience provides less relevant information about the inherent loss in a given
portfolio at the balance sheet date, for example, where there have been changes in economic conditions such
that the most recent trends in risk factors are not fully reflected in the historical information. In these
circumstances, such risk factors are taken into account when calculating the appropriate levels of impairment
allowances, by adjusting the impairment loss derived solely from historical loss experience.
The detailed methodologies, areas of estimation and judgment applied in the calculation of the Bank's
impairment charge on financial assets are set out in the financial risk management section.
The estimation of impairment losses is subject to uncertainty, which has increased in the current economic
environment and is highly sensitive to factors such as the level of economic activity, unemployment rates,
property price trends and interest rates. The assumptions underlying this judgement are highly subjective. The
methodology and the assumptions used in calculating impairment losses are reviewed regularly in the light of
differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience. 
Fair value  measurement of financial instruments
When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the statement of financial position
cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation
techniques including the discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The inputs to these models are taken from
observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required in
establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and
volatility. As at year end, no financial instrument was measured at fair value. See Note 4.7.1 for further
disclosures.

(f) Income Taxes
Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount,
which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The fair value less costs of
disposal calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions, conducted at arm’s length, for
similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use
calculation is based on a DCF model. The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years and
do not include restructuring activities that the Bank is not yet committed to or significant future investments
that will enhance the asset’s performance of the CGU being tested. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the
discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the
growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. 
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the
amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and
the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the
actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future
adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. The amount of such provisions is based on various
factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the
taxable entity and the responsible tax authority.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit
will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to
determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the
level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.
Defined benefit plans
The cost of the defined benefit pension plan, long service awards and gratuity scheme and the present value
of these defined benefit obligations are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves
making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the
determination of the discount rate, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due
to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly
sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
Depreciation and carrying value of property, plant and equipment
The estimation of the useful lives and residual values of assets is based on management’s judgement. Any
material adjustment to the estimated useful lives of items of property and equipment will have an impact on
the carrying value of these items.

Financial risk management
4.1
Introduction
4.1.1 Risk management structure
Risk is inherent in the Bank’s activities, but is managed through a process of ongoing identification, measurement
and monitoring, subject to risk limits and other controls. This process of risk management is critical to the Bank’s
continuing profitability and each individual within the Bank is accountable for the risk exposures relating to his or
her responsibilities. The Bank is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and different operational risks. It is
also subject to various risks that affect the financial sector of the country.
The independent risk control process does not include business risks such as changes in the environment, technology
and industry. The Bank's policy is to monitor those business risks through the Bank’s strategic planning process.
The Board Risk Sub-Committee, a subset of the Board of Directors is responsible for the overall risk management
approach and for approving the risk management strategies and principles. It also has the responsibility to monitor
the overall risk process within the Bank.
The Senior Management chaired by the chief Executive Officer (CEO) has the overall responsibility for the
development of the risk strategy and implementing principles, frameworks, policies and limits. It is also responsible
for managing risk decisions and monitoring risk levels and reports on a monthly basis to the Board Risk Sub-
Committee.
The Risk Management Unit is responsible for implementing and maintaining risk related procedures to ensure an
independent control process is maintained. The unit works closely with the Senior Management to ensure that
procedures are compliant with the overall framework.
The Risk Management Unit is responsible for monitoring compliance with risk principles, policies and limits across the
Bank. It carries out an assessment of risk on an ad hoc basis to monitor the Bank's independent control of risks,
including monitoring the risk of exposures against limits and the assessment of risks of new products and structured
transactions. This unit also ensures the complete capture of the risks in risk measurement and reporting systems.
Exceptions are reported, where necessary, to the Senior Management, and further to the Board Risk Sub-Committee
and the relevant actions are taken to address exceptions and any areas of weakness.
The Bank Finance and Treasury function is responsible for managing the Bank’s financial assets, financial liabilities
and the overall financial structure. It is also primarily responsible for the funding and liquidity risks of the Bank.
The Bank’s policy is that risk management processes throughout the Bank are audited annually by the Internal Audit
Function, which examines both the adequacy of the procedures and the Bank’s compliance with the procedures. The
Internal Audit Function discusses the results of all assessments with management, and reports its findings and
recommendations to the Board Audit Sub-Committee.

The Bank’s risks are measured using a method that reflects both the expected loss likely to arise in normal
circumstances and unexpected losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss based on statistical models.
The models make use of probabilities derived from historical experience, adjusted to reflect the economic
environment. The Bank also runs worst-case scenarios that would arise in the event that extreme events, which are
unlikely to occur, do in fact, occur.
Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily performed based on limits established by the Bank. These limits reflect
the business strategy and market environment of the Bank as well as the level of risk that the Bank is willing to
accept, with additional emphasis on selected regions. In addition, the Bank’s policy is to measure and monitor the
overall risk bearing capacity in relation to the aggregate risk exposure across all risk types and activities.
Risk controls and mitigates, identified and approved for the Bank, are documented for existing and new processes
and systems.
The adequacy of these mitigates is tested on a periodic basis through administration of control self-assessment
questionnaires, using an operational risk management tool which requires risk owners to confirm the effectiveness of
established controls. These are subsequently audited as part of the review process.
The Bank's financial assets are classified into the following measurement categories: Financial assets at fair value
through OCI and Financial assets at amortized cost and the financial liabilities are classified into other liabilities at
amortised cost.
Financial instruments are classified in the statement of financial position in accordance with their legal form and
substance.

Credit risk
In measuring credit risk of Financial assets at amortized cost to various counterparties, the Bank considers the
character and capacity of the obligor to pay or meet contractual obligations, current exposures to the
counterparty/obligor and its likely future developments, credit history of the counterparty/obligor; and the likely
recovery ratio in case of default obligations-value of collateral and other solutions. Our credit exposure comprises
wholesale and retail Financial assets at amortized cost which are developed to reflect the needs of our customers.
The Bank’s policy is to lend principally on the basis of our customer’s repayment capacity through quantitative and
qualitative evaluation. However we ensure that our loans are backed by collateral to reflect the risk of the obligors
and the nature of the facility.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Bank if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to
meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Bank’s loans and advances to customers and other
banks and other financial assets.
Exposure to credit risk is managed through periodic analysis of the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to
determine their capacity to meet principal and interest thereon, and restructuring such limits as appropriate.
Exposure to credit risk is also mitigated, in part, by obtaining collateral, commercial and personal guarantees .
The Bank structures the levels of credit risk it undertakes by placing limits on the amount of risk accepted in relation
to one borrower, or groups of borrowers, and to term of the financial instrument and economic sectors.
The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) sets credit risk limit for a single borrower, one related party and all related
parties to not exceed 25%, 5% and 35%  of Bank’s total capital amount as of the reporting quarterly period
respectively. 
Credit management is conducted as per the risk management policy and guideline approved by the board of directors
and the Risk Management Committees. Such policies are reviewed and modified periodically based on changes and
expectations of the markets where the Bank operates, regulations, and other factors.

The credit quality of Cash and bank balances and short-term investments that were neither past due nor impaired at
as 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2022 and are held in Ethiopian banks have been classified as non-rated as there are no
credit rating agencies in Ethiopia. However, Cash and bank balances that is held in foreign banks can be assessed by
reference to credit rating agency designation as shown in the table below;
This denotes expectations of a very low default risk. It indicates a very strong capacity for
payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable
events.
This
denotes
expectations
of
low
default
risk.
The
capacity
for
payment
of
financial
commitments is considered strong. This capacity may, nevertheless, be more vulnerable to
adverse business or economic conditions than is the case for higher ratings.
This indicates that expectations of default risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of
financial commitments is considered adequate, but adverse business or economic conditions are
more likely to impair this capacity.
This indicates financial institutions or other counterparties with no available ratings and cash in
hand.
A "+ "(plus) or "-" (minus) may be appended to a rating to indicate the relative position of a credit within the rating 
category. This is based on Fitch national long-term issuer default ratings.

The bank holds collateral or other credit enhancements to mitigate credit risk associated with financial assets. The
main types of collateral and the types of assets these are associated with are listed below. The Bank does not sell or
repledge the collateral in the absence of default by the borrower. In addition to the Bank's focus on
creditworthiness, the Bank aligns with its credit policy guide to periodically update the validation of collaterals held
against all loans to customers. 
The estimated value real estate collaterals are based on the last revaluations carried out by the Bank's in-house
engineers. The valuation technique adopted for properties is in line with the Bank's valuation manual.

ii)      Significant increase in credit risk
When determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial
recognition, the Bank considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue
cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Bank’s
historical experience and expert credit assessment and including forward-looking information.
The objective of the assessment is to identify whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred for an
exposure by comparing:
—   the remaining lifetime probability of default (PD) as at the reporting date; with
—   the remaining lifetime PD for this point in time that was estimated at the time of initial recognition of the
exposure (adjusted where relevant for changes in prepayment expectations).
—   the Bank uses three criteria for determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk:
—   quantitative test based on movement in PD;
—   qualitative indicators; and
—   a backstop of 30 days past due,
i)        Inputs, assumptions and techniques used for estimating impairment
ii)      Investment securities designated as at FVTPL
See accounting policy in Note 2.6
i)        Loans and advances to customers
The general creditworthiness of a customer tends to be the most relevant indicator of credit quality of a loan
extended to it. However, collateral provides additional security and the Bank generally requests that corporate
borrowers provide it. The Bank may take collateral in the form of a first charge over real estate, floating charges
over all corporate assets and other liens and guarantees.
Because of the Bank’s focus on customers’ creditworthiness, the Bank does not routinely update the valuation of
collateral held against all loans to customers. Valuation of collateral of real estates (buildings) is updated and
reviewed every three year and at the same time whenever the loan foreclosure measure is opted. For credit-
impaired loans, the Bank obtains appraisals of collateral because it provides input into determining the management
credit risk actions.
As at 30 June 2023, the net carrying amount of credit impaired loans and advances to customers amounted to ETB
1.807 billion (2022: ETB 2.440 billion) and the value of identifiable collateral held against those loans and advances
amounted to ETB 1.903 billion (2022: ETB 4.779 billion). For each loan, the value of disclosed collateral is capped at
the nominal amount of the loan that it is held against.
As at 30 June 2023, the Bank had no exposure to credit risk of the investment securities designated as at FVTPL.

4.3.6
Credit risk grades are a primary input into the determination of the term structure of PD for exposures. The Bank
collects performance and default information about its credit risk exposures analysed by type of product and
borrower as well as by credit risk grading. The Bank employs statistical models to analyse the data collected and
generate estimates of the remaining lifetime PD of exposures and how these are expected to change as a result of
the passage of time.
a.         Term loan exposures
—   Information obtained during periodic review of customer files – e.g. audited financial statements, management
accounts, budgets and projections. Examples of areas of particular focus are: gross profit margins, financial leverage
ratios, debt service coverage, compliance
—   Data from credit reference agencies, press articles, changes in external credit ratings
—   Actual and expected significant changes in the political, regulatory and technological environment of the
borrower or in its business activities
—   Internally collected data on customer behaviour – e.g. utilisation of credit card facilities
—   Affordability metrics
b.        Overdraft exposures
iv)    Generating the term structure of PD
—   Payment record – this includes overdue status as well as a range of variables about payment ratios
—   Utilisation of the granted limit
—   Requests for and granting of forbearance
—   Existing and forecast changes in business, financial and economic conditions

iii)    Credit risk grades
The Bank allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on a variety of data that is determined to be
predictive of the risk of default and applying experienced credit judgement. Credit risk grades are defined using
qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of risk of default. These factors vary depending on the nature
of the exposure and the type of borrower.
Credit risk grades are defined and calibrated such that the risk of default occurring increases exponentially as the
credit risk deteriorates so, for example, the difference in risk of default between credit risk grades 1 and 2 is smaller
than the difference between credit risk grades 2 and 3. Each exposure is allocated to a credit risk grade on initial
recognition based on available information about the borrower. Exposures are subject to ongoing monitoring, which
may result in an exposure being moved to a different credit risk grade. The monitoring typically involves use of the
following data;

If there is evidence that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk relative to initial recognition, then the
loss allowance on an instrument returns to being measured as 12-month ECL. Some qualitative indicators of an
increase in credit risk, such as delinquency or forbearance, may be indicative of an increased risk of default that
persists after the indicator itself has ceased to exist. In these cases, the Bank determines a probation period during
which the financial asset is required to demonstrate good behaviour to provide evidence that its credit risk has
declined sufficiently. When contractual terms of a loan have been modified, evidence that the criteria for
recognising lifetime ECL are no longer met includes a history of up-to-date payment performance against the
modified contractual terms. 
The Bank monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify significant increases in credit risk by regular
reviews to confirm that:
there is no unwarranted volatility in loss allowance from transfers between 12-month PD (Stage 1) and lifetime PD
(Stage 2).
vi)    Definition of default
The Bank assesses whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition at each reporting date.
Determining whether an increase in credit risk is significant depends on the characteristics of the financial
instrument and the borrower. 
The credit risk may also be deemed to have increased significantly since initial recognition based on qualitative
factors linked to the Bank’s credit risk management processes that may not otherwise be fully reflected in its
quantitative analysis on a timely basis. This will be the case for exposures that meet certain heightened risk criteria,
such as placement on a watch list. Such qualitative factors are based on its expert judgment and relevant historical
experiences.
v)      Determining whether credit risk has increased 
significantly
Amounts arising from ECL (Continued)
the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank in full, without recourse by the Bank to actions
such as realising security (if any is held);
Overdrafts are considered as being past due once the customer has breached an advised limit or been advised of a
limit smaller than the current amount outstanding; or
it is becoming probable that the borrower will restructure the asset as a result of bankruptcy due to the borrower’s
inability to pay its credit obligations.
The Bank considers a financial asset to be in default when:
As a backstop, the Bank considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when an asset is more
than 30 days past due. Days past due are determined by counting the number of days since the earliest elapsed due
date in respect of which full payment has not been received. Due dates are determined without considering any
grace period that might be available to the borrower.

vii)  Incorporation of forward-looking information (Continued)
The Bank incorporates forward-looking information into both the assessment of whether the credit risk of an 
instrument has increased significantly since its initial recognition and the measurement of ECL.
For each segment, the Bank formulates three economic scenarios: a base case, which is the median scenario, and
two less likely scenarios, one upside and one downside. For each sector, the base case is aligned with the
macroeconomic model’s information value output, a measure of the predictive power of the model, as well as base
macroeconomic projections for identified macroeconomic variables for each sector. The upside and downside
scenarios are based on a combination of a percentage error factor of each sector model as well as simulated
optimistic and pessimistic macroeconomic projections based on a measure of historical macroeconomic volatilities.
The Bank has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for each portfolio of financial
instruments and, using an analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between macro-economic variables
and credit risk and credit losses.
External information considered includes economic data and forecasts published by Business Monitor International,
an external and independent macroeconomic data body. This is in addition to industry – level, semi – annual NPL
trends across statistically comparable sectors.
Amounts arising from ECL (Continued)
Periodically, the Bank carries out stress testing of more extreme shocks to calibrate its determination of the upside
and downside representative scenarios. A comprehensive review is performed at least annually on the design of the
scenarios by a panel of experts that advises the Bank’s senior management.
In assessing whether a borrower is in default, the Bank considers indicators that are:
Inputs into the assessment of whether a financial instrument is in default and their significance may vary over time
to reflect changes in circumstances.
The definition of default largely aligns with that applied by the Bank for regulatory capital purposes .

When modification results in derecognition, a new loan is recognised and allocated to Stage 1 (assuming it is not
credit-impaired at that time).
Scenario probability weightings
As at June 2023
As at June 2022
The contractual terms of a loan may be modified for a number of reasons, including changing market conditions,
customer retention and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of the customer. An
existing loan whose terms have been modified may be derecognised and the renegotiated loan recognised as a new
loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy set out.
The Bank renegotiates loans to customers in financial difficulties (referred to as ‘forbearance activities’) to
maximise collection opportunities and minimise the risk of default. Under the Bank’s forbearance policy, loan
forbearance is granted on a selective basis if the debtor is currently in default on its debt or if there is a high risk of
default, there is evidence that the debtor made all reasonable efforts to pay under the original contractual terms
and the debtor is expected to be able to meet the revised terms.
The revised terms usually include extending the maturity, changing the timing of interest payments and amending
the terms of loan covenants. Both retail and corporate loans are subject to the forbearance policy. The Bank Credit
Committee regularly reviews reports on forbearance activities.
For financial assets modified as part of the Bank’s forbearance policy, the estimate of PD reflects whether the
modification has improved or restored the Bank’s ability to collect interest and principal and the Bank’s previous
experience of similar forbearance action. As part of this process, the Bank evaluates the borrower’s payment
performance against the modified contractual terms and considers various behavioural indicators.
viii)  Modified financial assets
When the terms of a financial asset are modified and the modification does not result in derecognition, the
determination of whether the asset’s credit risk has increased significantly reflects comparison of: its remaining
lifetime PD at the reporting date based on the modified terms; with the remaining lifetime PD estimated based on
data on initial recognition and the original contractual terms.
Generally, forbearance is a qualitative indicator of a significant increase in credit risk and an expectation of
forbearance may constitute evidence that an exposure is credit-impaired. A customer needs to demonstrate
consistently good payment behaviour over a period of time before the exposure is no longer considered to be credit-
impaired/in default or the PD is considered to have decreased such that the loss allowance reverts to being
measured at an amount equal to Stage 1.

ECL for exposures in Stage 1 is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD by LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated
by multiplying the lifetime PD by LGD and EAD.
The methodology of estimating PDs is discussed above under the heading ‘Generating the term structure of PD’.
EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Bank derives the EAD from the current exposure
to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract and arising from
amortisation. The EAD of a financial asset is its gross carrying amount at the time of default. For lending
commitments, the EADs are potential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated
based on historical observations and forward-looking forecasts. For financial guarantees, the EAD represents the
amount of the guaranteed exposure when the financial guarantee becomes payable. For some financial assets, EAD is
determined by modelling the range of possible exposure outcomes at various points in time using scenario and
statistical techniques.
LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Bank estimates LGD parameters based on the history
of recovery rates of claims against defaulted counterparties. The LGD models consider the structure, collateral,
seniority of the claim, counterparty industry and recovery costs of any collateral that is integral to the financial
asset. 
Amounts arising from ECL (Continued)
ix)    Measurement of ECL
As described above, and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for Stage 1 financial assets, the Bank
measures ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period (including any borrower’s
extension options) over which it is exposed to credit risk, even if, for credit risk management purposes, the Bank
considers a longer period. 
The maximum contractual period extends to the date at which the Bank has the right to require repayment of an
advance or terminate a loan commitment or guarantee. 
However, for overdrafts that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment component, the Bank measures ECL
over a period longer than the maximum contractual period if the Bank’s contractual ability to demand repayment
and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the Bank’s exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice
period. These facilities do not have a fixed term or repayment structure and are managed on a collective basis. The
Bank can cancel them with immediate effect but this contractual right is not enforced in the normal day-to-day
management, but only when the Bank becomes aware of an increase in credit risk at the facility level. This longer
period is estimated taking into account the credit risk management actions that the Bank expects to take, and that
serve to mitigate ECL. These include a reduction in limits, cancellation of the facility and/or turning the outstanding
balance into a loan with fixed repayment terms. 
The key inputs into the measurement of ECL are the term structure of the following variables:
—   Probability of default (PD);
—   loss given default (LGD); and
—   exposure at default (EAD)

Loans with renegotiated terms are defined as loans that have been restructured due to a deterioration in the
borrower’s financial position, for which the Bank has made concessions by agreeing to terms and conditions that are
more favourable for the borrower than the Bank had provided initially and that it would not otherwise consider. A
loan continues to be presented as part of loans with renegotiated terms until maturity, early repayment or write-off.
—   Loans that were past due but not impaired
In ETB'000
The maximum exposure to credit risk relating to a financial guarantee is the maximum amount the Bank could have
to pay if the guarantee is called upon. The maximum exposure to credit risk relating to a loan commitment is the full
amount of the commitment. The table below shows the Bank’s maximum credit risk exposure for commitments and
guarantees.
—   Loans with renegotiated terms
Loans that were ‘past due but not impaired’ are those for which contractual interest or principal payments were past
due but the Bank believed that impairment was not appropriate on the basis of the level of security or collateral
available and/or the stage of collection of amounts owed to the Bank. The amounts disclosed exclude assets
measured at FVTPL.

The table below analyses the Bank’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining
period at the statement of financial position date to the contractual maturity date. The cash flows presented are the
undiscounted amounts to be settled in future.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank cannot meet its maturing obligations when they become due, at reasonable
cost and in a timely manner. Liquidity risk arises because of the possibility that the Bank might be unable to meet its
payment obligations when they fall due as a result of mismatches in the timing of the cash flows under both normal
and stress circumstances. Such scenarios could occur when funding needed for illiquid asset positions is not available
to the Bank on acceptable terms.
Liquidity risk management in the Bank is solely determined by the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO), which bears
the overall responsibility for liquidity risk. The main objective of the Bank's liquidity risk framework is to maintain
sufficient liquidity in order to ensure that we meet our maturing obligations.
Assets held for managing liquidity 
risk 
Cash flow forecasting is performed by the Finance and Treasury function. The Finance and Treasury function
monitors rolling forecasts of liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs. 
The Bank has incurred indebtedness in the form of borrowings. The Bank evaluates its ability to meet its obligations
on an ongoing basis. Based on these evaluations, the Bank devises strategies to manage its liquidity risk.
Prudent liquidity risk management implies that sufficient cash is maintained and that sufficient funding is available
to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or
risk of damage to the Bank’s reputation.

Market risk
4.5.1 Management of market risk
(i)
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will be affected by changes in market interest
rates. Borrowings and lending obtained at variable rates give rise to interest rate risk. 
The Bank’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Bank’s obligations and
financial assets with floating interest rates. The Bank is also exposed on fixed rate financial assets and financial
liabilities. The Bank’s investment portfolio is comprised of treasury bills, Ethiopian government bonds and cash
deposits. 
Market risk is monitored by the risk and compliance
management function regularly, to identify any adverse
movement in the underlying variables.
Market risk is defined as the risk of loss that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate because of changes in market risk factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices,
credit spreads and their volatilities. Market risk can arise in conjunction with trading and non-trading activities of a
financial institutions. 
The Bank does not ordinarily engage in trading activities as there are no active markets in Ethiopia. 
The main objective of Market Risk Management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable
parameters, while optimising the return on risk.

Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due
to the changes in foreign exchange rates. 
The Bank is exposed to exchange rate risks to the extent of balances and transactions denominated in a currency
other than the Ethiopian Birr (ETB). The Bank’s foreign currency bank accounts act as a natural hedge for these
transactions. Management has set up a policy to manage the Bank's foreign exchange risk against its functional
currency.
The table below summarises the impact of increases/decreases of 10% on equity and profit or loss arising from the
Bank's foreign denominated borrowings and cash and bank balances.
The total foreign currency denominated assets exposed to risk as at year end 30 June 2023 was ETB 7.909billion (30
June 2022: ETB 8.383billion).

 Effect of a 10% Increase of the ETB against DJF 
 Effect of a 10% Decrease of the ETB against DJF 
The sensitivity analysis for currency rate risk shows how changes in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial
instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market rates at the reporting date.
The Bank’s objectives when managing capital are to comply with the capital requirements set by the National Bank
of Ethiopia, safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, and to maintain a strong capital base so as to
maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.

Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
According to the Licensing & Supervision of Banking Business Directive No SBB/50/2011 of the National Bank of
Ethiopia, the Bank has to maintain a capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 8% at all times, the risk weighted assets
being calculated as per the provisions of Directive No SBB/9/95 issued on 18 August 1995. Capital includes capital
contributions, retained earnings, legal reserve and other reserves to be approved by the National Bank of Ethiopia.
Credit equivalent for off-balance 
sheet items
Capital adequacy ratio
The capital adequacy ratio is the quotient of the capital base of the Bank and the Bank’s risk weighted asset base.
IFRS 13 requires an entity to classify measured or disclosed fair values according to a hierarchy that reflects the
significance of observable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised
within the fair value hierarchy, which comprises three levels as described below, based on the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole.

Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
IFRS 13 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are
observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources; unobservable
inputs reflect the Bank's market assumptions.
  - Financial assets at amortized cost 
Loans and advances to customers
The following table summarises the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the reporting date. The 
amounts are based on the values recognised in the statement of financial position.
● Level 1: Inputs that are quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
●Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) .This category includes instruments valued using:
quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in
markets that are considered less than active, another valuation technique in which all significant inputs are directly
or indirectly observable from market data.
In conclusion, this category is for valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
●Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). This
category includes all assets and liabilities for which the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable
data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the asset's or liability's valuation. This category
includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments for which significant
unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments.

Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
There are no offsetting arrangements. Financial assets and liabilities are settled and disclosed on a gross basis.
During the two reporting periods covered by these annual financial statements, there were no movements between
levels as a result of significant inputs to the fair valuation process becoming observable or unobservable.

The Bank leases a number of assets including land and buildings. Information about leases for which the Bank is
a lessee is presented below:
The Bank recognises a lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date.
The Bank uses an incremental borrowing rate that is based on the weighted average cost of deposits across the
years. The rates used to compute the present values of buildings lease liabilities as at 30 June 2023 was
10.81%. The adjustments were occurred due to changes in Incremental borrowing rate (IBR).
The Bank leases buildings for its office space and branches. The building leases typically run for a period
between 2 and 15 years with the majority of the contracts running for a period of 5 and 7 years. Some leases
include an option to renew the lease for an additional period at the end of the contract term. The renewal
term and lease rental cannot be reliably estimated before the end of a contract.
The Bank leases land for construction of its own office buildings. The land leases typically run for a period of
between 40 years and 70 years with majority of the contracts running for a period of 40 and 60 years. These
leases include an option to renew the lease.

Severance and Gratuity 
The income statement charge included within personnel expenses includes current service cost, interest cost
and past service costs on the defined benefit schemes and legal requirement.
The employee benefit plan is made up of two (2) unfunded schemes which are severance benefits that are
paid on voluntary withdrawal and retirement gratuity paid on retirement. These plans have been aggregated
in determining the retirement benefit obligation as the inherent risks applicable to these plans have been
assessed not to be materially different.
The key financial assumptions are the discount rate and the rate of salary increases. The provision for gratuity
was based on an independent actuarial valuation performed by QED Actuaries & Consultants (Pty) Ltd using
the projected unit credit method.
The Bank does not maintain any assets for the schemes but ensures that it has sufficient funds for the
obligations as they crystallise.

Below are the details of movements and amounts recognised in the financial statements:
The long service awards is the only applicable to employees that reach the retirement age. Employees who
attain this age while in a managerial position are entitled to 3 months final monthly salary while for other
employees, it is 2 months final salary. The scheme is not funded hence, there are no plan assets.
Bank Paid Benefits
The bank valued severance benefits payable on death or resignation after a minimum of 5 years’ service only
for all employees, as it is applied by the Bank.
Furthermore, one months’ salary is divided by 30 to get the daily salary applied in the severance benefit
calculation.
The severance benefits are based on statutory severance benefits in Ethiopia. The statutory severance
benefits are set out in Labour Proclamation No. 1156/2019. This benefit is summarised below:
Clause 39 (1) (h) of the Labour Proclamation sets out that any worker who has completed their probation and
who is not eligible for pension is entitled to a severance benefit:
h) Where he has given service to the employer for a minimum of five years’ service and his contract of
employment is terminated because of sickness or death or his contract of employment is terminated on his
own initiative provided that he has no contractual obligation relating to training to render service to the
employer
Clause 40 of the Labour Proclamation sets out the amount of the benefit, as follows:
The benefit applicable would be:
• thirty times the average daily wages of their last week of service for the first year of service, with part-
years pro-rata, plus
• ten times the average daily wages of their last week of service for each completed year of service after the
first.
To a maximum of one years’ wages payable to the member.Where the Company closes or reduces its work
force, an additional multiple of sixty times the average daily wages of their last week of service is payable.

 Mortality rate 
The rate of mortality assumed for employees are those published in the Demographic and Health Survey
(“DHS”) 2016 report compiled by the CSA. The DHS report provides male and female mortality rates for 5 year
age bands from age 15 to age 49. For ages over 47 we have assumed that mortality will be in line with the
SA85/90 ultimate standard South African mortality tables published by the Actuarial Society of South Africa
(“ASSA”), since the rates in these tables are similar to the DHS female mortality rate at age 47. These rates
combined are approximately summarized as follows:
The withdrawal rates are believed to be reasonably representative of the Ethiopian experience. The valuation
assumed a rate of withdrawal of 15% at the youngest ages falling with increasing age to 2.5% at age 45.

There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior
years. The average duration of the gratuity scheme at the end of the reporting period is five years (30 June
2022: five years).
 Impact on defined benefit obligation 
 30 June 2023 
 30 June 2022 
The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions
constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same
method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at
the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within
the statement of financial position.

The NBE Directive No. SBB/4/95 requires the Bank to transfer annually 25% of its annual net profit to its legal
reserve account until such account equals its capital. When the legal reserve account equals the capital of the
Bank, the amount to be transferred to the legal reserve account will be 10% (ten percent) of the annual net
profit.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares
outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. There were no potentially dilutive
shares at the reporting date (30 June 2021:nil), hence the basic and diluted earnings per share have the same
value.
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the profit after taxation by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

(b) The non-distributable reserve should be classified under Tier 1 as part of the core capital.
Provisions under prudential guidelines are determined using the time based provisioning prescribed by the
National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) Directives. This is at variance with the expected credit loss model required by
IFRS under IFRS 9. As a result of the differences in the provision, there will be variances in the impairments
allowances required under the two methodologies. Similarly, interest on non-performing loans are suspended
as per NBE directive, while IFRS 9 prescribes to recognize stage 3 loans interest income net of impairement
losses.  
The proclamation ‘Financial Reporting Proclamation No.847/2014 stipulates that Banks would be required to
make provisions for financial assets as prescribed in the relevant IFRS Standards when IFRS is adopted.
However, Banks would be required to comply with the following:
(a) Provisions for loans & advances and other assets are recognised in the income statement based on the
requirements of IFRS. However, the IFRS provision should be compared with provisions determined under the
NBE Directives and the expected impact/changes in other reserves are treated as follows:
• Prudential provisions is greater than IFRS provisions; the excess resulting should be transferred from the
general reserve (retained earnings) account to a “regulatory risk reserve”.
• Interest suspended in the previous years and regularized in the current year is compared with current year
stage 3 loans interest income recognized net of impairment losses. The difference between the two is
transferred to “regulatory risk reserve”.
• Prudential provisions is less than IFRS provisions; IFRS determined provision is charged to the statement of
comprehensive income. The cumulative balance in the regulatory risk reserve is thereafter reversed to the
general reserve account.

Claims and litigation
The Bank is a party to numerous legal actions brought by different organizations and individuals arising from
its normal business operations. Other the other hand, the Bank has various litigation claims arising from its
normal business operations. The maximum outflow and inflow of exposure from/to the Bank for these legal
cases as at 30 June 2023 is ETB 9.452 million and ETB 57.118 million (2022: ETB 1.556 million and ETB 35.067
million) respectively.
The Bank conducts business involving bonds and guarantees. These instruments are given as a security to
support the performance of a customer to third parties. As the Bank will only be required to meet these
obligations in the event of the customer's default, the cash requirements of these instruments are expected to
be considerably below their nominal amounts.
The table below summarises the fair value amount of contingent liabilities for the account of customers:
The Bank has commitments, not provided for in these financial statements for the year 30 June 2023 is ETB
24.095 billion (30 June 2022: ETB 22.698 billion), being exposure of the Bank from commercial letters of
credit, guarantees to customers, loan commitments and other commitments. Other commitments represent
commitments made in respect of the estimated cost to complete the Bank's construction work in progress.
