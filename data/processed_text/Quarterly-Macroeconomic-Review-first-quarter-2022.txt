Macroeconomic Developments and Outlook 
 
• 
Overview: Ethiopia’s economy faced six distinct shocks this past quarter, including major 
price spikes in global markets as well as domestic shocks linked to conflict and drought.  
 
o Global shocks: Four items—namely fuel, food, fertilizers, and freight—will be costing 
Ethiopia an extra $4bn this year and raising total imports from $14bn to $18bn.  
o Domestic shocks: The devastating recent conflict and worst drought in decades will, in 
turn, be bringing record high budgetary spending for security, relief, and recovery.   
 
• 
Holding it Together: To keep macro conditions intact, the Government is responding with 
a mix of policies that involves adjusting to the shocks (through cuts to budgeted capital 
expenditure and reduced fx allocations to the private sector) while also relying on financing 
measures that moderate the impact of these shocks (higher budget deficits, still-high 
monetary growth, and a higher drawdown of fx reserves). On the balance of payments 
side, the big increase in world prices for the “Four Fs” (fuel, food, fertilizers, freight) is being 
covered by reductions in private capital imports, by higher exports/services/remittances, 
by greater fx supplies from franco valuta importers (who now make up over half of non-
fuel imports), and by a drawdown of NBE reserves. On the fiscal side, the government’s 
large spending increase is being funded by increased domestic borrowing (mainly from the 
T-Bill market) but also through cuts to federal capital expenditure (only 34% of which is 
being executed). This mix of policies is keeping fiscal/BOP positions in check, with both 
budget and current account deficits unlikely to exceed 4% of GDP this year. In the monetary 
area, the central bank’s policy response has been to slow the Birr’s monthly depreciation—
seemingly to limit inflation—from an annual ‘run rate’ of 33% last year to just 4% at 
present, though growth in money supply (M2) remains high at 25% above year-ago levels.  
 
• 
Risks: While the current mix of policies is limiting macro imbalances in a difficult domestic 
and global environment, there are potentially emerging risks. If prolonged, for example, the 
cutbacks being relied upon—in government capital expenditure, in capital goods imports, 
and in fx supplies to the private sector—would reduce long-term investment/exports, lower 
growth, and aggravate inflation. In all likelihood, however, these are exceptional and 
temporary measures used only for exceptional and temporary circumstances. 
 
• 
Outlook: Looking ahead, successfully riding out the global shocks (via a balanced mix of adjustment/financing policies until 
commodity price spikes gradually dissipate) and moving towards a deeper post-conflict re-engagement with external partners 
(donors, lenders) represent two key turning points that would bring a major improvement in Ethiopia’s macro conditions. The exact 
timing for both remains uncertain, of course, but we presume the second half of 2022 is a possibility and this forms the basis for our 
macro projections. Accordingly, we still see strong growth returning only next fiscal year and think minimal GDP growth is likely this 
fiscal year given presumed crop/activity shortfalls in Northern regions plus the tight fx/credit conditions of recent quarters (the 
Government forecasts growth of 6.6% and the IMF 3.8% for this fiscal year, though these projections may partly reflect the exclusion 
of conflict-affected areas where data collection—on crops, economic activity, inflation—is not possible under current conditions). 
On other aspects of the macro outlook, we anticipate: (1) inflation remaining elevated for the rest of 2022 and for most of 2023 (25% 
by end-2022, 15% by June 2023); (2) a fiscal deficit just below 4% of GDP as previously expected; (3) a higher current account deficit 
given global price shocks (~4% of GDP this year vs ~3% of GDP last year); (4) continued BOP pressures—and thus severe fx challenges 
for private businesses—till late 2022 but with modest improvements likely thereafter; and (5) an exchange rate crawl that follows 
the slower pace of recent months and thus takes the Birr rate to 52 per USD by June 2022 and 55 per USD by end-2022.

Economic Activity—Real Sector Indicators, Part 1 
 
• High frequency indicators reveal strong growth for some BOP indicators (notably exports, imports, remittances, and FDI), 
drops in foreign grants and loans inflows, and mostly negative real growth rates—after accounting for inflation—for fiscal 
and monetary indicators such as revenue and deposits.  
 
• The revenue and profits of Ethiopia’s largest enterprises (SOEs) as well as its commercial banks are growing strongly in 
real terms, suggesting strength in the formal economy, but a number of manufacturing indicators (cement production, 
capital goods imports) suggest weakening in that particular sub-segment.

Economic Activity—Real Sector Indicators, Part 2 
 
• Investment trends show a mixed picture so far in the fiscal year.  
 
• Government capital expenditure and capital goods imports are both registering notable declines. On the other hand, 
measures of SOE capital investment (proxied by their bond borrowing from banks) and of foreign investment have shown 
positive growth for the first nine months of the fiscal year vs the same period in the prior year. 
 
• On balance, given the large role of government capital expenditure and domestic private investment, we expect it is likely 
that the investment-to-GDP ratio will trend slightly lower to 27% of GDP for the fiscal year.

Economic Activity—Real Sector Indicators, Part 3 
 
• Seen sequentially, monthly activity indicators point to still expanding export levels across several sub-categories, whether 
for total exports, industrial park exports, or textile exports. Two other strong fx sources—tourist inflows and remittances—
are also showing a trend improvement despite high volatility in the monthly data.  One indicator of construction activity, 
cement output, is declining though this may reflect production challenges rather than weakening demand in the sector. 
 
• Despite Ethiopia’s removal from AGOA (duty-free) trade privileges to the US, textile exports from industrial parks have 
actually risen in the first quarter of 2022 (to $46mn for the quarter), compared both to year-ago levels ($34mn) and 
compared to the average seen in the two quarters immediately preceding the removal from AGOA ($45mn).

• Key monetary and fiscal indicators are up substantially in nominal terms, though given year-on-year inflation of near 36 
percent as of April 2022, most such indicators are actually shrinking in real terms.  
 
• As noted earlier, data for state enterprise revenue and profits (six-month basis) as well as for foreign investment (nine-
months basis) are showing strong expansion even in inflation-adjusted or USD terms.

Economic Activity—Real Sector Indicators, Part 5 
 
• Looking more closely at the performance of Ethiopia’s largest state enterprises, growth in revenue and in profits is 
particularly strong for those involved in the transport sector (Ethiopian Airlines, Ethiopian Shipping), financial sector (CBE, 
DBE), trading, and manufacturing. More moderate growth is seen for enterprises in agriculture and communications.  
 
• The strong revenue growth of most state enterprises, even after adjusting for inflation, suggests continued strength in 
parts of the formal economy, though it is notable that the fastest growing segments are not a very large share of Ethiopia’s 
overall GDP (transport and communications together comprises 5% of real GDP while finance is 3% of real GDP).

Economic Activity—Real Sector Indicators, Part 6 
 
• Reflecting the trends summarized earlier, we retain our view that minimal GDP growth of near 1 percent is likely for this 
fiscal year, given material crop output declines that are presumed to have taken place in northern Ethiopia and the tight 
credit/fx conditions that have prevailed for most of the past fiscal year, especially in the July-December 2021 period.  
 
• By contrast, the Government forecasts growth of 6.6 percent and the IMF 3.8 percent for this fiscal year, though these 
projections seem to us to reflect the exclusion of conflict-affected areas for which data collection—on crops, economic 
activity, inflation—is not possible under current conditions.  These growth projections imply that crop output declines in 
northern regions have been more than fully offset by recent low-land wheat irrigation initiatives and/or by the strength 
of activity seen in other parts of the formal economy (i.e., in services and manufacturing).  
 
• It is likely that the final growth figure for 2021-22 (when reported in late 2022) will end up being very close to the 6.6 
percent nine-month figure forecast by Government.  If so, nominal GDP is set to surpass Birr 6 trillion for this fiscal year 
(ending June 2022) vs the Birr 5.8 trillion that we are currently projecting.

• Inflation has exceeded 30% for nearly a year now and has settled in the mid-30s range for six consecutive months.  
 
• The largest contributors to inflation as of April 2022 continue to reflect mostly food items (cereal grains, cooking oil, 
vegetables, and beverages), all of which showed year-on-year price increase of more than 30%. Below-average inflation is 
being observed for education, utilities, and clothing (near 25%) while minimal inflation is seen for communications 
(reflecting mainly flat or falling prices for telecom services).

• The large price spikes being seen for global commodities such wheat, maize, cooking oil, and fuel are being closely mirrored 
in local retail prices. 
 
• For fuel prices, which have a major role in feeding through to other domestic prices, a decision to gradually remove 
subsidies is narrowing the gap between trends in global oil prices and local retail fuel prices.  Still, there has been only a 
partial pass-through of global prices, as with local benzine prices are now up roughly 50 percent since end-2020 (from Birr 
22 to Birr 32 per liter) though global oil prices rose by over 100 percent over the same period (from $50 to $105 per barrel).

Economic Activity—Real Sector Indicators, Part 10 
 
• While month-on-month inflation has averaged 2.7 percent over the past year, it peaked at a recent high of 4% in March 
2022 and has since moderated somewhat to 2.2% in April 2022. The most recent m-o-m rate of April 2022, which would 
normally provide the best signal of near-term trends, implies 29 percent inflation on an annualized basis. 
 
• The consensus view on the direction of global commodity prices seems—on balance—to be that they will stay elevated 
and possibly trend even higher due to given widening export bans affecting wheat/fuel/cooking oil markets as well as 
supply bottlenecks still clogging up freight/shipping markets. Accordingly, our inflation projections for the coming few 
months assume high month-on-month price increases of 2.5 to 3.0 percent, which imply year-on-year rates of 37-38 
percent for the near term. For the latter half of 2022, year-on-year inflation rates should steadily trend downwards as 
global commodity price shocks gradually dissipate (thus bringing lower m-o-m inflation rates), as the food harvest season 
comes into play (October to December), and as favourable base effects (i.e., the very high levels of the price index last 
year) translate into declining year-on-year inflation rates.

Monetary Developments and Outlook, Part 1 
 
• The growth in money supply (M2) has ticked up slightly in the latest quarter, reaching 25 percent as of end-March 2022 
versus 24 percent at end-December 2021. Money supply is now close to Birr 1.6 trillion, or 27% of GDP. 
 
• Growth in net credit to the government has been running at a rate of 100%-plus for the past two consecutive quarters, 
with a doubling seen in the credit to government from Birr 119bn at end-March 2021 to Birr 358bn at end-March 2022.

Monetary Developments and Outlook, Part 2 
 
• In line with trends seen at end-2021, there is a deceleration in the growth of credit to the non-government sector (to state 
enterprises and private sector), which is now up by 17% from year-ago levels (vs 25% growth rates seen in recent years). 
 
• Reflecting the slower growth of recent quarters, the share of credit to the non-government sector relative to GDP is also 
trending downwards, falling to an estimated 23% of GDP as of March 2022 from a peak of 32% in 2019. 
 
• Our estimate of credit to the private sector (derived by taking out state enterprise borrowing from reported credit to the 
‘non-government sector’) suggests a slight recent decline is offsetting the trend improvement seen in recent years.  
Approximately 45 percent of the stock of total credit is going to the private sector (down from 49%) while the share of 
new credit flows going to the private sector is only 21 percent, by our estimates, reflecting the large and exceptional credit 
allocations to the Government this fiscal year.

Monetary Developments and Outlook, Part 3 
 
• While growth in bank deposits and loans had slowed somewhat in late 2021 (to around 22%), both have more recently 
shown an uptick to near 26%-29% annual growth as of March 2022. These growth rates are in line with M2 growth of 25%.  
 
• Lending at private banks is proceeding at a faster pace (32 percent) than is the case at the CBE (23 percent). By sector, the 
trade sectors are showing the highest growth rates (loans are up 55% and 37% respectively for imports and exports), and 
in fact these are the only two sectors showing real (inflation-adjusted) growth in bank loans. All other loans are growing 
at a rate lower than inflation, and substantially so for sectors such as industry and construction.  
 
• Bank earnings data for the nine months to March 2022 show substantial growth in profits (provisional basis), both at CBE 
and at private banks.

Monetary Developments and Outlook, Part 4 
 
• Given high inflation, trends in many monetary variables give an exaggerated impression of strong growth. In fact, except 
for credit to the government, most other monetary aggregates show growth rates that are below the rate of inflation and 
are declining relative to nominal GDP. Even for net credit to government, while this has risen sharply in nominal terms, it 
only amounts to 1 percentage point of GDP increase, from 4 percent two years ago to 5 percent in March 2022. 
 
• It is also notable that, seen in a cross-country context, Ethiopia’s monetization and financial deepening ratios remain low 
and stagnant relative to GDP. Most peer countries have M2/GDP ratios—a metric of financial sector deepening—that are 
well above those seen in Ethiopia, such as for Kenya, Egypt, Ghana, South Africa, Vietnam, and India.

Fiscal Developments and Outlook, Part 1 
 
• Fiscal outturns for the first six months show revenue of Birr 179bn, expenditure of B irr 297bn and a first half of year deficit 
of Birr 118bn. Per the 2021-22 budget, the deficit initially targeted was Birr 126bn for the full fiscal year. 
 
• Nine-month data for revenue show growth in nominal terms but are negative in real terms and imply an annualized 
revenue/GDP figure of well below 10 percent (annual revenue of Birr 460bn against a nominal GDP anticipated of Birr 
5,860bn would translate into a ratio of 8 percent).  
 
• Preliminary data reported for nine-month fiscal outturns further suggest revenue of Birr 266bn, expenditure of Birr 434bn, 
for a nine-month deficit of Birr 145bn (and an implied budget deficit figure of close to Birr 200bn when annualized).

Fiscal Developments and Outlook, Part 2 
 
• The nine-month increase in Government debt—which is indicative of the underlying fiscal deficit—has reached Birr 220bn 
or already 3.9 percent of GDP, per Ministry of Finance debt data.   
 
• All of the debt increase seen for the past nine months can be said to have been financed fully from domestic sources, as 
there was actually a net repayment of foreign loans during this period (central government external debt fell from 
$19.485bn to $19.218bn between end-June 2021 and end-March 2022, equivalent to a decline of Birr 13bn).

Fiscal Developments and Outlook, Part 3 
 
• The Government’s domestic borrowing has been facilitated by a deepening Treasury Bill market, which is now providing 
Birr 288bn in financing versus just Birr 23bn in 2020 (a 12x increase in two years). As of end-March 2022, the largest share 
of T-Bills sold were 364-day bills (62%) and 182-day bills (25%), easing the pressure on Government to keep rolling over 
short-dated T-Bills (of 28-days and 91-days), which previously provided the bulk of the financing.  
 
• Effective borrowing rates continue to be very favorable (for the government), as they have stayed within the range of 8-
10 percent and remain substantially negative in real terms.

Fiscal Developments and Outlook, Part 4 
 
• One important means of limiting the budget deficit has been the use of cutbacks in spending on previously budgeted 
items. In this respect, while the budget on recurrent items is more or less exactly in line with the budget, only 47 percent 
of the regional grants budget and only 34 percent of the capital budget is being spent. 
 
• The implication of the large cutbacks in government capital expenditure are that many infrastructure -related projects will 
be held back, at the expense of future growth.  Based on the approved budget in June 2021, the capex items most likely 
to be affected are road-building, urban infrastructure, education (mainly universities), health, and irrigation projects.

Fiscal Developments and Outlook, Part 5 
 
• Public debt stands at $57bn as of March 2022, up by $3bn from year-ago levels. All of this is due to an increase in (Birr 
denominated) domestic public debt, reflecting the government’s expanded borrowing, while foreign debt is actually down 
by $1bn in nominal USD terms (due to a drop in new foreign loans and on-going external debt repayments). 
 
• Relative to GDP, public debt levels continue to show a steady decline and have now fallen to below 49 percent given this 
year’s expected USD GDP of $120bn (Birr 5,861bn nominal GDP and year-average exchange rate of 48.9 Birr/USD). 
 
• Public sector debt service is on pace to surpass $2bn this fiscal year, given $1.6bn of payments already recorded from July 
2021 to March 2022. Most public sector debt service is actually affected by state enterprises, and only about one-fourth 
of the total paid in the last nine months ($426mn of the $1,646mn) were obligations of the Government.

Fiscal Developments and Outlook, Part 6 
 
• Looking more closely at domestic debt, which has become the primary source of government funding this year, the main 
lenders to the Government are—in descending order—the NBE, CBE, pension funds, and private banks.  More private 
banks are now active participants in the T-Bill market, with the share of Government debt provided by private banks 
reaching 8 percent of the total, from just 1 percent two years ago.  
 
• By instrument, Treasury Bills are now the dominant source of domestic financing, providing 35 percent of Government’s 
domestic debt. In line with policy commitments to reduce reliance on central bank financing, the share of domestic debt 
provided by NBE direct advances had fallen sharply from 50% to a low of 7% in recent years, but there has been a moderate 
reversal on this score as direct central bank advances are now back up to 18% of Government’s domestic debt.

External Sector Developments and Outlook, Part 1 
 
• Exports continues to be a bright spot within Ethiopia’s overall macro performance, and 21 percent year-on-year growth is 
now likely for the year based on nine-month trends.  The increase is almost exclusively due to exports of coffee (volumes 
up 44%, prices up 25%), which are on track to reach a historic record of $1bn for the year. 
 
• A record high import level—of near $18bn—is also expected this year, reflecting large increases in global commodity 
prices. Fuel imports are up 70% and food (cereal) imports up 121%, with both showing $1bn higher imports just in the first 
nine months vs same period last year. Imports would have been higher still had it not been for a sharp cutback in capital 
goods imports (down 26%), reflecting long forex waiting times and reduced fx allocations to the private sector.

External Sector Developments and Outlook, Part 2 
 
• One notable aspect of recent import trends is the sharp rise in franco valuta imports, which doubled from quarterly levels 
of near $0.8bn in 2020 to quarterly levels of $1.8bn now. These imports that are not financed by letters of credit originated 
in Ethiopia (via local banks) but rather paid for by importers through whatever fx sources may be accessible to them.  Such 
imports would include foreign investors financing their imports from own funds, diaspora importers who may have access 
to fx from income generated abroad, or local traders/companies who may access fx funds through various means.  
 
• Franco valuta imports are set to reach close to $8bn this fiscal year and will make up a just over half of total non-fuel 
imports. In effect, over half of Ethiopia’s imports (excluding fuel, which is imported by government) are now being 
financed by fx sources that are not provided by—and emanate outside of—the domestic banking system.

• The latest available data on official fx reserves data are as of end-December 2021 and reveal NBE fx reserves of $1.6bn 
(down from $2.8bn as of June 2021), and roughly similar commercial bank fx assets of $1.7bn. The official fx reserves is 
now the lowest it has been for over a decade and represents close to 1 month of imports.   
 
• NBE data for combined fx assets of the banking system (NBE and banks) as of end-March 2022 shows a figure $3bn. 
Assuming commercial bank fx assets have remained at their average level seen over the last four quarters (namely $1.4bn 
for the Dec 2020 to Dec 2021 period), this then implies that NBE’s fx reserves figure has stabilized at around $1.5bn to 
$1.6bn during the January-March 2022 quarter.  This would not be surprising given the 70% fx surrender requirement 
(applied on commercial banks since end-2021) now providing a steady stream of fx funds that adds to NBE reserves.

External Sector Developments and Outlook, Part 4 
 
• Trends in the prices and yields of Ethiopia’s sole Eurobond continue to suggest a deteriorating assessment of macro 
conditions by foreign portfolio investors. However, the Eurobond is not a particularly meaningful proxy of macro 
performance in Ethiopia’s case: the pricing mainly reflects the fact that Ethiopia has applied for debt service relief under 
the ‘Common Framework’ (a G-20/IMF initiative meant to assist developing countries cope with the COVID pandemic) and 
bondholders’ expectations that they would be subject to some form of debt treatment in a prospective debt rescheduling.  
 
• In reality, given the Eurobond’s small share of total debt ($1bn out of $57bn, or below 2%) and its consequently muted 
debt service impact, it is likely that the Eurobond will not be included in any upcoming creditor treatment of external debt.   
 
• Given the multiple global commodity price shocks of recent months, Ethiopia stands among 22 countries whose sovereign 
debt now shows a yield of more than 10 percent in USD terms. Unlike several of these countries, however, Ethiopia has 
not defaulted on its external debt and has been fully meeting its foreign debt service obligations last year and this year.

External Sector Developments and Outlook, Part 5 
 
• Despite what would be expected in an environment of severe BOP pressures, the pace of Birr depreciation has slowed 
sharply in recent months. The average monthly depreciation fell to 41 cents in April and 17 cents in May 2022, versus an 
average monthly depreciation of 81 cents during 2021. The annual depreciation rate from year-ago levels was 19.9 percent 
in May 2022, down from the annual depreciation rates of more than 25 percent seen through most of 2021.  
 
• The gap between the official and parallel market rate has trended upwards in recent months, and is now well above 35%. 
The implied greater demand for dollars in the parallel market seems to reflect the combined impact of: (1) the slower pace 
of depreciation in the official market; (2) the lagged effect of the fx surrender requirements that came into being in late 
2021 (which reduced bank fx supply to the private sector); and (3) possibly higher demand arising from franco valuta 
importers, as is being suggested by many market observers.

External Sector Developments and Outlook, Part 6 
 
• Looking ahead, the slower monthly depreciation of recent months implies a much lower annual ‘run-rate’ if the path of 
depreciation were to continue at its current pace.  For example, while the 130 cents depreciation of December 2021 
implied an annual (forward-looking) run-rate of 33%, the latest May 2022 depreciation of 17 cents implies an annual 
depreciation—assuming the current pace—of just 4 percent for the year ahead.  
 
• While the central bank’s exchange rate policy previously seemed to give precedence to competitiveness concerns, thus 
ensuring depreciation rates matched or exceeded inflation rates, the exceptionally high domestic/global inflation of recent 
months appear to have altered the central bank’s policy priorities in this area. Minimizing any factors (including the 
exchange rate) that aggravate inflation is—it seems—being accorded greater importance given current circumstances.  
 
• In light of these apparent policy recent shifts, we presume that a slower exchange rate crawl will guide exchange rate 
policy for the rest of 2022 and thus see the Birr at 52.1 per USD for June 2022 and 54.9. per USD for end-2022.

External Sector Developments and Outlook, Part 7 
 
• The impact of four major global price shocks—namely for fuel, food, fertilizer, and freight—will add an extra $4bn in fx 
outflows this fiscal year. Several other line-items will also contribute to a further deterioration in BOP flows, including 
service imports (up by $0.6bn), loans (down by $0.4bn) and grants (down by $0.4bn).  
 
• Offsetting these adverse developments, improvements are expected for service exports (up by $1.3bn), goods exports (up 
by $0.8bn), remittances (up by $0.8bn), and borrowing by SOEs (up by $0.4bn, mainly due to Ethiopian Airlines).

External Sector Developments and Outlook, Part 8 
 
• Taking into account the net effect of all balance of payment flows, we project an overall deficit of $1.3bn for the year, 
paralleling the drop in official reserves from $2.8bn last June to an expected $1.55bn by end of this fiscal year (June 2022).  
 
• The BOP deterioration has occurred despite 
a 20%-plus Birr depreciation, implying it 
would have been even higher had the 
currency not declined by as much as it did. 
It is also worth noting that the observed 
BOP deficit and reserves drawdown is itself 
limited to only $1.3bn because excess 
demand under the current exchange rate 
regime is simply reflected in longer queues 
and longer waiting times for those seeking 
access to foreign exchange. Eliminating 
such excess demand would of course 
require a fundamental shift in Ethiopia’s 
managed exchange rate regime, whose 
reform remains a government priority but 
has been put on pause on account of 
prevailing domestic and global conditions. 
In the interim, the policy mix of making 
some policy adjustments and tolerating 
unmet fx demand (via queueing) continues 
to ‘hold together’ the balance of payments, 
though such a state of affairs will contribute 
to a build-up of major economic stresses 
and undermine future growth the longer it 
is prolonged. 
 
• Pending major reform in the exchange rate 
regime, an improvement in near-term 
foreign exchange conditions is nonetheless 
still possible if global commodity prices 
moderate from their current highs and 
when a deeper (post-conflict) engagement 
is re-established with donors, lenders, 
investors, and trading partners. Both are a 
reasonable prospect in the second half of 
2022, and this presumed backdrop forms 
the baseline assumption for our overall 
macro outlook and projections as laid out in 
Appendix 1.
