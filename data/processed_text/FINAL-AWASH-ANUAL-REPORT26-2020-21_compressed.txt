delivering higher returns to its shareholders. 
Over recent years, the Bank has increased 
income, capital and dividend paid out with a 
track record of creating a significant value for its 
owners.  
 
The accomplishment of the Bank as at June 
30, 2021 on its major operational activities is 
exceedingly higher when compared with the 
performances of the preceding year.  Accordingly, 
during the year under review, the aggregate 
deposit increased by 46% and reached Birr 108.1 
billion, loans and advances surged by 52.8% and 
reached Birr 87.5 billion, income escalated by 
34.6% and stood at Birr 13.7 billion and the gross 
profit grew by 34% and reached Birr 4.8 billion. 
The gross operating profit registered during 
the year in particular, is unique of its kind in the 
history of the private banks and the history of 
Awash Bank itself, reflecting the underlying 
strengths of the AB’s business.
The increments registered in the major 
performances of the Bank in general, and that 
of income and gross profit in particular, are 
because of the strong efforts made bank-wide 
to maximize the wallet-share of the Bank. The 
other major contributory factors are the efforts 
exerted in the resource mobilization activities 
and also the continuous hard work applied 
in the collection of loans and advances, as a 
D
istinguished Shareholders, Stakeholders, 
Honorable Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen!!
It is my honor and great pleasure to welcome 
you all, on behalf of the Board of Directors 
and on my own behalf, to the 26th Awash 
Bank’s Shareholders’ Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) of the FY 2020/21. I would also like to 
extend my heartfelt appreciation to our valued 
Customers, dedicated Management Members 
and all hard working Employees of the Bank 
for their continued trust, unshakable backing 
and commitments delivered to our Bank all the 
years that enabled the Bank to register yet 
again another shinning result in all spheres of 
its operational activities during the FY 2020/21. 
Moreover, it is my strong belief that your 
multifaceted support will continue to make your 
Bank to remain the pioneer leading private bank 
in the country during the coming years. 
The FY 2020/21 was the year of full of challenges 
and uncertainty to the country in general, and to 
the banking industry in particular. Some of the 
challenges were the elevated political instability 
in some parts of the country, inflation, impact of 
COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and stiff
 
competition among the different banks. In spite 
of these considerable hurdles and challenges, 
however, Awash Bank operated efficiently 
and once again has recorded a commendable 
performance and a unique result of its kind 
during the FY 2020/21. It is also important to 
mention that the Bank’s annual achievement 
was by far greater than the cascaded yearly 
target planned to be implemented, on the fifth 
year of the Ten Years Strategy Transformation 
of the Bank’s  ‘’Vision 2025 Project’’.
Through its past experiences, Awash Bank 
showed a continued progress in building a 
stronger and safer Bank that is capable of

result of which the status of Non-Performing 
Loans (NPLs) has remained less than 2% as at 
end of June 30, 2021. In general, the registered 
significant performances of the Bank were 
the sum of the wise guidance of the Board of 
Directors, the prudent and coordinated quality 
leadership of the Senior and Middle-Level 
Management Members as well as the unreserved 
commitment of the entire staff of the Bank who 
deserve commendations of the Board.
Likewise, it is believed that the efforts made and 
the fast-track actions taken by the Board during 
the year for fundamental changes & ensuring 
sustainable 
& 
profitable 
growth 
through 
excellence in operation, technology & ultimately 
customer experience has contributed to the 
success of the Bank out of which the following 
major points are to be mentioned:
•	
The approval of the new organizational 
structure of the Bank, which composes 
a wide range of additional new positions, 
including Chief Officers, D/Chief Officers, 
Directors, 
D/Directors 
and 
Division 
Managers;
•	
The approval of the new salary scale, that 
is commensurate with the growth level 
of the Bank and that helps to maintain its 
own staff and also attract others from the 
market;
•	
Recognition of the Senior & Middle Level 
Management Members and outstanding 
employees of the Bank;
•	
Reducing the interest rate charges on the 
staff loans (for the purchase of houses, 
vehicles and others) to the minimum 
savings deposit interest rate level of 7% 
and
•	
The approval of essential policy matters 
and the encouragement made in the 
branch expansion and introduction of new 
Information Technology products. 
Awash Bank also engages in many different 
project activities, namely, IT Projects, Strategy 
Development Projects and the Construction of 
own Building Projects. 
Regarding the IT Projects, considering the fact 
that the banking sector has become increasingly 
tech-driven, the Bank has been focusing on 
vendor related IT Projects and internally 
developed systems & solutions by the IT staff
 
of the Bank. Through both ways the Bank is 
improving the status of adapting & implementing 
modern Information Technologies. 
The Strategy Development Projects include, 
among others, the development of Digital 
Financial Services Strategy, SME banking 
Strategy and PMS.  As for PMS implementation, 
after developing the PMS guidelines in-house, 
the Bank cascaded it at all levels of the Bank and 
the project is now fully implemented at Branches 
and the Head Office levels. 
In an effort to strengthen its asset base, and to 
ensure long term and sustainable growth, the 
Bank focused on the construction of its own 
buildings at different strategic areas. The Bank 
has already built image representing buildings 
at some Regional Towns, including the two 
buildings in Addis Ababa City. The third building 
in Addis Ababa City is the 13-storey Bulbula 
Mixed-use Building, the construction work of 
which has now reached 8th floor.  Furthermore, 
the Bank has acquired plots of land both at Bale 
Robe and Asella Towns and their construction 
works are in good progress. In addition, with 
the desire to construct its own new Head-
Quarters Building in proportion to its image and 
size, Awash Bank is looking for the provision 
of favorable construction site, particularly 
at the financial institutions zone, around the 
National Theatre area. The Addis Ababa City 
Administration has approved and promised the 
Bank to handover an ideal place and it is hoped 
that the handing over of the plot of land would 
materialize during the FY 2021/22. Side by side, 
the Bank is also making continuous efforts to 
buy built up buildings for its branch operations. 
Concerning the Human Resource Management, 
the Board believes that having an engaged & 
motivated workforce & a sound governance 
& risk management are pivotal to attain the 
sustainable growth and the vision that the Bank 
aspires for, which is to be ‘’One of the Top Ten 
East African Banks’’. In this regard, the Human 
Resource Management Policies and Procedures 
of the Bank were revised to enable attracting, 
motivating and retaining qualified and skilled 
manpower. To make it practical, steps were taken

On  top of  its  corporate objectives, the contribution 
of the Bank to the growth of the National Economy 
and the wellbeing of its citizens during the year 
is conspicuous as observed from the annual tax 
paid, the financial contributions made for the 
national development projects of the country 
(Gebeta Lehager), the bond purchase made in 
support of the construction of the Grand Ethiopian 
Renaissance Dam (GERD) and the corporate social 
responsibilities fulfilled to different organizations 
working on social & developmental activities.
In conclusion, on behalf of the Board of 
Directors, I want to once again express my 
sincere gratitude to all Shareholders, Customers, 
Business Partners and other Stakeholders for 
their unwavering and indispensable support of 
the Bank’s efforts.  My special thank goes to 
the relevant authorities, management members 
and the entire employees, for their passion and 
commitment, belongingness and hard work to 
upswing their Bank, in delivering commendable 
results and enabling the Bank to maintain its 
pioneer leading position among the private 
commercial Banks in the country.
I would like to commend the National Bank 
of Ethiopia (NBE) for providing our Bank a 
constructive guidance and enthusiastic support. 
I also wish to thank Awash Bank’s customers for 
working with us and the confidence they have 
on our Bank. Moreover, I look forward to their 
continuous commitment to work with the Bank 
in the future to come.
Finally, recalling that the Bank has come a long 
way so far, and has still a long way to go, I want 
to assure you that in the years to come, our Bank 
will strongly scrutinize the laid down Vision 
and Strategy to bring about further excellence 
by 
exploiting 
opportunities 
and 
vigilantly 
withstanding the challenging environment. 
Thank you,
to improve manpower efficiency, focusing on 
optimizing the existing resource through internal 
job postings, transfers and skill development/
capacity building initiatives.   
The nature of the business also requires 
massive re-skilling of the existing workforce and 
continuous skill upgrading through in-house 
or outsourced trainings. With this in mind, the 
Bank has organized and implemented short-
term trainings for its staff inside and outside 
the country and also sponsored certain number 
of staff to pursue higher education at different 
levels during the year under review. 
I want to stress at this point that the Board and 
the Management are courageous to work hard 
during the financial year 2021/22, in spite of 
the continuing fierce competition amongst the 
Banks and the persistence of the impacts of 
coronavirus pandemic. The Board is also fully 
confident that Awash Bank shall remain the 
leading Private Commercial Bank in the country. 
 
In addition, given the dedication of the Board, 
the commitment of the Management Team, the 
competency of the entire employees and the 
results registered to date, the attainment of its 
grand vision of becoming “World Class Bank” is 
also inevitable! 
The Bank continues to deliver on its strategic 
commitments, which drive the operational 
performances 
and 
create 
value 
for 
the 
Shareholders as well as the communities at 
large. Both the Board and the Management are 
determined and dedicated as before to combine 
their skills and energies and have begun 
registering yet another superior performance 
to maintain AB’s leading position amongst the 
private   banks of the country.

A number of new banks, both conventional and 
interest free, were either under formation or 
officially commenced operation during the year. 
Some credit and saving share companies have 
also graduated from micro-finance institutions 
(MFIs) to a full-fledged commercial banks and 
started to become major players in the field. 
This has tightened the existing stiff competition 
among local banks for resources, both local and 
foreign.
The 30% foreign currency surrender requirement, 
which is still in place, has been eroding the 
foreign currency stock balance of the Bank and 
this has also been among the serious challenges 
encountered during the financial year.  
In spite of the above challenges, however, 
the following opportunities were available on 
the other side and our Bank was able to take 
advantage of same to the fullest extent possible.
1.	 Despite COVID-19 pandemic and instability 
in some parts of the country, the Foreign 
Direct Investment (FDI) secured and 
the commodity export performance of 
the country for the year just ended was 
F
irst of all, on behalf of the entire 
Management of Awash Bank and on my 
own behalf, I would like to commend 
my heart-felt gratitude to all respected 
Shareholders, dedicated Board of Directors, 
most valued Customers, committed and hard-
working Management and staff members as 
well as all other stakeholders of the Bank on a 
remarkable achievement our Bank has recorded 
in all financial and non-financial parameters for 
the financial year ended June 30, 2021.
The financial year just ended was undeniably very 
challenging. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), 
which was declared by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) as a global pandemic, has 
still persisted and continued to be a concerning 
health problem world-wide. Its economic, 
political, social and cultural ramifications on the 
well-being of societies across the globe have 
been unparalleled and the negative effect of 
the pandemic is still undesirably restrictive to 
almost all countries of the world. The Domino 
Effect of the health crisis has resulted in 
economic and social crisis although the effect 
was progressively recovering this year as 
compared to the preceding year.  
In general, the coronavirus has far-reaching 
consequence and as a result, business could 
not be as it used to be. Many economic sectors 
have been hard hit and our Bank has put in 
place some ameliorating mechanisms so that 
the destructive situation on business could 
somehow be managed and our customers would 
be able to sustain their business. 
Apart from the above, instability in some parts of 
the country and outbreak of war in the Northern 
Region has resulted in closure of branches and 
this has seriously affected our business.

commendable as compared to last year 
same period. As a result, the foreign 
currency earned by our Bank, nearly 
USD 902 Million, was better this year 
as compared to last year same period, 
which was USD 869 Million. This was an 
increment of USD 32 Million, or 3.8%.
2.	 The National Bank of Ethiopia issued 
Directive No. CMD/2/2020 on Legal Tender 
Currency Notes Redemption on September 
14, 2020. The currency redemption has 
gone and concluded extremely well and our 
Bank was able to mobilize a good sum of 
resources. A good number of new accounts 
has also been opened as a result. 
3.	 As per the decision of the Board, 50,400 
shares, worth Birr 50.4 Million, have 
been awarded to Senior Management, 
Middle Management and selected Branch 
Managers and this has greatly fortified the 
moral and belongingness of the awardees. 
Thanks to the Board, the remarkable 
performance of the Bank for the year 
just ended was a cumulative effect of this 
decision also,
4.	 According to African Business, “Africa’s 
Top 100 Banks 2020”, Awash Bank stood 
90 out of a total of 100 and 14 from East 
African banks. No East African banks have 
managed to gain a place in the Top 10 of the 
overall ranking of Africa’s Top 100 banks in 
2020. This has greatly enhanced the image 
of the Bank,
5.	 World Savings Banks Institute (WSBI) 
welcomed six new members at its recent 
Board and General Assembly and Awash 
Bank was one of the newly accepted 
members. 
The WSBI  helps members to boost their 
business 
development 
efforts, 
promote 
members’ best practices, transfer knowledge 
among members and foster cooperation. No 
doubt, being a member of the group will enhance 
the reputation of our Bank in the times to come.
 
These being the available opportunities, with a 
concerted effort of all, our Bank has performed 
extremely well in all parameters in the financial 
year just ended as can be seen below. 
Gross profit before tax stood at Birr 4.8 Billion 
from Birr 3.6 Billion of last year same period; 
i.e. Birr 1.2 Billion or 34% growth. This is the 
highest performance ever registered in the 
history of our Bank. 
Following the Shareholders’ decision at the 
16th Extra-ordinary Meeting to raise the paid-up 
capital of the Bank from Birr 6 Billion to Birr 12 
Billion in three years’ time, the paid-up capital 
has now reached Birr 8.19 Billion from Birr 
5.85 Billion of last year same period; that is, 
an increment of Birr 2.34 Billion or an increase 
by 40%. Reflecting the surge in paid-up capital, 
earning per share (EPS) has modestly declined 
to 470 in FY 2020/21 from 510 in FY2019/20 
for a par value of Birr 1,000 which, I believe, 
is still very lucrative and encouraging to the 
shareholders.
As a result of enhanced operation, inflationary 
situation for goods and services, opening of 
100 new branches and unexpected costs in 
connection with the prevention of the spread 
of coronavirus (COVID-19), total expense of the 
Bank has gone up from Birr 6.61 Billion in 2020 
to Birr 8.92 Billion in 2021. Of the total expense 
items, personnel expense, interest expense, 
and other operating expenses took the highest 
share in their order.
Total deposit as at June 30, 2021 stood at Birr 
108.1 Billion and that was the highest deposit 
balance ever registered in our Bank as well 
as in the history of private banks. The deposit 
balance grew by Birr 33.81 Billion or an increase 
by 46% in 2021.
Total asset drastically grew from Birr 89.30 
Billion in 2020 to Birr 128.70 Billion in 2021; i.e., 
a growth of Birr 39.40 Billion or 44%, and that 
is the highest figure registered by all standards. 
Loans and advances took the biggest share 
of the total asset accounting 67% of the total 
asset of the Bank. NBE bills accounted for Birr 
9.92 Billion or 7.7% of the total asset, but this is 
being redeemed at maturity, which will enhance 
the liquidity position of the Bank.
Nurturing Like the River
Annual Report 2020/21
16
The NPLs ratio as at June 30, 2021 stood at 1.9% 
and this was by far lower than the threshold; i.e. 
5%, set by the NBE. The NPLs ratio in comparison 
with the total loan portfolio is not as such big 
but all possible effort will be exerted to maintain 
it at the lowest possible limit.
The total number of branches of the Bank as at 
end of June 2021 reached 566.
In general, the financial year 2020/21 was 
blossoming in many aspects and the major 
success stories were the following:
1.	 For the fifth time, our Bank has successfully 
achieved all the targets set in the Grand 
Strategy. Hence, our journey framed five 
years ago to “Become One of the Top Ten 
East African Commercial Banks by the 
Year 2025”  is expected to be attainable,
2.	 The Core Banking Upgrading project has 
gone live as of March 1, 2021. At this juncture, 
I would like to extend my gratitude to all IT 
teams and support staff for the work well 
done and that their commitment in making 
it a successful project is praiseworthy,
3.	 The Revised Organizational Structure of 
the Bank has been deliberated, approved 
and implemented since the second half of 
the year,
4.	 The Performance Management System 
(PMS), which is internally developed for the 
planning, rewarding, capacity development 
and staff motivation, has been successfully 
implemented in the financial year. As a 
result, the rewards conferred to all staff
 
members at the end of the year was based 
solely on their performance evaluation 
results, 
5.	 The deposit balance of our Bank exceeded 
Br. 100 Billion mark as on June 17, 2021. 
This was the first of its kind in the private 
banking industry, and
6.	 The newly established regional offices 
named Wolayita Sodo Region and Dessie 
Region have become operational during 
the year.
Despite the above success stories, however, the 
year ahead is expected to be challenging. Banks 
are especially expected to be challenged with 
the following objective realities:
i.	 The situation of peace and stability in 
some parts of the country and the war in 
the Northern Region,
ii.	 The prevalence of the new version 
COVID-19 pandemic and its serious impact 
on doing business,
iii.	 The stiff competition among existing and 
new banks for deposit, both local and 
foreign, and the 30% foreign currency 
surrender requirement, 
iv.	 Country-level double-digit inflation rate for 
food and non-food items, which is expected 
to escalate the expenses of the Bank etc…
I’m, however, very optimistic and of the opinion 
that things will get better as time passes by and 
Awash will keep on doing even better to satisfy 
the interests of its stakeholders.
Taking this opportune moment, I would like 
to extend my sincere appreciation once again 
to our valued customers for their loyalty, and 
committed Management and strong staff
 
members for the remarkable performance 
registered in 2020/21.
At the end, I would also like to thank all 
Shareholders, 
Board 
of 
Directors, 
our 
Correspondent Banks, Federal and Regional 
Government Offices and especially the National 
Bank of Ethiopia and Financial Intelligence 
Center for their relentless support, advice and 
guidance in our day-to-day activities. Thank you 
all!
 
May God bless us and our country!

 REPORT OF THE BOARD 
OF DIRECTORS
Awash Bank’s Board of Directors is pleased 
to present the Annual Report and the Audited 
Financial Statements of the Bank for the financial 
year ended June 30, 2021 to the 26th Annual 
General Meeting of its respected Shareholders. 
Awash Bank continues to deliver superior 
operational and financial performances among 
private banks operating in Ethiopia, further 
cementing its leading position in key performance 
areas such as total deposits, loans and advances, 
total assets, capital base and profit.
The recovery of global economy from the 
negative impacts of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, 
conducive policy environment pursued by the 
Ethiopian Government and the executions of 
innovative and tailor-made strategy by the 
Bank has greatly helped for the impressive 
performances recorded by  Awash Bank during 
FY 2020/21. On the other hand, double digit 
inflation for food and non-food items, foreign 
currency shortage as witnessed by widening 
of the gap between the parallel and the official 
exchange rates and prevalence of internal 
conflicts in some parts of the country were the 
major macro-economic challenges observed in 
FY 2020/21.
During financial year 2020/21, the National Bank 
of Ethiopia has taken various reform measures 
that have directly or indirectly boosted the 
operational and financial performances of banks. 
These include, among others, introduction of 
cash withdrawal limit for individual persons 
and companies, redemption of the legal tender 
currency Birr notes of 10, 50, and 100 and 
introduction of new Birr 200 denomination; and 
continuation of the waiver of the obligatory NBE 
bills purchase.
1. OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCES
Awash 
Bank 
registered 
commendable 
operational results during the period under 
review, indicating on-track move of the Bank 
towards attaining its aspiration of becoming 
“One of the Top Ten Private Banks in East Africa 
by 2025”.
1.1.  DEPOSITS MOBILIZATION
Total deposits of the Bank, including L/C margin 
and deposits from Interest Free Banking (IFB), 
grew by Birr 33.8 billion (45.5 percent) and 
reached Birr 108.1 billion at the end of June,2021. 
Awash Bank is, of course, not only the first but 
also the only Ethiopian private bank to surpass 
the Birr 100 billion mark in total deposits at the 
end of the reporting period. This historic and 
commendable achievement of the Bank was 
mainly attributable to aggressive expansion 
of the customer base of the Bank, offering of 
different deposit products to different customer 
segments, and expansion of different digital and 
conventional service delivery channels, including 
full-fledged IFB branches. 
During FY 2020/21 alone, about two million new 
customers have opened deposit accounts with 
Awash Bank. In addition, both mobile and internet 
banking services subscribers have reached 
over two million at the end of the report period. 
Moreover, deposit  mobilized from Interest 
Free Banking line of business has witnessed 
encouraging performance and reached Birr 7.49 
billion as at June 30, 2021; registering a net 
increment of Birr 3.54 billion (89.5 percent) over

1.3.  INTERNATIONAL BANKING      	
  SERVICES
The overarching objectives of the Bank with 
regard to International Banking Services are 
facilitating the flow of goods and services across 
the globe and generation of foreign currency 
from different sources through maintaining 
good relationship with correspondent banks, 
international money transfer and payment 
operators, NGOs and recipients of remittances.
During the period under review, Awash Bank 
has devised a new lottery-based scheme 
called“ ይቆጥቡ፣ይቀበሉ፣ይሸለሙ” meaning 
“Save, Receive and Win” that will motivate 
both savers and recipients of remittances to 
conduct transactions through Awash Bank 
and win the lottery prizes. Moreover, Awash 
Bank has strengthened its relationship with 
correspondent banks to the extent of getting 
the Bank labeled as the most reliable and 
dependable private bank in Ethiopia.
Reflecting the effort of the Bank, the foreign 
currency generated during the period under 
review grew by USD 32.4 million over the same 
period of last year and reached USD 901.8 
million at the end of June, 2021. This result 
was commendable, given the existence of stiff
 
competition among local banks, widening of 
foreign exchange premium in the parallel market 
and slowdown of foreign exchange inflows due 
to, among others, COVID 19 pandemic.
1.4.  TOTAL ASSETS
As at June 30,2021, total asset of the Bank 
reached Birr 128.7 billion, depicting a growth 
of Birr 39.4 billion (44.1 Percent) over the 
corresponding period of last year.  Of the 
total asset, net loans and advances took the 
lion’s share of Birr 86 billion (67 percent).  The 
significant growth in the asset size of the Bank 
was largely attributed to the increase in loans 
and advances to customers and investment on 
fixed assets, which would ensure a sustainable 
growth of the Bank in the long run.
The continuous surge in the asset position of 
the Bank over the last two decades reveals that 
Awash Bank’s growth is organic, in the right way 
and within the risk appetite of the Bank.

2.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Awash Bank has registered an impressive 
financial result during FY 2020/21 despite 
the difficult business environment due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic and internal conflicts.
2.1. INCOME
 Awash Bank generated a total income of Birr 
13.7 billion during financial year 2020/21, up 
by Birr 3.5 billion (34.6 percent) as compared 
with the same period of last year, driven by 
a remarkable increase in all components of 
income. Interest income rose by 25.9 percent 
and stood at Birr 9.9 billion, largely reflecting 
increases in loans and advances. Similarly, 
income from fees and commissions as well as 
other operating incomes grew by 63.4 percent 
and 64.9 percent, respectively, indicating a surge 
in income associated with issuance of letters of 
credit, gains on foreign currency dealings and 
rental income from own buildings.
In terms of composition, interest income 
continued to account for the lion’s share of 
total income (72 percent), followed by fees and 
commission income (19.1 percent) and other 
operating income (8.8 percent).
1.5. CAPITAL 
Awash Bank actively manages its capital to 
meet current and future business needs as well 
as regulatory requirements.  Total equity of the 
Bank increased by Birr 3.9 billion (32.4 percent) 
as compared with the preceding financial year 
and reached Birr 15.9 billion at the end of June, 
2021. 
In line with the decision of the shareholders 
of Awash Bank to raise the paid-up capital to 
Birr 12 billion at the end of June 2023, paid-up 
capital of the Bank grew by Birr 2.3 billion (40 
percent) in one financial year alone and stood at 
Birr 8.2 billion as at June 30, 2021. This massive 
capital injection indicates the confidence of the 
shareholders in the future of their Bank and 
their determination to strategically position the 
Bank to withstand both domestic and foreign 
competitions. Awash Bank is not only the most 
capitalized private bank in Ethiopia but also a 
Bank whose paid-up capital by far exceeds the 
minimum statutory requirement of Birr 5 billion 
set by the NBE, which all existing commercial 
banks operating in Ethiopia are required to meet 
by June 30,2026.

2.2.  EXPENSES
The total expenses of the Bank stood at Birr 8.9 
billion by the end of June 2021, up by Birr 2.3 
billion (35 percent) from last year similar period, 
driven by an increase in personnel expense, 
interest expense and other operating expenses.
 
Personnel expenses increased by Birr 1.3 billion 
and stood at Birr 3.5 billion as at June 30, 
2021, mainly mirroring the staff salary scale 
adjustments at the beginning of the financial 
year 2020/21, the significant branch expansion 
endeavor of the Bank during the last two years 
(opening up of 156 new branches), and the 
implementation of new organizational structure 
Table 4:  Composition of Expense (In Millions of Birr)
during the 2nd half of the year. Similarly, interest 
expenses increased by 25 percent and reached 
Birr 3.3 billion, on account of growth in interest 
bearing savings and time deposits. 
The expense structure of the Bank was 
dominated by personnel expenses, which 
accounted for 39.1 percent of the total expenses, 
followed by interest expenses (37.1 percent) 
and other operating expenses (11.6 percent). The 
remaining 12.3 percent of total expenses was 
accounted by impairment charges on loans and 
other assets and depreciation and amortization 
expenses.

Table 5: Trends in Profit (In Millions of Birr)
2.3. PROFIT 
Awash Bank registered a record high profit of Birr 4.8 billion during financial year 2020/21, which was 
not only a record high in the history of Awash Bank but also in the history of private banks operating 
in Ethiopia. Profit before tax surged by Birr 1.2 billion (34 percent), largely supported by substantial 
increases in both interest and non- interest incomes.
Earnings per share of the Bank modestly declined to Birr 470 in 2020/21 from Birr 510 in 2019/20 for 
a par value of Birr 1,000, solely due to the significant increase in paid-up capital of the Bank by Birr 
2.3 billion.

Over the past years, Awash Bank has demonstrated unprecedented growth in virtually all areas of its 
operations, which, in turn, necessitated a commensurate growth of human resources. Awash Bank’s 
number of staff increased by 2, 058 during the review period, raising its total staff strength to 12, 188 
by the end of June 2021. The new recruits include young university graduates and experienced senior 
staff from other banks.
In line with the capacity development program of the Bank, over Birr 20.5 million was spent for staff 
training and education during FY 2020/21. Indeed, the capacity development plan of the Bank was 
slightly halted during the review period, owing to COVID 19 related meeting and travel protocols.

3.4. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
Awash Bank is committed in setting the pace in the adoption of financial technology. Consequently, 
the Bank has immensely invested in new technologies and digital solutions during the FY 2020/21. 
This is in line with the Bank’s pledge to create value for its esteemed customers through a wide 
range of innovative products and services.
In light of this, Awash Bank has upgraded its Information Technology Systems during the FY 
2020/21, which enabled ease of integration with bill payments, e-commerce and other instant online 
payments. Core Banking System, Digital Footprints, Digital Channel Platform and Enterprise Service 
Bus were among the systems that are upgraded during the FY 2020/21. In effect, Awash Bank was 
able to attract new customers and serve its existing customers by availing various services on the 
Mobile App and by availing other alternative delivery channels. 
During the reported financial year, Awash Bank integrated its system with different players in the 
payment ecosystem and facilitated its customers’ payment services and enhanced their satisfaction 
by creating positive customer experience. Accordingly, the Bank integrated its systems with Ministry 
of Revenues (Derash Platform), Ethio-telecom (telebirr), DSTv, CANAL+, Schools (Fee Payments) and 
Traffic Police (Penalty Payment). 
In a bid to facilitate payments to billers and third parties, Awash Bank has also implemented QR 
code during the financial year. This Scan-and-Pay service enables payment by scanning the Quick 
Response (QR) Code to be generated by the merchants and other billers.  Similarly, Awash Bank has 
enabled an interoperability functionality with Rays MFI (Sahay), making customer of one company 
to transact on the channels of the other company as well. During the fiscal year 2020/21, the Bank 
has also integrated with Paypal that enables payment to be directly received in the Awash Wallet 
Account. 
3.5.	CONSTRUCTION OF OWN BUILDINGS
The construction of Bulbula building (2B+G+ 13) that was started last year was 30% completed, while 
structural work of Bale Robe building(B+G+4) was almost completed and left only  with finishing 
works. On the other hand, during FY 2020/21, the Bank has secured land for the construction of 
buildings in Asella and Dire-Dawa towns.
In a bid to have convenient branch offices and reduce the ever-growing office rental expenses, the 
Bank has bought three adjacent condominium commercial houses in Addis Ababa around Bole 
Bulbula area to be merged and used for branch office.

Awash Bank’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives are hinged on the belief that today’s 
business performance is measured by not only the financial numbers but also by the social investment 
as well as contributions made towards economic developments of the country.

projects and charity organizations across the country. The recipients of the contribution were Deborah 
Foundation, SNV Netherlands Development Organization, Care Ethiopia, Centro Aiuti per I’Ethiopia

4. Interest Free Banking (IFB) Sharia Advisory Committee’s Report for 
Financial Year 2020/21
Sharia Advisory Committee
“In the name of Allah, the most Compassionate, the most Merciful”
To the Bank’s Board of Directors, all stakeholders and depositors:
In 
compliance 
with 
the 
duties 
and 
responsibilities vested on us in the Bank’s 
Shariah Advisory Committee Charter and 
the letter of appointment thereafter, we are 
required to ensure that Awash Bank’s IFB 
operations are in compliance with the Islamic 
Shariah principles as well as those required 
by NBE Directive No. SBB/72/2019, Article 2, 
Sub-article 2.2, in this regard. 
It has been our regular duties and responsibilities 
to conduct periodic review of products and 
services to assure that IFB operational activities 
and transactions within the Bank and its IFB 
policies and procedures issued henceforth 
are in compliance with Shariah principles and 
requirements.
To this end, we are required to issue and 
submit this report, which complies with the 
international best practices, to be published on 
the Bank’s annual financial report. 
Accordingly, Awash Bank is offering the following 
IFB services in fund mobilization, fund utilization 
and service-based products at its more than 
566 branches, among which 27 (Twenty-Seven) 
are full-fledged IFB Branches, designated as 
“IKHLAS”, which is brand name for the bank’s 
IFB products.
All of the IFB products are reviewed and certified 
by us as being Shariah-compliant.
•	 Wadi’ah saving, Student-Plus (Wadi’ah for 
education), Al-Khair & Labbaik – Wadi’ah 
saving accounts;
•	 Wadi’ah current account (Amanah);  
•	 Unrestricted 
Mudarabah 
Investment 
accounts;
•	 Murabaha Financing schemes (Cost + Mark-
up); 
•	 Interest-Free Export Financing scheme 
(Qard) = Free Loans;
•	 Loan for Overseas Employment Agencies

(Qard) = Free Loans; 
•	 Loan for the poor (Qard-ul Hassan) = Free 
Loans; 
•	 IFB Trade Services, (Murabaha, Musharakah 
and Wakalah L/C);
•	 IFB Bank Guarantees (Kafalah);
•	 Hawalah (Hiwalah), etc.
We have reviewed the products listed above with 
their respective expected Shariah principles, 
the relevant contracts, transactions and IFB 
core banking introduced by Awash Bank during 
the year ended 30 June 2021. In addition, we 
have assessed the IFB policies and procedures 
adopted 
by 
the 
Bank, 
examined 
sample 
transactions, 
the 
relevant 
documentations, 
all information and explanations which we 
considered necessary and sufficiently provide 
us evidence to give reasonable assurance that 
Awash Bank operations have not violated the 
Shariah principles. 
In our opinion, generally, we, the Shariah Advisory 
Committee of Awash Bank, do hereby confirm 
that: 
1.	 The 
IFB 
Products 
mentioned 
above, 
operational 
procedures, 
contracts, 
transactions and dealings entered into by the 
Bank during the year ended 30 June 2021 that 
we have reviewed are in compliance with the 
Shariah principles and the Shariah rulings 
related to IFB operations. 
2.	 Mudarabah deposits and financing (Profit-
Loss Sharing) is not yet started and thus, 
there is no allocation of profit and charging of 
losses relating to investment accounts; 
3.	 The profits generated by the Bank, from 
Murabaha and other services like Kafalah, 
are Shariah-compliant and there are no 
earnings that have been realized from 
sources prohibited by the Shariah principles 
and thus, no fund is expected to be disposed 
to charitable causes from the Bank itself. 
However, Birr 3,146,216.79 collected from 
defaulted customers in the form of penalty 
must be given to Charity.
4.	 Since Awash Bank’s shareholders include 
Non-Muslims, it is not required to pay zakat 
during the financial year ended 30 June 2021.
Thank You (Jazakumullah Khairan)!
