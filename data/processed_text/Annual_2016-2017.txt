HONORABLE SHAREHOLDERS! 
On behalf of the Board of Directors of the Bank of 
Abyssinia S.C and myself, I am highly honored to 
present the Board of Directors’ Report along with the 
“Audited Financial Statements” of the Bank to the 21st 
Ordinary Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders 
of the Bank for the Fiscal Year 2016/17 that ended on 
June 30, 2017. 
As we know, the world economy has undergone 
unprecedented changes during the just-ended Fiscal 
Year 2016/17. According to World Bank Report on 
Global Economic prospect in June 2017, global growth 
is strengthening. As a result, despite policy uncertainty, 
global growth is projected to rise to 2.7 percent in 2017, 
up from a post-crisis low level of 2.4 percent in 2016.

Activities in advanced economies are also expected to 
gain momentum in 2017 and 2018.Besides, in the Euro 
Zone and Japan, growth forecasts have been improved, 
reflecting strengthening domestic demand and exports.
As to the growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, it is projected 
to recover to 2.6 percent in 2017 from the sharp decline 
to 1.3 percent in 2016, and even to further strengthen 
some what in 2018 due to rising commodity prices and 
improvements to macroeconomic imbalances. 
Despite this global economic scenario, Ethiopia’s economy 
has kept on performing well. According to the National 
Planning Commission of Ethiopia 2015/16 Annual Report, 
the country’s economic growth dwindled to 8 percent 
as compared to that of the previous year’s figure, i.e 10.1 
percent. 
According to the World Bank, the economy is also 
projected to expand by 8.3% in 2017, 8.0% in 2018 and 
7.9% in 2019, largely due to public investments. The 
country somehow is expected to maintain its position 
with the fastest and highest growth rate forecasted for 
any African country, followed by Tanzania and the Ivory 
Coast.
With regard to the demand side, GDP at current market 
price went up by 19.8 percent and reached Birr 1.8 trillion 
in 2016/17. This has brought about an increase in GDP per 
capita from USD 794 in 2015/16 to USD 846 in 2016/17.In 
2015/16, the Gross domestic saving reached 22.4 percent 
and also estimated to be 23.5 percent in 2017.
During the FY 2016/17, the financial sector which 
comprises mainly banking and insurance institutions was 
stable, growing rapidly both in terms of size and number 
of services. The sector has also continued to tap into new 
opportunities of mobilizing savings through expansion of

mobilization, loans and advances and profit growth in the 
year under review.
In this five-year plan, the Bank has devised ambitious, but 
achievable plan using a number of strategic initiatives 
that have been classified under customer services, 
information technology, human capital and internal 
processes in order to become a major force in the market 
and stand out in the forefront in the banking industry 
and regain its once-admired status. As I have cited above, 
we are now at the second implementation year of the 
journey in the strategic plan period and observing our 
efforts are bearing fruit. 
However, it should be understood that these outcomes 
could not be achieved without the encouragement of all 
stakeholders, support of Board of Directors, leadership of 
the Management and unstinted efforts of the whole staff 
of the Bank. 
Finally, on behalf of the Board of Directors and myself, I 
would like to seize this opportunity to express gratitude 
and admiration to the National Bank of Ethiopia for its 
unreserved guidance, our shareholders for many years 
of patience and trust, our esteemed customers for their 
confidence and trust on our Bank. 
My most sincere thanks also go to my fellow members 
of the Board of Directors, Executive Management and 
employees of BoA for their unwavering dedication and 
commitment that has helped us to realize this notable 
accomplishment under all these inconvenient situations.
Thank you all!!

branch networks and introduction of digital channels as 
well as new financial instruments.
Despite a number of challenges in the external 
environment, BoA managed to register a total asset and 
capital level of Birr 25.3 billion and Birr 2.90 billion as at 
June 30, 2017, exhibiting a growth of 50.49 percent and 
36.73 percent, respectively as compared to that of the 
preceding year. Its total deposit balance also reached 
Birr 20.7 billion growing by 51.8 percent over the figure 
registered last year. 
Similarly, during the reviewed period, the total 
outstanding loans and advances of the Bank, before 
provision for doubtful loans and advances, stood at 
Birr 14.1 billion, indicating a 73.7 percent rise over the 
previous year’s balance. In addition, the Bank secured 
a total income of Birr 2.38 billion and incurred a total 
expense of Birr 1.67 billion. As a result, the gross profit 
before tax and after provision became Birr 704.46 million 
surpassing that of the preceding fiscal year by Birr 217.22 
million or 44.58 percent. 
HONORABLE SHAREHOLDERS! 
Bank of Abyssinia has been operating in a rapidly 
changing 
banking 
environment, 
i.e 
changing 
customers’ expectations and behaviours, tightening 
regulatory requirements, stiff competition and varying 
demographic and economic situations, among others. 
These gave rise to the need for BoA to introduce change 
in the overall way of doing business which is capable of 
fully addressing those challenges. 
To this end, the Bank has crafted a five-year strategic 
and organizational transformation plan together with 
the Consultant, Deloitte Consulting Plc. Currently, the 
Bank is in the second five-year strategy plan period with 
impressive outcome registered in the areas of deposit

STATEMENT
OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
DEAR HONORABLE SHAREHOLDERS!
I am honored to present the Performance Report of 
the Bank of Abyssinia S.C for the Fiscal Year that ended 
on June 30, 2017. The fiscal year had been a period in 
which remarkable results were attained in the financial 
and operational areas with tremendous efforts exerted 
towards bringing about efficient customer service and 
growth.
During the jus-ended fiscal year, the country’s 
growth momentum has continued with stable 
macro-economic environment. It was also a period in 
which the second-year implementation time for the 
execution of GTP II has been commenced. In this plan, 
financial institutions are required to have significant 
role towards boosting financial accessibility and 
deposit mobilization. 
I fell honored to declare that in this fiscal year 2016/17, BoA registered 
a record high income and gross profit, which have never been achieved 
in the Bank’s history. 
"
Also in this plan, the Government envisages to scale up 
the number of bank branches to 5,736 and mobilize over 
Birr 1.8 trillion deposit through commercial banks as well 
as microfinance institutions by the end of the GTP II plan 
period. 
Following the direction given by the National Bank of 
Ethiopia to increase their annual branch expansion and 
deposit mobilization, therefore, commercial banks have 
kept on their aggressive branch expansion, introduction 
of technology-based alternative service delivery channels 
and other complementary banking services. As a result, 
banks have significantly expanded their outreach 
making the competition among themselves for resource 
mobilization stiffer. 
Bank of Abyssinia has continued implementing its 4th Five-
Year Strategic Plan and Organizational Transformation 
deliverables, which are developed jointly with the 
international consultant known as Deloitte Consulting 
PLC. This new strategic plan and organizational 
configuration is devised to take full advantage of market 
opportunities and attain better growth year on year 
during the plan period. The Bank has been and shall 
continue implementing strategic and transformational 
initiatives which are geared towards winning the market 
competition and achieve growth objectives. 
As an outcome of the strategic plan, the Bank has 
managed to lift up its branch networks to 233 adding 48 
new branches and sub-branches during the fiscal year 
2016/17. It has also expanded other alternative service 
delivery channels by installing 114 ATMs as well as 
placing 200 POS machines at merchant sites. As a result,

advances of the Bank at the end of the fiscal year 
2016/17 stood at Birr 14.1 billion, surpassing that of 
the preceding fiscal year’s balance by Birr 5.98 billion or 
73.68%. Concerning loan quality, special efforts made 
on loan collection assisted the Bank to bring down the 
level of Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) below 2%. The 
Bank’s total asset and total capital also reached Birr 25.3 
billion and Birr 2.90 billion, respectively. 
Respected shareholders! 
I fell honored to declare that in this fiscal year 2016/17, 
BoA registered a record high income and gross profit, 
which have never been achieved in the Bank’s history. 
That is a total income of Birr 2.38 billion and gross profit 
after provision of Birr 704.46 million exceeding that of 
last year’s figure by 45.62% and 44.58%, respectively. 
Finally, on behalf of the Executive Management, 
dedicated staff of the Bank and myself, I would like 
to extend my earnest admiration to NBE for all its 
guidance and assistance; the Bank’s honored customers, 
shareholders 
and 
others 
stakeholders 
for 
their 
conviction and confidence in our Bank’s strides; and 
all employees for their unreserved effort to materialize 
BoA’s aspirations during the review period. 
As a final note, members of the Board of Directors also 
deserve special gratitude for the commendable effort 
they have exerted towards assisting the Management 
within the scope of their duties and responsibilities.
Thank you,
Mulugeta Asmare

3.3 Business Development 
During the just-ended fiscal year, BoA had kept 
on undertaking wide-ranging marketing activities 
in an enhanced manner. For instance, the newly 
introduced marketing approach has brought about 
marked business growth through identifying 
and targeting most attractive customers and 
determining how to cater services to them based 
on segment-specific needs. Furthermore, the 
marketing wing had been exerting utmost efforts 
to fully put in place the newly implemented 
relationship eco-system which allows BoA to 
manage its relationship with customers. 
During this period, the Bank had continued 
working with eight Money Transfer Companies 
that established business relations with the Bank 
long ago and also made all out efforts in order 
to forge similar new business ties with other 
reputable Money Transfer Companies. In addition, 
the Bank had executed diverse activities to step up 
the functionality of POS terminals, which allows 
users to enjoy additional features and thus boost 
the amount of foreign currency secured through 
acquiring of international cards (MasterCard and 
China Union Pay). Acquiring of Visa international 
card on ATMs has been finalized and is expected 
to commence catering services in July 2017.
Furthermore, following the new relationship 
management eco-system; the Bank has assigned 
dedicated relationship managers with sound 
banking knowledge who extend assistance and 
are responsible for the business growth of retail 
(individual) or business (corporate) customers. 
Account managers who better understand the 
needs and preferences of particular segments of 
customers and are also responsible for the growth 
of retail customers through acquisition and cross-
selling of products also commenced playing their 
new role during the just-ended fiscal year. In 
addition, the Bank opened two luxurious priority 
branches with a view to deliver personalized 
services for corporate customers.  
16 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C.   ANNUAL REPORT
Moreover, 
aggressive 
sales 
campaign 
and 
promotional works had also been carried out; 
making use of various electronics and print media 
through hiring prime times and sponsoring 
different TV and radio programs in a bid to elevate 
the positive image of Bank as well as publicize 
its diverse products and services to the general 
public. 
3.4 Information Systems 
As part of the strategy, the Bank has offered special 
attention to technology adoption and leveraging 
in order to build its competitive advantage and 
step up delivery of products and services to its 
customers. To this end, it has finalized the initial 
stage of upgrading the core banking system with 
latest version during the reporting fiscal year, 
which will enable it to deliver convenient and 
efficient services to its customers.
During the 2016/17FY, though the Bank’s 
penetration rate of digital service failed to grow 
as per the plan; the adoption and usage of card 
banking and mobile banking grew by 127% and 
157%, respectively as compared to last year similar 
period. The number of mobile and card banking 
service users also reached 107,711 and 132,703, 
respectively as at June 30, 2017.
Alongside of branch expansion, the Bank has 
invested in the deployment of electronic channels 
including ATM, POS, Agent Banking and Internet 
Banking. Accordingly, in 2016/17, the expansion 
of ATM and PoS machines grew by 39% and 44%, 
respectively as compared to last year same period 
and following this the total number reached 114 
ATM and 200 PoS machines (off-premise and 
on-premise locations) at the end of June 2017. 
On top of that, delivering banking services to its 
esteemed customers via agent and Internet went 
live this fiscal year. 
4. FUTURE PLAN 
During the reviewed fiscal year, BoA had been 
contributing its part for the macro-economic as 
well as sectoral development like in the previous 
periods. So, it has been allocating its resources to 
sectors that are accorded high national priority, 
delivering banking services via range of channels 
(branches and electronic channels) as well as 
offering tailored products and services based on 
customers’ needs and preferences. 
Furthermore, the Bank will aggressively expand 
its branch networks and thus envisages opening 
additional branches in more bankable areas 
during the FY 2017/18 so as to come closer to 
its customers. In order to cater the leading edge 
products and services via Card Banking, Mobile 
Banking, Internet Banking and Agent Banking 
services; the Bank will also keep on making efforts 
to step up the banking service accessibility. 
Unstinted efforts will also be exerted during this 
period to launch Interest-Free Banking services in 
order to sustain the growth and profitability of the 
Bank. 
In the coming  fiscal year, the Bank will also 
gear up all its efforts towards the successful 
implementation 
of 
all 
prioritized 
strategic 
initiatives and looks for ways of competitive 
edge within the changing business environment. 
These strategic initiatives are also expected to 
bring about a paradigm shift in the Bank’s overall 
business system and operating model, which 
would enable it to realize the desired goals of 
taking competitive advantage in the industry, 
which will maximize shareholders’ value. 
Therefore, the scrupulous implementation of 
those strategic initiatives demand the concerted 
efforts of all stakeholders of the Bank, i.e., the 
Board of Directors, Executive Management and all 
employees in order to materialize the envisioned 
targets and attain the Bank’s aspirations.

5. APPROPRIATION OF RETAINED EARNINGS 
During the Fiscal Year 2016/17, the Bank secured 
a net profit of Birr 401.05 million after the 
appropriate deductions were made from the gross

paid-up shares after deducting the legal reserve 
of Birr 133.68 million and the share of the Board of 
Directors, which is Birr 900,000. 
6. VOTE OF THANKS 
In the end, BoA’s Board of Directors and the 
Executive Management would like to seize 
this opportunity to express their gratitude 
to the highly-valued customers of the Bank, 
shareholders, employees and the regulatory body 
for their unreserved assistance towards helping 
the Bank to attain this outcome.

BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C.   ANNUAL REPORT
AUDITOR'S REPORT
BANK OF ABYSSINIA SHARE COMPANY
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017
1. BACKGROUND
Bank of Abyssinia was formed in Ethiopia in 1996 and is registered as a private share holding company 
in accordance with the provision of the licensing and supervision of Banking Business Proclamation 
No.84/94 and the Commercial Code of Ethiopia 1960.  The Bank has a network of 244 branches 
throughout the country.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Bank, which are consistent with those applied in the 
preceding year, are stated below:-
a.	 Basis of Preparation
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention, generally 
accepted accounting principles and the laws and regulations of Ethiopia
b.	 Financial Instruments
i. Classification
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset for the Bank and a financial 
liability or equity instrument of another party.  All assets and liabilities in the balance sheet are 
financial instruments except fixed assets, deferred charges and shareholders’ equity.
The major financial instruments of the Bank are loans and advances provided by the Bank to debtors. 
Loans and advances comprise deposits and other balances due from banks and loans and advances 
to customers.
ii Recognition of Financial Instruments
The Bank initially recognizes financial assets and liabilities on its balance sheet on the date it 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.  Any gains and losses arising from 
changes in value of the assets are recognized from this date.  When the Bank becomes a party to the 
contractual terms comprising a loan and as a consequence has the legal right to receive principal 
and interest payments on the loan, it controls the economic benefits associated with the loan. 
 
Normally, a bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions that comprise a loan (i.e. acquires 
legal ownership of the loan) on the date of the advance of funds or payment to the third party.  As a 
result, a commitment to lend fund is not recognized as an asset on the balance sheet.
iii	
De-recognizing of Financial Instruments
All financial assets are de-recognized when the Bank loses control over the contractual rights that 
comprise the assets.  This occurs when the rights are realized, expired or are surrendered.  A financial 
liability is de-recognized when it is extinguished.
iv	
Measurement of Financial Instruments
The Bank measures all financial instruments initially at cost including transaction costs.
25
AUDITOR'S REPORT
c.	 Loans and Advances
Loans and advances are financial instruments originated by the bank by providing money to the 
debtors.  The loans and advances are stated at cost less impairment losses.  Impairment losses comprise 
specific provisions against debts identified as bad and doubtful and general provisions against losses 
which are likely to be present in any loans and advances portfolio.  The Bank follows the National Bank of 
Ethiopia, Supervision of Banking Business Directive SBB43/2008 in determining the extent of provisions 
for impairment losses.  The Directive classifies loans and advances into the following;
i Pass Loans
Loans and advances in this category are fully protected by the current financial and paying capacity 
of the borrower and are not subject to criticism.  In general, loans and advances, which are fully 
secured, both as to principal and interest, by cash or cash substitutes, are classified under this 
category regardless of past due  status or other adverse credit factors.
ii Special Mention
Any loan or advance past due 30 days or more but less than 90 days is classified under this category.
iii Substandard
Non-performing loans or advances past due 90 days or more but less than 180 days is classified 
under this category.
iv Doubtful
Non-performing loans or advances past due 180 days or more but less than 360 days is classified as 
doubtful.
v Losses
Non-performing loans or advances past due 360 days is classified as loss. 
As per the Directive, the provision for impairment losses is determined using the following minimum 
provision percentages against the outstanding principal amount of each loan and advances. 
No.
Loan Category
Extent of provision required

BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C.   ANNUAL REPORT
AUDITOR'S REPORT
30. RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Bank has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments. Asset and liability 
management committee is responsible for implementing appropriate policy, procedure, risk 
management techniques and managing all types of risks in the bank.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the financial exposure resulting from a bank’s dependence on another party to discharge 
an obligation as agreed and cause the bank to incur a financial loss. The bank has established a credit 
risk management system on the basis of maximizing return on its assets while keeping its credit 
exposure within acceptable limits. The Bank regularly reviews its credit portfolio quality, provisioning 
requirements and customer exposure. The bank’s loans and advances are diversified in various sectors 
as shown in Note 5 to the financial statements.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk arises in the general funding activities of the Bank and the management of positions. 
It includes the risk of being unable to fund assets at appropriate maturities and rates and the risk of 
being unable to liquidate an asset at a reasonable price and in appropriate time frame.  The Bank has 
a reasonable funding base.  Funds are raised mainly from customers’ deposits.  The maturity profile is 
monitored by the oversight asset and liability management committee to ensure adequate liquidity is 
maintained.  
Foreign Exchange Risk
Foreign exchange risk results from changes in exchange rates between a bank’s domestic currency and 
other currencies. Foreign exchange risks are controlled by maintaining balances in major currencies 
whose exchange rates against the reporting currency have always been appreciating.  The bank 
settles foreign exchange transactions of customers at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the 
transactions.  Hence, the customers bear the cost of any increase in the exchange rates.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is a risk resulting from changes in interest rates. It is the probability that the rising and 
falling of interest rates will adversely affect the Bank’s interest margin or the value of its net worth.  The 
bank often revises its lending rate across segments of the credit portfolio based on changes in the 
cost of funds, reserve requirements and the perceived risk in each credit portfolio segment to keep the 
overall profitability. 
The assets and liability management committee is responsible for managing rate-sensitive assets and 
liabilities and the effects of rate, volume and mix changes in order to preserve and optimize the interest 
return.
Operational Risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal process and systems, 
fraud, malpractices or external events.  The bank manages its operational risk through implementation 
of sound policies, procedures and staff training on proper implementation of operational manuals by 
the operational units.  Additionally the bank has strong oversight and supervision and internal control 
function.  Besides, IT system and management audit have been started to strengthen operational risk 
management framework.
31. COMPARATIVE FIGURES
Comparative figures have been reclassified to facilitate comparisons.
