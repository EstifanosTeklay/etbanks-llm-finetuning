BOARD CHAIRMAN’S
 MESSAGE
Ambassador Dr.Dibaba Abdeta 
Chairman
Ladies and Gentlemen!! 
T
his is a moment of great felicity for me in 
warmly welcoming you all, on behalf the Board 
of Directors and on my own behalf to the 27th 
Awash Bank’s Shareholders’ Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) of the FY 2021/22. I would also like to convey 
my sincere gratitude to our respected clientele for the 
esteemed cooperation, continued trust and support 
extended to enable Awash Bank to score yet another 
astonishing result in all of the banking operation 
parameters during the FY 2021/22. The devotion and 
the hardworking commitment of the Management and 
the entire employees of the Bank is also incomparable 
and extraordinary that deserves honorary recognition. 
I am also confident that this multidimensional support 
from all stakeholders will also continue to make the 
Bank remain the pioneer leading private bank in the 
country as well as realizing of its future ambition of 
achievement.   
Awash Bank is committed to maintaining & upholding 
good corporate governance in order to protect 
the interests of shareholders, customers and the 
employees. The Bank is governed by twelve Board of 
Directors elected by the General Assembly and the 
Management team comprising of the Chief Executive 
Officer(CEO), Chief & Deputy Chief Officers, Directors 
and Deputy Directors. With these compositions, 
Awash Bank showed a continued progress in building a 
stronger and safer Bank that is capable of delivering 
higher returns to its shareholders.  Particularly, over 
the past ten years, the Bank has recorded an amazing 
result that shown an augmented income and earning 
per share, with a track record of creating a significant 
value for its owners.   
The FY 2021/22 was characterized by significant socio-
economic and geopolitical challenges particularly 
to the banking industry with stagnant global trade, 
disrupted lively hoods, subdued investments and 
uncertainties. The major challenges of the year at 
global level were the negative impacts of the Russia-
Ukraine war and the consequent high inflation. The 
war has also caused major supply disruptions which 
led to higher prices for a number of commodities. It 
also affected global economic prospects and according 
to the World Bank Report of June 2022, the global 
growth is projected to slow down from 5.7 percent in 
2021 to 2.9 percent in 2022 and average of 3 percent 
11
Nurturing Like the River
Annual  Report  2021/22
in 2023/24.  When coming to the domestic economy, 
the political instability in some parts of the country, 
the effect of COVID 19, drought, inflation, a sharp fall 
in donor financing, foreign exchange shortages and 
stiff competitions among the banks were the major 
challenges. Despite of these considerable hurdles, 
however, the year was an exciting year enabling the 
Bank to operate efficiently and once again record a 
commendable result which is unique of its kind.
The major and key financial and non-financial 
highlights for the year ended June 30, 2022 can be 
summed up as under:
●	 The aggregate deposit increased by 41percent 
from last year same period and reached Birr 152 
billion including L/C margin and deposit from IFB,
●	 Loans and Advances surged up by 47.6 percent as 
compared to last year same period and reached 
Birr 129.2 billion,
●	 Total income of the Bank escalated by 50.2 percent 
from last year same period and arrived at Birr 20.6 
billion,
●	 The total expense of the Bank stood at Birr 13.2 
billion as at June 30, 2022, up by 47.9 percent 
from previous year similar period,   
●	 The profit grew by 54.5 percent over previous year 
and reached Birr 7.45 billion, as at ended June 
2022,
●	 Total Foreign Currency generated during the year 
crossed one Billion and stood at USD 1.25 billion 
surpassing the amount generated last year same 
period by USD 343.5 million or 38 percent, 
●	 The aggregate deposit customer base rose to 7.8 
million,
●	 The branch network as at June 30, 2022 has 
reached 725.     
The increments registered in the major performances 
is exceptional in the history of the private banks 
and the history of Awash Bank itself, reflecting the 
underlying strengths of the AB’s business. 
The other major contributory factors for the growth 
are the efforts exerted in the resource mobilization 
activities and the continuous hard work applied in the 
collection of loans and advances, as a result of which 
the status of the Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) has 
shown a significant reduction to less than 1.5 percent 
as at the end of June 30, 2022.
In general, the overall success of the Bank is coiled 
on the wise guidance of the Board of Directors, the 
prudent and coordinated quality leadership of the CEO, 
the Management Members as well as the unreserved 
dedication of the entire employees and the overall 
strong efforts made by the Bank-wide community to 
maximize the wallet share of the Bank. 
Though the year was turbulent and daunting, it is 
worth mentioning to raise one miraculous victory 
which the Bank enjoyed during the year under review. 
This amazing event was that a well-known world-wide 
Finance Magazine named ‘’Global Finance Magazine’’ 
has chosen Awash Bank, as one of the World’s Best 
Bank in the year 2022.  In connection with this 
particular selection, the Bank was recognized during 
the IMF/World Bank Annual Meeting which was held in 
Washington DC on October 15,2022.  This has changed 
the history of Awash Bank and repositioned it to 
another higher growth level of the world standard.       
At this point, it should be noted the Board is always 
committed to ensuring that Awash Bank is a resilient 
organization with a focus on long-term value creation. 
The fast-track actions taken by the Board during the 
year, for fundamental changes & ensuring sustainable 
& profitable growth through excellence in operation, 
technology & ultimately customer experience have all 
contributed to the success of the Bank.  
Awash Bank is engaged in many different project 
activities, such as Corporate Strategy Development 
by a well-known international consultant, McKinsey & 
Co., IT Projects and the construction of own building 
projects at different parts of the country.
To make the future IT Platform more user-friendly 
for the clients and also to go abreast along with the 
unprecedented surge in the digitalization of financial 
services, the Bank has planned to review the current 
technology system and replace some of them with 
modern and standardized technology. 
Concerning the Human Capital Management, the 
Board believes that having an engaged & motivated 
workforce & a sound governance & risk management 
are pivotal to attain the sustainable growth and 
the vision that the Bank aspires for. In this regard, 
the Bank is crafting a strategy that enables attract, 
motivate and retain qualified and skilled manpower. 
Concurrent with this, steps were taken to improve 
staff productivity, focusing on optimizing the existing 
resource through internal job postings, transfers and 
skill development/capacity building initiatives.
In connection with the capital structure, the payment 
of the Birr 12 billion paid up capital of the Bank would 
be completed before June 2023. The strategic growth 
aspiration of the Bank, which is to become one of 
the top ten African Banks by the year 2030 have to 
be backed by a solid capital base. On top of that, 
the capital adequacy ratio of the Bank also should 
comfortably be above the regulatory requirement 
and should provide strong foundation for the 
company. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that 
the growth of the Bank itself entails capital growth. 
 
12
Nurturing Like the River
Annual  Report  2021/22
Therefore, in consideration of the above points, the 
Board solicits the Shareholders to approve a new paid 
up capital proposed by the Board as included in the 
extra-ordinary agenda items to maintain the Bank 
with a strong capital position for the coming years.    
Moreover, the Board and the Management are still 
courageous to work hard during the FY 2022/23, in 
spite of the entry of foreign banks and consequent 
fierce competition amongst Banks, the persistence 
of the impacts of living costs and political instability 
globally and domestically. Given the dedication of the 
Board, the commitment of the Management Team, the 
competency of the entire employees and the results 
registered to date, the attainment of the new vision 
of becoming One of the Top Ten African Banks by 2030 
is inevitable. The Bank will continue to deliver on its 
strategic commitments, which drive the operational 
performances and create value for the shareholders 
as well as the communities at large.  
On top of its corporate objectives, the contribution 
of the Bank to the growth of the national economy of 
the country and the wellbeing of its citizens during 
the year under review is eye-catching as observed 
from the annual tax paid, the financial contributions 
made for the national development projects as well 
as the various financial supports given to the disaster 
victims.  During the year under review, Awash Bank 
has provided financial support to the displaced and 
drought stricken people of Oromia and Somali Regional 
States. It also supported the flood victims in the 
Amhara Regional State, during the reporting period.
In conclusion, on behalf of the Board of Directors, I 
would like to express my honest appreciations to all 
shareholders, loyal customers and the public at large 
for their unwavering and indispensable support and 
the confidence they have on our Bank. I look forward 
to their continuous and renewed commitment to work 
with the Bank in the future to come. 
My special thanks goes to the Management Members 
and the entire employees for their passion and 
commitment, belongingness and hard work to upswing 
their Bank, in delivering commendable results and 
enabling the Bank to maintain its leading position 
among the private commercial banks in the country. 
I would also like to commend the National Bank of 
Ethiopia (NBE) for providing our Bank a constructive 
guidance and enthusiastic support. 
Finally, recalling that the Bank has come a long 
way so far, and has still a long way to go, I want 
to assure you that in the years to come, our Bank 
will strongly scrutinize the laid down new vision 
and strategy to bring about further excellence by 
exploiting opportunities and vigilantly withstanding 
the challenging environment.  
Thank You!

Annual  Report  2021/22
O
n behalf of the entire Management of 
Awash Bank and on my own behalf, I would 
like to sincerely congratulate all respected 
Shareholders, Board of Directors, hard-working 
and committed Management and staff members 
and above all, most loyal and valued customers 
of the Bank on an unprecedented operational 
and non-operational performance your Bank has 
registered for the financial year ended June 30, 
2022. All other stakeholders of the Bank would 
also deserve due recognition and appreciation for 
their relentless support rendered to us to enable 
us achieve this extra-ordinary performance in the 
history of our Bank as well as in the industry of 
private banks of the country.
The financial year just ended was challenging. 
COVID-19, which was declared as a global 
pandemic, has still been a concerning health 
problem world-wide. As a result, movement to 
and from countries has not been as wide-open 
as it used to be. The war between Russia and 
Ukraine has seriously affected the economic and 
political situations of the world and its impact is 
still being felt by many countries.   
Domestically, the war in the northern part of 
our country is utterly affecting the national 
economy in general and the banking business in 
particular. The instability in the western part and 
subsequent intermittent closure of branch offices 
has negatively affected our day-to-day operations 
and undesirably restricted our endeavor in 
reaching the unbanked and under-banked parts 
of the society.
Apart from the above, the following were some 
of the most visible hurdles that we were exposed 
to during the financial year:
1.	
During the year, month-to-month inflation rate 
peaks at above 30%, showing an increase from 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE  OFFICER’S  
STATEMENT
Tsehay Shiferaw
Chief Executive Officer
22
Nurturing Like the River
Annual  Report  2021/22
similar periods of last year. Both food and non-
food parts of the index showed an upward 
momentum and sometimes, it has reached 
to the level of 42.9% compared to the same 
period of last year. As it goes without saying, 
this inflationary situation nation-wide has 
similarly escalated the various expenses of the 
Bank.
2.	
In January 2022, the central bank slashed 
foreign currency retention rates by half 
to 20%. Thus, foreign account holders can 
only retain 20% of their transfers in foreign 
currencies, and they shall surrender only 10% 
to the commercial banks. More significantly, 
the surrender requirement has been changed 
from 50% to 70%. Thus, the majority (70%) 
forex earnings from exports, remittances, and 
transfers to non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) were being surrendered to the central 
bank. This has significantly eroded the foreign 
currency position of the Bank and we faced 
challenges to address the high demand of our 
importers satisfactorily. 
3.	
In line with the letter of the Ministry of Finance, 
public institutions were instructed to close 
their accounts at private banks and transfer 
their resources to the coffer at public bank, 
which has been assigned by the central bank to 
manage public money on its behalf. Apparently, 
this will affect the deposit balance of private 
banks in the short and long term and will make 
doing business with public institutions in the 
future uncertain.
	 The impact of the above and other factors on 
our business was substantial. However, our Bank 
has been and is still putting in place different 
strategies to withstand the circumstances and 
be able to sustain our businesses. 
	 The above being the facts on the ground, 
however, the following prospects were also 
available during the year and our Bank was 
able to make use of the opportunities to the 
fullest extent possible.
1.	
Nation-wide, the export of goods over the 
2021/22 financial year brought in USD 4.12 
Billion, nearly 14% higher than the revenue 
generated last year. Agricultural commodities 
accounted for close to three-quarters of the 
revenue. Coffee remained the most valuable 
export item, generating USD 1.4 Billion by 
exporting close to 300,000 tons. As a result, 
the foreign currency generated by our Bank 
through different sources, which was USD 1.25 
Billion, was by far higher than last year same 
period of USD 902 Million. 
2.	
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been 
signed with various organizations during the 
year. These organizations have been channeling 
a good sum of local and hard currencies 
through our Bank and that has enabled us to 
address the demands of our customers as much 
as possible.
3.	
As a result of the strength of our Bank in terms 
of its total asset, capital, branch network and 
other financial parameters, local prominent 
giant organizations have chosen Awash Bank as 
their business partner. As a result, substantial 
amount of local deposits has been mobilized 
during the year. Our business relationships 
with these strategic partners will be reinforced 
with greater vigor and enthusiasm in the times 
to come.
4.	
Customers’ Week of the Bank was colorfully 
celebrated and successfully concluded in 
March 2022. The celebration of the program 
has enabled us to renew our commitment to 
serving our customers diligently and taking a 
lesson from the program, it has been resolved 
to conduct such type of program bank-wide 
every year.
5.	
For the first time in the industry, our Bank has 
introduced an innovative payment solution 
known 
as 
Awash 
E-School 
Management 
System 
to 
various local schools, colleges and universities 
free of charge. The solution will basically 
provide parents and students a wide-range 
of payment options, ensuring the payment of 
the fees timely, efficiently and conveniently. 
This will definitely avoid the burden of manual 
collection and the risks associated with it and 
help the Bank in its resource mobilization 
endeavor.
6.	
In an effort to expand business relationship 
and thereby enhance the foreign exchange 
stock of the Bank, our Bank has officially 
started relationship with Swiss Remit, Thunes 
and Remitly remittance companies during the 
year.
23
Nurturing Like the River
Annual  Report  2021/22
7.	
As a result of an impressive growth of our 
Bank in deposits, loans and advances, assets, 
profit, capital, branch network, customer 
base expansion, product innovation and digital 
banking expansion efforts over the last ten 
years, the Global Finance Magazine has 
named our Bank as the Best Bank of Ethiopia 
for the Year 2022 in its May 2022 Edition of the 
Best Bank Awards. This will definitely enhance 
the reputation of our Bank world-wide.
8.	
Our Bank has become a member of Small and 
Medium Enterprises (SME) Financing Forum. 
The Forum has 240 member banks and fintech 
companies. The Forum will enable to promote 
members’ best practices, transfer knowledge 
among members and to foster cooperation. 
No doubt, being a member of the Forum will 
enhance the reputation of our Bank in the 
times to come.
9.	
In May 2022, an Entrepreneurship Competition 
coined under the name Tatariwochu was 
launched 
with 
a 
primary 
objective 
of 
empowering the visionaries. The project will 
provide training, business development support 
and access to finance for entrepreneurs with 
innovative and problem-solving business ideas 
and it is expected to play its role in nation-
building activities and last, but not least,
10.Our Bank has signed loan agreement with 
 
Nine 
Private 
Micro-Finance 
Institutions 
(MFIs) to bridge reaching out to the under-
served segment of the market through these 
institutions. The Bank has made Br. 5.5 Billion 
available in credit for small enterprises and 
farmers to be disbursed through these MFIs 
in the coming three years. This will somehow 
address the access to finance of the under-
financed groups of the society and at the same 
time bring in the money in circulation to the 
banking system.
Exploiting 
the 
available 
opportunities 
and 
learning 
from drawbacks, our Bank, with a coordinated 
effort of all, has performed remarkably well 
in all parameters during the year. Accordingly, 
profit before tax stood at Birr 7.45 Billion from 
Birr 4.82 Billion of last year same period; i.e. Birr 
2.6 Billion or 54.5 percent growth. This is the 
highest profit ever registered in the history of our 
Bank as well as in the history of private banks. 
The paid-up capital has reached Birr 10.29 Billion 
from Birr 8.19 Billion of last year same period; 
that is, an increment of Birr 2.1 Billion or 25.65%. 
In spite of the capital increment, the pace of the 
growth of profit was even higher and as a result, 
earnings per share (EPS) has shown a significant 
growth from 470 in 2021 to 570 in 2022 for a 
par value of Birr 1,000 which, I believe, is very 
lucrative to the shareholders.
As a result of, among others, enhanced operation 
of the Bank and inflationary situation for goods 
and services, total expense of the Bank, including 
interest expense, has gone up from Birr 8.40 
Billion in 2021 to Birr 12.33 Billion in 2022. Of 
the total expense items, personnel expenses, 
interest expense, and other operating expenses 
took the highest share in their order.
Total deposit as at June 30, 2022 stood at Birr 
151.64 Billion and that was the highest deposit 
balance ever registered in our Bank as well as in 
the history of private banks. The deposit balance 
grew by Birr 43.87 Billion or 41% in 2022 as 
compared to 2021.
Total asset significantly grew from Birr 128.70 
Billion in 2021 to Birr 183.4 Billion in 2022; i.e., 
a growth of Birr 54.70 Billion or 42.51%, and that 
was the highest figure by all standards. Loans 
and advances took the biggest share of the total 
asset accounting for Birr 126.9 Billion or 69.20% 
of the total asset of the Bank. 
The NPLs ratio as at June 30, 2022 stood at 1.2% 
and this was far below the threshold; i.e. 5%, set 
by the NBE. The NPLs ratio in comparison with the 
total loan portfolio was not as such a concerning 
issue but still all possible effort will be exerted 
to keep it at the lowest possible limit.
Our Bank has opened 159 branches in the fiscal 
year and the total number of branches as at end 
of June 2022 reached 725.
Despite the ups and downs, the financial year 
2021 was thriving in many aspects to the banking 
industry in general and to our Bank in particular. 
Some of the major success stories were the 
following:
1.	
For the sixth time, our Bank has successfully 
achieved all the targets set in the Grand 
24
Nurturing Like the River
Annual  Report  2021/22
iv.	 Country-level double-digit inflation rate 
for food and non-food items is expected 
to escalate the expenses of the Bank. 
Thus, cost minimization strategies have to 
be devised internally and put in place to 
tackle the problem, etc…
I am, however, very optimistic that things will 
settle down in due course of time and Awash will 
keep on doing even better to satisfy the interests 
of its stakeholders. I believe that with our 
renewed commitment and concerted effort, we 
can succeed in our business objectives as success 
is nothing but it’s all about Seeing our ultimate 
goals, Understanding the obstacles, Creating a 
positive mental picture, Clearing our mind of 
self-doubt, Embracing the challenges, Staying on 
track and Showing the world that we can do it!
Taking this opportunity, I would like to extend my 
heart-felt appreciation once again to our valued 
customers for their loyalty, and committed 
Management and hardworking staff members 
for the remarkable performance registered in 
2021/22.
Finally, I would like to extend my gratitude 
to all Shareholders, Board of Directors, our 
Correspondent Banks, Federal and Regional 
Government Offices and particularly the National 
Bank of Ethiopia and Financial Intelligence Center 
for their unreserved support, advice and guidance 
rendered to us in our day-to-day activities. 
God bless you all and our country!
Strategy. Hence, our journey framed six years 
before to “Become One of the Top Ten East 
African Commercial Banks by the Year 2025” is 
likely to be attainable and
2.	
Our Bank has entered into a contractual 
agreement with an internationally renowned 
strategy 
development 
company 
named 
McKinsey and Company for the development 
of a Corporate Strategy. Once everything 
is finalized, the recommendations of the 
consultancy company will be put in place and 
that will enhance the competitive position of 
our Bank in the industry.
	 Going forward, the year 2022/23 and ahead 
are expected to be very challenging. Banks are 
especially expected to be challenged with the 
following realities:
i.	The Council of Ministers of the F
.D.R.E. has 
approved a new policy that will open up the 
banking industry to foreigners. Thus, a lot 
of foreign banks are expected to join the 
industry which will make the competition 
more stiff.
ii.	
A number of new local banks have joined 
the industry in the fiscal year. Thus, 
business will not be as usual from now on 
and we need to tighten our belts for the 
upcoming fierce competition between local 
and foreign banks.
iii.	The 70% foreign currency surrender 
requirement will erode the foreign currency 
stocks of banks and as a result, the ever-
increasing demands of importers may not 
be satisfactorily addressed and finally,

T
he Board of Directors of Awash Bank 
is honored to present the Bank’s 
Annual Report and Audited Financial 
Statements for the Financial Year ended June 
30, 2022 to the 27th Annual General Meeting 
of its esteemed Shareholders.
During the reporting period, Awash Bank 
continued to deliver superior operational and 
financial performances, in spite of slowdown 
in global economic growth and challenging 
domestic economic environments.
During the financial year 2021/22, the world 
economy has been suffering from a series of 
destabilizing shocks. After more than two 
years of Covid 19 pandemic, the war between 
Russia and Ukraine and its global effects on 
commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, 
and financial conditions have steepened the 
slowdown in global growth. In particular, the 
Ukraine-Russia war has soared energy and 
agricultural commodity prices, exacerbating 
food insecurity and extreme poverty in many 
emerging markets and developing economies 
(EMDEs).
The domestic macroeconomy was also 
challenged by double-digit inflation, shortage 
of foreign currency and internal conflicts in 
some parts of the country.  
Similarly, the banking industry has faced 
various challenges during FY 2021/22, 
including stiff competition among existing 
and new entrant banks, weak business 
environment and stringent policies by the 
National Bank of Ethiopia (such as provisional 
suspension 
of 
collateral-based 
loan 
disbursements for about four months and 70% 
foreign exchange surrender requirements).
1. OPERATIONAL 	
  	
	
 	
     PERFORMANCES
Awash Bank has registered another set of 
impressive operational and financial results 
during FY 2021/22, indicating the fact 
that the Bank is on the right track towards 
attaining its aspiration of becoming “One 
of the Top Ten Private Banks in East Africa 
by 2025”. Indeed, the Bank has cemented 
its leading position in key performance 
areas such as total deposits, total loans and 
advances, total assets, profit and capital 
base.
1.1 Deposits Mobilization
Total deposits of the Bank, including L/C 
margin and deposits from Interest Free 
Banking (IFB) rose to Birr 152 billion at 
the end of June 30,2022, up by Birr 43.9 
billion (41 percent) from last year same 
period. This commendable and consistent 
deposit growth of the Bank is attributed 
to the implementation of various strategic 
initiatives including expansion of service 
delivery channels and customer base, and 
offering of different deposit products to 
different customer segments. During FY 
2021/22 alone, more than 2.6 million new 
customers have opened deposit accounts at 
Awash Bank. 
Deposits mobilized from Interest Free 
Banking line of business has witnessed 
encouraging performance and reached Birr 
11.4 billion as at June 30, 2022; registering a 
net increment of Birr 3.9 billion (52 percent) 
over previous year same period.
Based on the strategic direction of the Bank to 
focus more on stable and low-cost deposits, 
saving deposits continued to account for 
the lion’s share (59.7 percent) of the total 
deposit, followed by demand deposits (32.7 
percent), time deposits (5 percent) and 
letter of credit margin (2.6 percent).

quality, conducting close follow-up of the borrowes situation and taking corrective measures 
before the loans slip into non-performing status.  As a result of these efforts, the Non-
Performing-Loans (NPLs) ratio was maintained at 1.2 percent, which is significantly below

1.3 International Banking 	
  	
      Services
Awash Bank continues to play a key role in 
supporting the international trade activities 
by providing diversified trade finance services 
to both exporters and importers. Moreover, 
in order to enhance the foreign exchange 
earning capacity of the country, the total 
loans and advances availed to export sector 
soared to Birr 27.6 billion at the end of June 
30,2022. 
On the other hand, as a mechanism of 
boosting 
inward 
remittances 
through 
international money transfer agents and 
bank to bank transfers, the Bank continued 
to use the lottery-based scheme dubbed 
“ይቆጥቡ፣ ይቀበሉ፣ ይሸለሙ”-meaning “Save, 
Receive and Win” to motivate both savers 
9th Round Lottery Winners Award
and recipient of remittances to conduct 
transactions through Awash Bank and win 
the lottery prizes.  Accordingly, the Bank 
has colorfully awarded the 9th round lottery 
winners and launched the 10th round lottery 
scheme during FY 2021/22. Moreover, the 
Bank has strengthened its strategic alliance 
with various international organizations, 
religious institutions and correspondent 
banks in a bid to increase foreign exchange 
earnings.
The effort of the Bank to enhance its 
foreign exchange earnings through different 
mechanisms has culminated in earnings 
of a record high USD 1.25 billion during FY 
2021/22.  Awash Bank was, in fact, not only 
the first but also the only Ethiopian private 
bank to surpass the one billion USD mark in 
total foreign currency generation at the end 
of the reporting period.
33
Nurturing Like the River

1.4 Total Assets
During FY 2021/22, the total asset size of the Bank grew significantly and stood at Birr 183.4 
billion by the end of June 30,2022; up by Birr 54.7 billion (42.5 percent) over last year same 
period. The exhibited surge in asset size was largely attributed to the increase in loans and 
advances and investment on fixed assets, which is a foundation for sustainable growth in the 
long run.
Figure 3: Trends in Total Assets (In Billions of Birr)
1.5 Capital 
During the financial year 2021/22, the paid-up capital of the Bank grew substantially by Birr 
2.1 billion and stood at Birr 10.3 billion at the end of June,2022. This significant growth 
manifests the determination of the shareholders to raise the paid-up capital of the Bank to 
Birr 12 billion by the end of June 30,2023.
Awash Bank is not only the most capitalized private bank in Ethiopia but also the Bank whose 
paid-up capital double of the minimum statutory requirement of Birr 5 billion set by the NBE, 
which all existing commercial banks operating in Ethiopia are required to meet by June 30, 
2026.  Nevertheless, in line with the strategic aspirations of the Bank to become One of the 
Top Ten Banks in East Africa by 2025, the need to build its new Headquarter’s Complex, and 
to withstand competitions from foreign banks, Awash Bank has to increase its paid-up capital 
commensurate with its fast growth.  
2. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
During the period under consideration, Awash Bank has once again registered a record 
high financial result and sustained its leadership position among private banks operating in 
Ethiopia.

2.1 Income
Awash Bank generated a total income of Birr 20.6 billion during financial year 2021/22, 
from Birr 13.7 billion a year earlier, indicating a growth of Birr 6.9 billion (50.2 percent) 
as compared with the same period of last year, driven by a remarkable increase in all 
components of income. Interest income rose by 42.8 percent and stood at Birr 14.2 billion, 
attributed  to the significant increases in loans and advances. Similarly, income from fees 
and commissions as well as other operating incomes grew by 89.4 percent and 25.9 percent, 
respectively, indicating a surge in income associated with foreign currency transactions, 
issuance of letters of credit and gains on foreign currency dealings.
In terms of composition, interest income took the lion’s share of total income (69 percent), 
followed by fees and commission income (24 percent) and other operating income (7 percent). 
Following the strategic direction of the Bank to diversify its source of income, the share of 
non-interest income soared to 31 percent at the end of June 2022, from 28 percent a year 
ago.

2.2. Expenses
The total expenses of the Bank surged to Birr 13.2 billion by the end of June 2022, up by 47.9 
percent from previous year similar period. This surge in total expense of the Bank was mainly 
derived by an increase in personnel and interest expenses.  
Personnel expenses increased by Birr 2.2 billion (62.9 percent) and reached Birr 5.7 billion as 
at June 30, 2022, mainly driven by significant branch expansions during the year (opening up 
of 159 new branches) and staff salary increment. Similarly, interest expenses increased by 
Birr 1.1 billion (32.3 percent) and reached Birr 4.4 billion, on account of growth in interest 
bearing saving and time deposits. 
Expense structure of the Bank was dominated by personnel expenses, which accounted for 
43 percent of the total expenses, followed by interest expenses (33 percent) and other 
operating expenses (11 percent). The remaining 13 percent of total expenses was accounted 
by loss allowance on financial assets (7 percent) depreciation and amortization expenses (6 
percent).

2.3 Profit 
Awash Bank registered a recorded high profit before tax of Birr 7.45 billion during financial 
year 2021/22; up by 54 .5 percent over previous year. This performance was not only a 
record high in the history of Awash Bank but also in the history of private banks operating 
in Ethiopia. Similarly, profit after tax surged to Birr 5.34 billion during the financial year 
2021/22. Subsequently, earnings per share also significantly increased to 570 per 1,000 par 
value during the financial year 2021/22 from 470 in previous year. This increase in earnings 
per share is commendable given the significant increase in paid-up capital of the Bank during 
the period under review.

3.2 Human Capital 
As at June 30 2022, the Bank’s total staff has reached 17,393. Awash Bank’s success in the 
period under review was mainly attributed to the hard work and unwavering commitment 
of its staff who continue to focus and engage in executing the Bank’s Strategy. The Bank

commitment and assiduousness. 
To further sustain its growth and leadership position, the Bank continued to invest in enhancing

4. Interest Free Banking (IFB) Sharia Advisory Committee’s Report for 
Financial Year 2021/22
Sharia Advisory Committee
“In the name of Allah, the most Compassionate, the most Merciful”
To the Bank’s Board of Directors, all stakeholders and depositors:
Ustaz Sultan Aman Eba
Chairman
Mohammedhakim Ahmed (Dr.)
D/Chairman
Ustaz Hassen Abdulnasir Ali
Member
In 
compliance 
with 
the 
duties 
and 
responsibilities vested on us in the Bank’s 
Shariah Advisory Committee Charter and the 
letter of appointment thereafter, we are 
required to ensure that Awash Bank’s IFB 
operations are in compliance with the Islamic 
Shariah Principles as well as those required 
by NBE Directive SBB/72/2019, Art 2.2. 
In  this regard, it has been our regular 
duties and responsibilities to conduct 
periodic review of products and services to 
assure that IFB operational activities and 
transactions within the Bank and its IFB 
policies and procedures issued henceforth 
are in compliance with Shariah principles 
and requirements.
To this end, we are required to issue and 
submit this report, which complies with the 
international best practices, to be published 
on the Bank’s annual financial report. 
Accordingly, Awash Bank is offering the 
following IFB services in fund mobilization, 
fund utilization and service-based products 
at its more than 725 branches, among which 
42 (Forty-two) are full-fledged IFB Branches, 
designated as “Ikhlas”, which is brand name 
for the Bank’s Interest Free Banking Services.
All of the products are reviewed and certified 
by us as being Shariah-compliant.

ü	 Hawalah (Hiwalah), etc.
We have reviewed the products listed 
above with their respective expected 
Shariah principles, the relevant contracts, 
transactions and IFB core banking introduced 
by Awash Bank during the year ended June 
30, 2022. In addition, we have assessed the 
IFB policies and procedures adopted by the 
Bank, examined sample transactions, the 
relevant documentations, all information and 
explanations which we considered necessary 
and sufficiently provide us evidence to 
give reasonable assurance that Awash Bank 
operations have not violated the Shariah 
principles. 
In our opinion, generally, we, the Shariah 
Advisory Committee of Awash Bank, do 
hereby confirm that: 
1.	 The IFB Products mentioned above, 
Operational procedures, contracts, 
transactions and dealings entered into 
by the Bank during the year ended 
30 June 2022 that we have reviewed 
are in compliance with the Shariah 
principles and the Shariah rulings 
related to IFB operations. 
2.	 Mudarabah deposits and financing 
(Profit-Loss Sharing) is not yet started 
and thus, there is no allocation of 
profit and charging of losses relating 
to investment accounts; 
3.	 The profits generated by the Bank, 
from Murabaha and other services 
like Kafalah, are Shariah-compliant 
and there are no earnings that have 
been realized from sources prohibited 
by the Shariah principles and thus, 
no fund is expected to be disposed 
to charitable causes from the Bank’s 
profit. However, ETB 16,430,190.87 
was 
collected 
from 
defaulted 
customers in the form of penalty 
which must be given to Charity. 
Accordingly, the Shariah Advisory 
Committee of the Bank ordered to use 
this fund for supporting communities 
of selected eleven various geographic 
areas across the country, where 
drought, war, famine and shortage of 
health services are acute. The Shariah 
Advisory Committee of the Bank 
appreciates commitment of the Bank 
CEO for implementing the order. 
Thank You (Jazakumullah Khairan)!

2.1 Introduction to summary of significant accounting policies
2.2 Basis of preparation
Awash International Bank S.C. ("Awash Bank or the Bank") is a private commercial bank domiciled in Ethiopia.
The Bank was established in November 1994, in accordance with the provisions of the Commercial Code of
Ethiopia of 1960 and the Licensing and Supervision of Banking Business Proclamation No. 592/2008. The Bank's
registered office is at:
The Bank is principally engaged in the provision of diverse range of financial products and services to
corporate, retail and SME clients base in Ethiopian market.
Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2022 have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
("IASB"). Additional information required by National regulations is included where appropriate. 
The financial statements comprise the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the
statement of financial position, the statement of changes in equity, the statement of cash flows and the notes
to the financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern principle under the
historical cost concept, except for the following;
•    defined benefit pension plans – plan assets measured at fair value.
•    Equity investments which is measured at fair value.
All values are rounded to the nearest thousand, except when otherwise indicated. The financial statements
are presented in thousands of Ethiopian Birr (ETB' 000).
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Bank’s
accounting policies. Changes in assumptions may have a significant impact on the financial statements in the
period the assumptions changed. Management believes that the underlying assumptions are appropriate and
that the Bank's financial statements, therefore, present the financial position and results fairly. The areas
involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant 
to the financial statements, are disclosed in Note 3.

New Standards, amendments, interpretations effective and adopted during the year.
 Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2021 Cycle.
• Interest Rate Benchmark Reform
New Standards, amendments, interpretations issued but not adopted.
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts
IFRS 17 was issued in May 2017 as replacement for IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts. It requires a current
measurement model where estimates are re-measured in each reporting period. The new rules will affect the
financial statements and key performance indicators of all entities that issue insurance contracts or
investment contracts with discretionary participation features. The standard Originally 1 January 2021, but
extended to 1 January 2023 by the IASB in March 2020.
– amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7. This did not have an impact on the Bank’s financial statements as the 
Bank does not have hedging contracts.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The management have no doubt that 
the Bank would remain in existence after 12 months.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – clarifies which fees should be included in the 10% test for derecognition of
financial liabilities. This change did not have an impact on the Bank’s financial statements.
IFRS 16 Leases – amendment to remove the illustration of payments from the lessor relating to leasehold
improvements, to remove any confusion about the treatment of lease incentives. This change did not have an
impact on the Bank’s financial statements.
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Basis of preparation (Continued)
The Bank has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for the annual reporting
period  commencing 1 July 2021:
•  Definition of Material – amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8
• Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39  and IFRS 7
•  Revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Basis of preparation (Continued)
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures (Continued)
Onerous Contracts– Cost of Fulfilling a Contract Amendments to IAS 37
The amendment to IAS 37 clarifies that the direct costs of fulfilling a contract include both the incremental
costs of fulfilling the contract and an allocation of other costs directly related to fulfilling contracts. Before
recognising a separate provision for an onerous contract, the entity recognises any impairment loss that has
occurred on assets used in fulfilling the contract. The standard effective on 1 January 2022. 
These standards are not expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or future reporting
periods and on foreseeable future transactions.
Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current – Amendments to IAS 1
The narrow-scope amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements clarify that liabilities are
classified as either current or non- current, depending on the rights that exist at the end of the reporting
period. Classification is unaffected by the expectations of the entity or events after the reporting date (e.g.,
the receipt of a waver or a breach of covenant).
The amendments also clarify what IAS 1 means when it
refers to the ‘settlement’ of a liability. The amendments could affect the classification of liabilities,
particularly for entities that previously considered management’s intentions to determine classification and
for some liabilities that can be converted into equity. They must be applied retrospectively in accordance
with the normal requirements in IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. The
standard effective on 1 January 2022 [deferred to 1 January 2023].
Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before intended use – Amendments to IAS 16
The amendment to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E) prohibits an entity from deducting from the
cost of an item of PP&E any proceeds received from selling items produced while the entity is preparing the
asset for its intended use. It also clarifies that an entity is ‘testing whether the asset is functioning properly’
when it assesses the technical and physical performance of the asset. The financial performance of the asset
is not relevant to this assessment. Entities must disclose separately the amounts of proceeds and costs
relating to items produced that are not an output of the entity’s ordinary activities. The standard effective on
1 January 2022. 
Reference to the Conceptual Framework – Amendments to IFRS 3
Minor amendments were made to IFRS 3 Business Combinations to update the references to the Conceptual
Framework for Financial Reporting and add an exception for the recognition of liabilities and contingent
liabilities within the scope of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and Interpretation
21 Levies. The amendments also confirm that contingent assets should not be recognised at the acquisition
date. The standard effective on 1 January 2022.

2.3 Investment in associates 
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Basis of preparation (Continued)
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures (Continued)
The statement of profit or loss reflects the Bank’s share of the results of operations of the associate. Any
change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Bank’s OCI. In addition, when there has been a
change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the Bank recognises its share of any changes, when
applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions
between the Bank and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.
After application of the equity method, the Bank determines whether it is necessary to recognise an
impairment loss on its investment in its associate. At each reporting date, the Bank determines whether there
is objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Bank
calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and
its carrying value, then recognises the loss as ‘Share of profit of an associate and a joint venture’ in the
statement of profit or loss.
Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Bank measures and recognises any retained
investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of
significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in
statement of profit or loss.
The following amended standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements of
the Bank.
• Amendments to references to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards
•Sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture – Amendments to IFRS 10
and IAS 28
• IFRS 3 Definition of a Business
• Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards
An associate is an entity over which the Bank has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to
participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control
over those policies. The Bank’s investments in its associates are accounted for using the equity method. Under
the equity method, the investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the
investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Bank’s share of net assets of the associate since the
acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is
neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment.

2.4 Foreign currency translation
a) Functional and presentation currency
b) Transactions and balances
2.5 Recognition of income and expenses
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Bank and
the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at
the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of
payment and excluding taxes or duty.
The Bank earns income from interest on
loans and advances given to customers, service charges and
commissions from customers, interest income from Deposits with local and correspondent banks, investment
in NBE (National Bank of Ethiopia) bills. Other income includes incomes like foreign currency transactions,
dividend, rental, and other miscellaneous incomes.
Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the Bank operates ('the functional currency'). The functional currency and presentation
currency of the Bank is the Ethiopian Birr (ETB). 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign
currency transactions and from the translation at exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in currencies other than the Bank's functional currency are recognised in profit or loss within
other (loss)/income. Monetary items denominated in foreign currency are translated using the closing rate as
at the reporting date.
Changes in the fair value of monetary securities denominated in foreign currency classified as available for
sale are analysed between translation differences resulting from changes in the amortised cost of the security
and other changes in the carrying amount of the security. Translation differences related to changes in
amortised cost are recognised in profit or loss, and other changes in carrying amount are recognised in other
comprehensive income.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value
through profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation
differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at fair value, such as equities classified as FVOCI, are
included in other comprehensive income.

c.        Calculation of interest income and expense
— the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; 
— the amortised cost of the financial liability. 
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest
income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the
asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.
For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying
the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the asset. The calculation of interest
income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves. 
Interest income and expense are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The
‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through
the expected life of the financial instrument to:
In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount
of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments other than credit-impaired assets, the
Bank estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not
expected credit losses. For credit-impaired financial assets, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate is
calculated using estimated future cash flows including expected credit losses.
The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees and points paid or received
that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, if the amount is material. Transaction costs include
incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial
liability.
The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or
financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the
cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount
and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance (or
impairment allowance before 1 July 2018). 
The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for
any expected credit loss allowance.

Interest income and expense on all trading assets and liabilities are considered to be incidental to the Bank’s
trading operations and are presented together with all other changes in the fair value of trading assets and
liabilities in net trading income. 
This is recognised when the Bank’s right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when the
shareholders approve and declare the dividend.
These are gains and losses arising on settlement and translation of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the functional currency’s mid rate of exchange at the reporting date.
This amount is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and it is further broken down into realised and
unrealised portion.  
The monetary assets and liabilities include financial assets within the foreign currencies deposits received and
held on behalf of third parties etc.   
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

interest basis;
— interest on debt instruments measured at FVOCI calculated on an effective interest basis;
— the effective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivatives designated in cash flow hedges
of variability in interest cash flows, in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect interest
income/expense; and
— the effective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivatives designated in fair value hedges
of interest rate risk.
When a loan commitment is not expected to result in the draw-down of a loan, loan commitment fees are
recognised on a straight-line basis over the commitment period.
Other fees and commission expenses relate mainly to transaction and service fees and are expensed as the
services are received.
Interest income and expense on other financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL are presented in net
income from other financial instruments at FVTPL.
Fees and commission income and expenses that are integral to the effective interest rate on a financial asset
or liability are included in the measurement of the effective interest rate. Other fees and commission income
such as rental income, telephone and SWIFT are recognised as the related services are performed.
Interest income and expense presented in the statement of profit or loss and OCI include:

In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets
the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI or at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or
significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise .
All other financial assets that do not meet the classification criteria at amortised cost or FVOCI, above, shall
be classified as measured at FVTPL.
The Bank shall initially recognise loans and advances, deposits, debt securities issued and subordinated
liabilities on the date on which they are originated. All other financial instruments (including regular-way
purchases and sales of financial assets) shall be recognised on the trade date, which is the date on which the
Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A financial asset or financial liability shall be measured initially at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value
through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. 
On initial recognition, a financial asset shall be classified either as measured at either amortised cost, fair
value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
The Bank shall measure a financial asset at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is
not designated at FVTPL:
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
On initial recognition, an equity investment that is held for trading shall be classified at FVTPL. However, for
equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes
in fair value in other comprehensive income (OCI). This election is made on an investment-by-investment
basis.

and 
— the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely
payments of principal and interest (SPPI). `
A debt instrument shall be measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not
designated at FVTPL: 
— the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash
flows and selling financial assets; and 
— the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

Financial assets and financial liabilities (continued)
-         Business model assessment 
-         Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest 
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Bank considers the contractual terms of the
instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change
the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the
assessment, the Bank considers: 
For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ shall be defined as the fair value of the financial asset on
initial recognition. ‘Interest’ shall be defined as the consideration for the time value of money and for the
credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other
basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as profit margin.
— the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In
particular, whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest revenue, maintaining a
particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities
that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets; 
— how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Bank’s management; 
— the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that
business model) and its strategy for how those risks are managed; 
— how managers of the business are compensated (e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of
the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected); and 
— the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations
about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as
part of an overall assessment of how the Bank’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved
and how cash flows are realised. 
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis
shall be measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to
collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. 
Financial assets shall not be reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the
Bank changes its business model for managing financial assets. 
The Bank shall make an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a
portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to
management. The information considered includes:

are measured as 12-month ECL: 
— contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows; 
— leverage features; 
— prepayment and extension terms; 
— terms that limit the Bank’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse loans); and

At each reporting date, the Bank shall assess whether there is objective evidence that financial assets (except
equity investments), other than those carried at FVTPL, are impaired.

Financial guarantees issued by the Bank are initially measured at their fair values and, if not designated as at
FVTPL, are subsequently measured at the higher of: the amount of the obligation under the guarantee, as
determined in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets; and the amount 
initially recognised less, where appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with the
revenue recognition policies.
The Bank shall recognise loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECL) on the following financial
instruments that are not measured at FVTPL: 
— debt investment securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and 
— other financial instruments (other than lease receivables) on which credit risk has not increased
significantly since their initial recognition. 
— financial assets that are debt instruments; 
— lease receivables; 
— financial guarantee contracts issued; and 
— loan commitments issued. 
No impairment loss shall be recognised on equity investments. 
The Bank shall classify its financial liabilities, other than financial guarantees and loan commitments, as
measured at amortised cost or FVTPL.
A financial guarantee is an undertaking/commitment that requires the issuer to make specified payments to
reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified party fails to meet its obligation when due in
accordance with the contractual terms.

i)        Measurement of ECL 
ii)        Restructured financial assets 
Where the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced
with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then the Bank shall assess whether the financial
asset should be derecognised and ECL are measured as follows:
— If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash
flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing
asset.
— If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value
of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its
derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that
are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective
interest rate of the existing financial asset.
ECL is a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. It shall be measured as follows: 
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Loss allowances for lease receivables shall always be measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.
12-month ECL is the portion of ECL that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible
within the 12 months after the reporting date. Financial instruments for which a 12-month ECL is recognised
are referred to as ‘Stage 1 financial instruments’.
Life-time ECL is the ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial
instrument. Financial instruments for which a lifetime ECL is recognised but which are not credit-impaired are
referred to as ‘Stage 2 financial instruments’.
— for financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date (stage 1 and 2): as the present value
of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the Bank in accordance with the
contract and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive); 
— for financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date (stage 3): as the difference between the
gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows; 
— for undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows
that are due to the Bank if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Bank expects to
receive; and 
— for financial guarantee contracts: as the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that
the Bank expects to recover.

iii)        Credit-impaired financial assets 
iv)        Presentation of allowance for ECL in the statement of financial position 
Loss allowances for ECL shall be presented in the statement of financial position as follows: 
Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:
— significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer; 
— a breach of contract such as a default or past due event; 
— the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Bank on terms that the Bank would not consider otherwise; 
— it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or 
— the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties. 
A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition shall be considered to be
credit-impair unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced
significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90
days or more shall be considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different.
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
— for financial assets measured at amortised cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the
assets; 
— for loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts: generally, as a provision; 
— where a financial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Bank cannot
identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from those on the drawn component: the
Bank presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The combined amount is presented as a
deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over the
gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision; and 
— for debt instruments measured at FVOCI: no loss allowance is recognised in the statement of financial
position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance shall be
disclosed and is recognised in the fair value reserve. 
At each reporting date, the Bank shall assess whether financial assets carried at amortised cost, debt financial
assets carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial
assets’).
A financial asset shall be considered ‘credit impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental
impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred; or
— Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not
retain control of the financial asset.
The Bank shall assess whether a financial guarantee contract held is an integral element of a financial asset
that is accounted for as a component of that instrument or is a contract that is accounted for separately. 
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Loans and debt securities shall be written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable
expectation of recovering the amount in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the
Bank determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient
cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment shall be carried out at the
individual asset level.
The Bank shall derecognise a financial asset when:
Where the Bank determines that the guarantee is not an integral element of the debt instrument, then it shall
recognise an asset representing any prepayment of guarantee premium and a right to compensation for credit
losses. 
Where the Bank determines that the guarantee is an integral element of the financial asset, then any premium
payable in connection with the initial recognition of the financial asset shall be treated as a transaction cost
of acquiring it. The Bank shall consider the effect of the protection when measuring the fair value of the debt
instrument and when measuring ECL. 
Recoveries of amounts previously written off shall be included in ‘impairment losses on financial instruments’
in the statement of profit or loss and OCI. 
Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with
the Bank’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

— fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent
reimbursement of eligible transaction costs shall be included in the initial measurement of the asset; and 
— other fees are included in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.
If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification
is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with
substantially different terms.
If the Bank plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it
shall first consider whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place.
Where the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in
derecognition of the financial asset, then the Bank shall first recalculate the gross carrying amount of the
financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognises the resulting adjustment as
a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. Any costs or fees incurred and fees received as part of the
modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and shall be amortised over the
remaining term of the modified financial asset. 
Any interest in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the
Bank shall be recognised as a separate asset or liability.
If the terms of a financial asset are modified, then the Bank shall evaluate whether the cash flows of the
modified asset are substantially different. 
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the
carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of (i) the consideration
received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss
that had been recognised in OCI shall be recognised in profit or loss.
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI
shall not be recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities.
The Bank shall derecognise a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or
expire. 
If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original
financial asset shall be deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset shall be derecognised
(see (1.3)) and a new financial asset shall be recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any
fees received as part of the modification shall be accounted for as follows:

i)        Financial assets 
ii)        Financial liabilities 
At initial recognition, the Bank may designate certain financial assets as at FVTPL because this designation
eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch, which would otherwise arise.
The Bank shall designate certain financial liabilities as at FVTPL in either of the following circumstances: 
Income and expenses shall be presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS, or for gains and losses
arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Bank’s trading activity.
— the liabilities are managed, evaluated and reported internally on a fair value basis; or 
— the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. 
Where such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower, then the gain or loss
shall be presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it shall be presented as interest income
calculated using the effective interest rate method. 
The Bank shall derecognise a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified
liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms shall be
recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised
and consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. Consideration paid shall include non-financial assets
transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability. 
Financial assets and financial liabilities shall be offset and the net amount presented in the statement of
financial position when, and only when, the Bank currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the
amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Where the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost
of the liability shall be recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest
rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any costs and fees incurred are recognised as
an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modified
financial liability by re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument.

Cash and cash equivalents 
Murabaha is an interest free financing transaction which represents an agreement whereby the Bank buys a
commodity/good and sells it to a counterparty (customer) based on a promise received from that counterparty 
to buy the commodity according to specific terms and conditions. The selling price comprises of the cost of
the commodity/goods and a pre-agreed profit margin.
Interest Free export Financing Facility
The profit is quantifiable and contractually determined at the commencement of the contract. Murabaha
Income (profit) is recognised as it accrues over the life of the contract using the effective profit method
(EPRM) on the principal balance outstanding.
These products are carried at amortised cost less impairment.
Cash comprises cash on hand, deposits held on call with other banks, and other short term highly liquid
investments. Cash equivalents are deemed of immediate realization since they are easily convertible into cash
within three months following the date of the financial statements.
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
It is treated as financing receivables. Financing receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Interest Free export financing facility is a short term financing given to the borrower for three months free of
any charge or profit and not subject to discounting being a short term facility. Interest free export facility
financing is stated in the statement of financial position of the bank at fair value of the consideration given
(amount of disbursement) and subsequently, they shall be stated at disbursement amount less loss allowances
(if any).

Capital work-in-progress is not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use. They are disclosed
when reclassified during the year.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over
their estimated useful lives, as follows:
The Bank construct buildings in different cities mainly for image building, branches office and issue accounts
use. The remaining is rented out. If the building is rented up to 90% of the floor of the building, the building
shall be treated as PPE. If the building is rented out for more than 90% of the floor of the building, we ought
to transfer it to Investment property (IP).
Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment if the
recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be
replaced at intervals, the Bank recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and
depreciates them accordingly. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in statement of profit or
loss as incurred.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying value or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the bank and the
cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising on
derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying
value of the asset) is included in statement of profit or loss.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed
at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

Intangible assets

Impairment of non-financial assets
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition,
intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if
any. Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the
related expenditure is reflected in statement of profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is
incurred .
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite
lives are amortised over the useful economic life. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an
intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Changes in the
expected useful life, or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the
asset, are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or methodology, as appropriate, which are then
treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expenses on intangible assets with finite lives
are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss, if significant.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight–line method to write down the cost of intangible assets to their
residual values over the lower of their estimated useful lives of six years orbthe license duration for purchased
computer software.
The Bank assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If
any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Bank estimates the
asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating
unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from
other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no
such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are
corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair
value indicators.
The Bank bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared
separately for each of the Bank’s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and
forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is
calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.

Fair value measurement
For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an
indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication
exists, the Bank estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss
is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable
amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of
the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such
reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
Other assets are generally defined as claims held against other entities for the future receipt of money. The
other assets in the Bank's financial statements include the following:
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Prepayments are payments made in advance for services to be enjoyed in future. The amount is initially
capitalized in the reporting period in which the payment is made and subsequently amortised over the period
in which the service is to be enjoyed.
Other receivables are recognised upon the occurrence of an event or transaction as they arise and are
cancelled when payment is received.
The Bank measures financial instruments classified as available-for-sale at fair value at each statement of
financial position date. Fair value related disclosures for financial instruments and non-financial assets that
are measured at fair value or where fair values are disclosed are, summarised in the following notes:
•   Disclosures for valuation methods, significant estimates and assumptions Notes 3 and Note 4.7.1
•   Quantitative disclosures of fair value measurement hierarchy Note 4.7.2
•   Financial instruments (including those carried at amortised cost) Note 4.7.2
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on
the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
•   In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
•   In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.

Employee benefits
(a) Wages, salaries  and annual leave
The Bank provides post-employment schemes, including both defined benefit and defined contribution pension
plans and post employment benefits.
Wages, salaries, other allowances, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the period in which the
associated services are rendered by employees of the Bank. The Bank operates an accumulating leave policy;
this can be encashed when the employee is leaving employment or paid in cash if the bank rarely decides to
pay in cash. The Bank measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional
amount that the entity expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end
of each reporting period.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
The Bank uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data
are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use
of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
   Level 1 —  Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Bank
determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of
each reporting period.
The Bank’s management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement,
such as available-for-sale financial assets.

(b) Defined contribution plan
(c) Defined benefit plan
(d ) Termination benefits
The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present
value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. 
The Bank operates two defined contribution plans;
i)
pension scheme in line with the provisions of Ethiopian Pension of Private Organisation Employees
Proclamation No. 715/2011.
Funding under the scheme is 7% and 11% by employees and the Bank
respectively; 2% provident fund contribution is made by the bank for employees covered under pension
scheme.
ii)
provident fund contribution, funding under this scheme is 7% and 13% by employees and the Bank
respectively based on the employees' salary. Employer's contributions to this scheme are charged to profit or
loss and other comprehensive income in the period to which they relate.
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan
assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit
credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated
future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency
in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related
pension obligation.
The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognised in the statement of profit or loss in employee
benefit expense, except where included in the cost of an asset, reflects the increase in the defined benefit
obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes curtailments and settlements.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are
charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Termination benefits are payable to executive directors when employment is terminated by the Bank before
the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these
benefits. The Bank recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either: terminating
the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal;
or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.

(i) Bank as a lessee
A provision is recognised when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past
event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle
the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Bank expects
some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is
recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to
a provision is presented in statement of profit or loss net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate
that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in
the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as other operating expenses.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
The legal reserve which is a statutory reserve to which no less than 25% of the net profits after taxation shall
be transferred each year until such fund is equal to the capital. When the legal reserve equals the capital of
the Bank, the amount to be transferred to the legal reserve account shall be 10% of the annual net profit.
Profit-sharing and bonus plans
The Bank recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing based on a formula that takes
into consideration the profit attributable to the company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Bank
recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a
constructive obligation.
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
The Bank presents basic earnings per share for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share are calculated by
dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Bank by the weighted average number
of shares outstanding during the period.
At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Bank allocates
consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone price. However,
for leases of branches and office premises the Bank has elected not to separate non-lease components and
accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.

—fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;
—variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially
—measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;
—amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and
—the exercise price under a purchase option that the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments
in an optional renewal period if the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties
for early termination of a lease unless the Bank is reasonably certain not to terminate early.
The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when
there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the 
Bank’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Bank changes
its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised
in-substance fixed lease payment.
The Bank recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-
use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for
any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an
estimate of costs to dismantle and remove any improvements made to branches or office premises.
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement
date to the end of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment
losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:
When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount
of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has
been reduced to zero.
The Bank presents right-of-use assets in ‘property and equipment’ and lease liabilities in ‘other liabilities’ in
the statement of financial position.
The Bank determines its incremental borrowing rate by analysing its borrowings from various external sources
and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of asset leased.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily
determined, the Bank’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Bank uses its incremental borrowing rate
as the discount rate.

(ii) Bank as a lessor

Income tax
(a) Current income tax
(b) Deferred tax
The Bank applies the derecognition and impairment requirements in IFRS 16 to the net investment in the
lease. The Bank further regularly reviews estimated unguaranteed residual values used in calculating the gross
investment in the lease.
When the Bank acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether the lease is a finance lease or an
operating lease.
To classify each lease, the Bank makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all
of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a
finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Bank considers certain
indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.
The income tax expense or credit for the year is the tax payable on the current year’s taxable income based
on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and
liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at
the end of the reporting period in Ethiopia. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns
with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes
provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is recognised as temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they
arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred
tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax
assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes
levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where
there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
At inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Bank allocates the
consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone selling prices.

    3.1 
(a)
(b) Going concern basis
    3.2 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation at the reporting date, that
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying values of assets and liabilities within
the next financial year, are described below. The Bank based its assumptions and estimates on parameters
available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future
developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances beyond the control of the Bank.
Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
Judgments
In the process of applying the Bank’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgments,
which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
Lease commitments - Bank as lessee
The Bank has entered into commercial property leases. The Bank has determined, based on an evaluation of
the terms and conditions of the arrangements, such as the lease term not constituting a substantial portion of
the economic life of the commercial property, that it does not retain all the significant risks and rewards of
ownership of these properties and accounts for the contracts as leases.
The preparation of the Bank’s financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the
accompanying disclosures, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these
assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying value
of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.
Other disclosures relating to the Bank’s exposure to risks and uncertainties include:
• Capital management Note 4.6
• Financial risk management and policies Note 4
Estimates and assumptions
The Bank’s management has made an assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern and is satisfied
that it has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, management is not
aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Bank’s ability to continue as a
going concern, except that it has to make significant effort to reach the minimum capital requirement.
However, the financial statements continue to be prepared on going concern basis.

Impairment losses on loans and receivables
The Bank reviews its loan portfolios for impairment on an on-going basis. The Bank first assesses whether
objective evidence of impairment exists individually for loans and receivables that are individually significant,
and individually or collectively for loans and receivables that are not individually significant. Impairment
provisions are also recognised for losses not specifically identified but which, experience and observable data
indicate are present in the portfolio at the date of assessment. For individually significant loans and
receivables that have been deemed to be impaired, management deems that the cash flow from collateral
would arise within one year where the loans and receivables is back by collateral.
Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and
objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the portfolio when scheduling its future cash flows. The
methodology and assumptions used for estimating both the amount and timing of future cash flows are
reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.
The use of historical loss experience is supplemented with significant management judgment to assess
whether current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual level of inherent losses is likely to
differ from that suggested by historical experience. In normal circumstances, historical experience provides
objective and relevant information from which to assess inherent loss within each portfolio. In other
circumstances, historical loss experience provides less relevant information about the inherent loss in a given
portfolio at the balance sheet date, for example, where there have been changes in economic conditions such
that the most recent trends in risk factors are not fully reflected in the historical information. In these
circumstances, such risk factors are taken into account when calculating the appropriate levels of impairment
allowances, by adjusting the impairment loss derived solely from historical loss experience.
The detailed methodologies, areas of estimation and judgment applied in the calculation of the Bank's
impairment charge on financial assets are set out in the financial risk management section.
The estimation of impairment losses is subject to uncertainty, which has increased in the current economic
environment and is highly sensitive to factors such as the level of economic activity, unemployment rates,
property price trends and interest rates. The assumptions underlying this judgement are highly subjective. The
methodology and the assumptions used in calculating impairment losses are reviewed regularly in the light of
differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience. See note 3.2 for more information.
Fair value  measurement of financial instruments
When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the statement of financial position
cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation
techniques including the discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The inputs to these models are taken from
observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required in
establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and
volatility. As at year end, no financial instrument was measured at fair value. See Note 4.7.1 for further
disclosures.

(f) Income Taxes
Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount,
which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The fair value less costs of
disposal calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions, conducted at arm’s length, for
similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use
calculation is based on a DCF model. The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years and
do not include restructuring activities that the Bank is not yet committed to or significant future investments
that will enhance the asset’s performance of the CGU being tested. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the
discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the
growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. 
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the
amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and
the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the
actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future
adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. The amount of such provisions is based on various
factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the
taxable entity and the responsible tax authority.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit
will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to
determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the
level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.
Defined benefit plans
The cost of the defined benefit pension plan, long service awards and gratuity scheme and the present value
of these defined benefit obligations are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves
making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the
determination of the discount rate, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due
to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly
sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
Depreciation and carrying value of property, plant and equipment
The estimation of the useful lives and residual values of assets is based on management’s judgement. Any
material adjustment to the estimated useful lives of items of property and equipment will have an impact on
the carrying value of these items.

Financial risk management
4.1
Introduction
4.1.1 Risk management structure
Risk is inherent in the Bank’s activities, but is managed through a process of ongoing identification, measurement
and monitoring, subject to risk limits and other controls. This process of risk management is critical to the Bank’s
continuing profitability and each individual within the Bank is accountable for the risk exposures relating to his or
her responsibilities. The Bank is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and different operational risks. It is
also subject to various risks that affect the financial sector of the country.
The independent risk control process does not include business risks such as changes in the environment, technology
and industry. The Bank's policy is to monitor those business risks through the Bank’s strategic planning process.
The Board Risk Sub-Committee, a subset of the Board of Directors is responsible for the overall risk management
approach and for approving the risk management strategies and principles. It also has the responsibility to monitor
the overall risk process within the Bank.
The Senior Management chaired by the chief Executive Officer (CEO) has the overall responsibility for the
development of the risk strategy and implementing principles, frameworks, policies and limits. It is also responsible
for managing risk decisions and monitoring risk levels and reports on a monthly basis to the Board Risk Sub-
Committee.
The Risk Management Unit is responsible for implementing and maintaining risk related procedures to ensure an
independent control process is maintained. The unit works closely with the Senior Management to ensure that
procedures are compliant with the overall framework.
The Risk Management Unit is responsible for monitoring compliance with risk principles, policies and limits across the
Bank. It carries out an assessment of risk on an ad hoc basis to monitor the Bank's independent control of risks,
including monitoring the risk of exposures against limits and the assessment of risks of new products and structured
transactions. This unit also ensures the complete capture of the risks in risk measurement and reporting systems.
Exceptions are reported, where necessary, to the Senior Management, and further to the Board Risk Sub-Committee
and the relevant actions are taken to address exceptions and any areas of weakness.
The Bank Finance and Treasury function is responsible for managing the Bank’s financial assets, financial liabilities
and the overall financial structure. It is also primarily responsible for the funding and liquidity risks of the Bank.
The Bank’s policy is that risk management processes throughout the Bank are audited annually by the Internal Audit
Function, which examines both the adequacy of the procedures and the Bank’s compliance with the procedures. The
Internal Audit Function discusses the results of all assessments with management, and reports its findings and
recommendations to the Board Audit Sub-Committee.

The Bank’s risks are measured using a method that reflects both the expected loss likely to arise in normal
circumstances and unexpected losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss based on statistical models.
The models make use of probabilities derived from historical experience, adjusted to reflect the economic
environment. The Bank also runs worst-case scenarios that would arise in the event that extreme events, which are
unlikely to occur, do in fact, occur.
Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily performed based on limits established by the Bank. These limits reflect
the business strategy and market environment of the Bank as well as the level of risk that the Bank is willing to
accept, with additional emphasis on selected regions. In addition, the Bank’s policy is to measure and monitor the
overall risk bearing capacity in relation to the aggregate risk exposure across all risk types and activities.
Risk controls and mitigates, identified and approved for the Bank, are documented for existing and new processes
and systems.
The adequacy of these mitigates is tested on a periodic basis through administration of control self-assessment
questionnaires, using an operational risk management tool which requires risk owners to confirm the effectiveness of
established controls. These are subsequently audited as part of the review process.
The Bank's financial assets are classified into the following measurement categories: Financial assets at fair value
through OCI and Financial assets at amortized cost and the financial liabilities are classified into other liabilities at
amortised cost.
Financial instruments are classified in the statement of financial position in accordance with their legal form and
substance.

Credit risk
In measuring credit risk of Financial assets at amortized cost to various counterparties, the Bank considers the
character and capacity of the obligor to pay or meet contractual obligations, current exposures to the
counterparty/obligor and its likely future developments, credit history of the counterparty/obligor; and the likely
recovery ratio in case of default obligations-value of collateral and other solutions. Our credit exposure comprises
wholesale and retail Financial assets at amortized cost which are developed to reflect the needs of our customers.
The Bank’s policy is to lend principally on the basis of our customer’s repayment capacity through quantitative and
qualitative evaluation. However we ensure that our loans are backed by collateral to reflect the risk of the obligors
and the nature of the facility.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Bank if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to
meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Bank’s loans and advances to customers and other
banks and other financial assets.
Exposure to credit risk is managed through periodic analysis of the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to
determine their capacity to meet principal and interest thereon, and restructuring such limits as appropriate.
Exposure to credit risk is also mitigated, in part, by obtaining collateral, commercial and personal guarantees .
The Bank structures the levels of credit risk it undertakes by placing limits on the amount of risk accepted in relation
to one borrower, or groups of borrowers, and to term of the financial instrument and economic sectors.
The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) sets credit risk limit for a single borrower, one related party and all related
parties to not exceed 25%, 5% and 35%  of Bank’s total capital amount as of the reporting quarterly period
respectively. 
Credit management is conducted as per the risk management policy and guideline approved by the board of directors
and the Risk Management Committees. Such policies are reviewed and modified periodically based on changes and
expectations of the markets where the Bank operates, regulations, and other factors.

This denotes expectations of a very low default risk. It indicates a very strong capacity for
payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable
events.
This
denotes
expectations
of
low
default
risk.
The
capacity
for
payment
of
financial
commitments is considered strong. This capacity may, nevertheless, be more vulnerable to
adverse business or economic conditions than is the case for higher ratings.
This indicates that expectations of default risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of
financial commitments is considered adequate, but adverse business or economic conditions are
more likely to impair this capacity.
This indicates financial institutions or other counterparties with no available ratings and cash in
hand.
A "+ "(plus) or "-" (minus) may be appended to a rating to indicate the relative position of a credit within the rating 
category. This is based on Fitch national long-term issuer default ratings.
The credit quality of Cash and bank balances and short-term investments that were neither past due nor impaired at
as 30 June 2022 and 30 June 2021 and are held in Ethiopian banks have been classified as non-rated as there are no
credit rating agencies in Ethiopia. However, Cash and bank balances that is held in foreign banks can be assessed by
reference to credit rating agency designation as shown in the table below;

ii)      Investment securities designated as at FVTPL
See accounting policy in Note 2.6
i)        Loans and advances to customers
The general creditworthiness of a customer tends to be the most relevant indicator of credit quality of a loan
extended to it. However, collateral provides additional security and the Bank generally requests that corporate
borrowers provide it. The Bank may take collateral in the form of a first charge over real estate, floating charges
over all corporate assets and other liens and guarantees.
Because of the Bank’s focus on customers’ creditworthiness, the Bank does not routinely update the valuation of
collateral held against all loans to customers. Valuation of collateral of real estates (buildings) is updated and
reviewed every three year and at the same time whenever the loan foreclosure measure is opted. For credit-
impaired loans, the Bank obtains appraisals of collateral because it provides input into determining the management
credit risk actions.
AS at 30 June 2022, the net carrying amount of credit impaired loans and advances to customers amounted to ETB
2.440 billion (2021: ETB 1.247 billion) and the value of identifiable collateral held against those loans and advances
amounted to ETB 4.779 billion (2021: ETB 2.835 million). For each loan, the value of disclosed collateral is capped at
the nominal amount of the loan that it is held against.
As at 30 June 2022, the Bank had no exposure to credit risk of the investment securities designated as at FVTPL.

ii)      Significant increase in credit risk
When determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial
recognition, the Bank considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue
cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Bank’s
historical experience and expert credit assessment and including forward-looking information.
The objective of the assessment is to identify whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred for an
exposure by comparing:

iii)    Credit risk grades
The Bank allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on a variety of data that is determined to be
predictive of the risk of default and applying experienced credit judgement. Credit risk grades are defined using
qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of risk of default. These factors vary depending on the nature
of the exposure and the type of borrower.
Credit risk grades are defined and calibrated such that the risk of default occurring increases exponentially as the
credit risk deteriorates so, for example, the difference in risk of default between credit risk grades 1 and 2 is smaller
than the difference between credit risk grades 2 and 3. Each exposure is allocated to a credit risk grade on initial
recognition based on available information about the borrower. Exposures are subject to ongoing monitoring, which
may result in an exposure being moved to a different credit risk grade. The monitoring typically involves use of the
following data;
a.         Term loan exposures
—   Information obtained during periodic review of customer files – e.g. audited financial statements, management
accounts, budgets and projections. Examples of areas of particular focus are: gross profit margins, financial leverage
ratios, debt service coverage, compliance
—   Data from credit reference agencies, press articles, changes in external credit ratings
—   Actual and expected significant changes in the political, regulatory and technological environment of the
borrower or in its business activities
—   Internally collected data on customer behaviour – e.g. utilisation of credit card facilities
—   Affordability metrics
—   Payment record – this includes overdue status as well as a range of variables about payment ratios
—   Utilisation of the granted limit
—   Requests for and granting of forbearance
—   Existing and forecast changes in business, financial and economic conditions
Amounts arising from ECL  (Continued)
Credit risk grades are a primary input into the determination of the term structure of PD for exposures. The Bank
collects performance and default information about its credit risk exposures analysed by type of product and
borrower as well as by credit risk grading. The Bank employs statistical models to analyse the data collected and
generate estimates of the remaining lifetime PD of exposures and how these are expected to change as a result of
the passage of time.

As a backstop, the Bank considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when an asset is more
than 30 days past due. Days past due are determined by counting the number of days since the earliest elapsed due
date in respect of which full payment has not been received. Due dates are determined without considering any
grace period that might be available to the borrower.
The Bank monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify significant increases in credit risk by regular
reviews to confirm that:
there is no unwarranted volatility in loss allowance from transfers between 12-month PD (Stage 1) and lifetime PD
(Stage 2).
The Bank considers a financial asset to be in default when:
vi)    Definition of default
If there is evidence that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk relative to initial recognition, then the
loss allowance on an instrument returns to being measured as 12-month ECL. Some qualitative indicators of an
increase in credit risk, such as delinquency or forbearance, may be indicative of an increased risk of default that
persists after the indicator itself has ceased to exist. In these cases, the Bank determines a probation period during
which the financial asset is required to demonstrate good behaviour to provide evidence that its credit risk has
declined sufficiently. When contractual terms of a loan have been modified, evidence that the criteria for
recognising lifetime ECL are no longer met includes a history of up-to-date payment performance against the
modified contractual terms. 
the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank in full, without recourse by the Bank to actions
such as realising security (if any is held);
Overdrafts are considered as being past due once the customer has breached an advised limit or been advised of a
limit smaller than the current amount outstanding; or
it is becoming probable that the borrower will restructure the asset as a result of bankruptcy due to the borrower’s
inability to pay its credit obligations.
The Bank assesses whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition at each reporting date.
Determining whether an increase in credit risk is significant depends on the characteristics of the financial
instrument and the borrower. 
The credit risk may also be deemed to have increased significantly since initial recognition based on qualitative
factors linked to the Bank’s credit risk management processes that may not otherwise be fully reflected in its
quantitative analysis on a timely basis. This will be the case for exposures that meet certain heightened risk criteria,
such as placement on a watch list. Such qualitative factors are based on its expert judgment and relevant historical
experiences.

Periodically, the Bank carries out stress testing of more extreme shocks to calibrate its determination of the upside
and downside representative scenarios. A comprehensive review is performed at least annually on the design of the
scenarios by a panel of experts that advises the Bank’s senior management.
In assessing whether a borrower is in default, the Bank considers indicators that are:
Inputs into the assessment of whether a financial instrument is in default and their significance may vary over time
to reflect changes in circumstances.

vii)  Incorporation of forward-looking 
information
The Bank incorporates forward-looking information into both the assessment of whether the credit risk of an 
instrument has increased significantly since its initial recognition and the measurement of ECL.
For each segment, the Bank formulates three economic scenarios: a base case, which is the median scenario, and
two less likely scenarios, one upside and one downside. For each sector, the base case is aligned with the
macroeconomic model’s information value output, a measure of the predictive power of the model, as well as base
macroeconomic projections for identified macroeconomic variables for each sector. The upside and downside
scenarios are based on a combination of a percentage error factor of each sector model as well as simulated
optimistic and pessimistic macroeconomic projections based on a measure of historical macroeconomic volatilities.
The Bank has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for each portfolio of financial
instruments and, using an analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between macro-economic variables
and credit risk and credit losses.
External information considered includes economic data and forecasts published by Business Monitor International,
an external and independent macroeconomic data body. This is in addition to industry – level, semi – annual NPL
trends across statistically comparable sectors.

Generally, forbearance is a qualitative indicator of a significant increase in credit risk and an expectation of
forbearance may constitute evidence that an exposure is credit-impaired. A customer needs to demonstrate
consistently good payment behaviour over a period of time before the exposure is no longer considered to be credit-
impaired/in default or the PD is considered to have decreased such that the loss allowance reverts to being
measured at an amount equal to Stage 1.
Scenario probability weightings
As at June 2022
As at June 2021
The contractual terms of a loan may be modified for a number of reasons, including changing market conditions,
customer retention and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of the customer. An
existing loan whose terms have been modified may be derecognised and the renegotiated loan recognised as a new
loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy set out.
The Bank renegotiates loans to customers in financial difficulties (referred to as ‘forbearance activities’) to
maximise collection opportunities and minimise the risk of default. Under the Bank’s forbearance policy, loan
forbearance is granted on a selective basis if the debtor is currently in default on its debt or if there is a high risk of
default, there is evidence that the debtor made all reasonable efforts to pay under the original contractual terms
and the debtor is expected to be able to meet the revised terms.
The revised terms usually include extending the maturity, changing the timing of interest payments and amending
the terms of loan covenants. Both retail and corporate loans are subject to the forbearance policy. The Bank Credit
Committee regularly reviews reports on forbearance activities.
For financial assets modified as part of the Bank’s forbearance policy, the estimate of PD reflects whether the
modification has improved or restored the Bank’s ability to collect interest and principal and the Bank’s previous
experience of similar forbearance action. As part of this process, the Bank evaluates the borrower’s payment
performance against the modified contractual terms and considers various behavioural indicators.
viii)  Modified financial assets
When the terms of a financial asset are modified and the modification does not result in derecognition, the
determination of whether the asset’s credit risk has increased significantly reflects comparison of: its remaining
lifetime PD at the reporting date based on the modified terms; with the remaining lifetime PD estimated based on
data on initial recognition and the original contractual terms.
Amounts arising from ECL (Continued)
When modification results in derecognition, a new loan is recognised and allocated to Stage 1 (assuming it is not
credit-impaired at that time).

Credit risk (Continued)
4.3.6
The key inputs into the measurement of ECL are the term structure of the following variables:
—   Probability of default (PD);
—   loss given default (LGD); and
—   exposure at default (EAD)
As described above, and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for Stage 1 financial assets, the Bank
measures ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period (including any borrower’s
extension options) over which it is exposed to credit risk, even if, for credit risk management purposes, the Bank
considers a longer period. 
The maximum contractual period extends to the date at which the Bank has the right to require repayment of an
advance or terminate a loan commitment or guarantee. 
However, for overdrafts that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment component, the Bank measures ECL
over a period longer than the maximum contractual period if the Bank’s contractual ability to demand repayment
and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the Bank’s exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice
period. These facilities do not have a fixed term or repayment structure and are managed on a collective basis. The
Bank can cancel them with immediate effect but this contractual right is not enforced in the normal day-to-day
management, but only when the Bank becomes aware of an increase in credit risk at the facility level. This longer
period is estimated taking into account the credit risk management actions that the Bank expects to take, and that
serve to mitigate ECL. These include a reduction in limits, cancellation of the facility and/or turning the outstanding
balance into a loan with fixed repayment terms. 
ix)    Measurement of ECL
EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Bank derives the EAD from the current exposure
to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract and arising from
amortisation. The EAD of a financial asset is its gross carrying amount at the time of default. For lending
commitments, the EADs are potential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated
based on historical observations and forward-looking forecasts. For financial guarantees, the EAD represents the
amount of the guaranteed exposure when the financial guarantee becomes payable. For some financial assets, EAD is
determined by modelling the range of possible exposure outcomes at various points in time using scenario and
statistical techniques.
LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Bank estimates LGD parameters based on the history
of recovery rates of claims against defaulted counterparties. The LGD models consider the structure, collateral,
seniority of the claim, counterparty industry and recovery costs of any collateral that is integral to the financial
asset. 
Amounts arising from ECL (Continued)
The methodology of estimating PDs is discussed above under the heading ‘Generating the term structure of PD’.
ECL for exposures in Stage 1 is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD by LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated
by multiplying the lifetime PD by LGD and EAD.

The maximum exposure to credit risk relating to a financial guarantee is the maximum amount the Bank could have
to pay if the guarantee is called upon. The maximum exposure to credit risk relating to a loan commitment is the full
amount of the commitment. The table below shows the Bank’s maximum credit risk exposure for commitments and
guarantees.
—   Loans with renegotiated terms
Loans with renegotiated terms are defined as loans that have been restructured due to a deterioration in the
borrower’s financial position, for which the Bank has made concessions by agreeing to terms and conditions that are
more favourable for the borrower than the Bank had provided initially and that it would not otherwise consider. A
loan continues to be presented as part of loans with renegotiated terms until maturity, early repayment or write-off.
—   Loans that were past due but not impaired
Loans that were ‘past due but not impaired’ are those for which contractual interest or principal payments were past
due but the Bank believed that impairment was not appropriate on the basis of the level of security or collateral
available and/or the stage of collection of amounts owed to the Bank. The amounts disclosed exclude assets
measured at FVTPL.

Total financial liabilities
The table below analyses the Bank’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining
period at the statement of financial position date to the contractual maturity date. The cash flows presented are the
undiscounted amounts to be settled in future.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank cannot meet its maturing obligations when they become due, at reasonable
cost and in a timely manner. Liquidity risk arises because of the possibility that the Bank might be unable to meet its
payment obligations when they fall due as a result of mismatches in the timing of the cash flows under both normal
and stress circumstances. Such scenarios could occur when funding needed for illiquid asset positions is not available
to the Bank on acceptable terms.
Liquidity risk management in the Bank is solely determined by the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO), which bears
the overall responsibility for liquidity risk. The main objective of the Bank's liquidity risk framework is to maintain
sufficient liquidity in order to ensure that we meet our maturing obligations.
Assets held for managing liquidity 
risk 
Cash flow forecasting is performed by the Finance and Treasury function. The Finance and Treasury function
monitors rolling forecasts of liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs. 
The Bank has incurred indebtedness in the form of borrowings. The Bank evaluates its ability to meet its obligations
on an ongoing basis. Based on these evaluations, the Bank devises strategies to manage its liquidity risk.
Prudent liquidity risk management implies that sufficient cash is maintained and that sufficient funding is available
to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or
risk of damage to the Bank’s reputation.

management function regularly, to identify any adverse
movement in the underlying variables.
Market risk is defined as the risk of loss that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate because of changes in market risk factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices,
credit spreads and their volatilities. Market risk can arise in conjunction with trading and non-trading activities of a
financial institutions. 
The Bank does not ordinarily engage in trading activities as there are no active markets in Ethiopia. 
The main objective of Market Risk Management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable
parameters, while optimising the return on risk.

Total financial liabilities
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will be affected by changes in market interest
rates. Borrowings and lending obtained at variable rates give rise to interest rate risk. 
The Bank’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Bank’s obligations and
financial assets with floating interest rates. The Bank is also exposed on fixed rate financial assets and financial
liabilities. The Bank’s investment portfolio is comprised of treasury bills, Ethiopian government bonds and cash
deposits.

Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due
to the changes in foreign exchange rates. 
The Bank is exposed to exchange rate risks to the extent of balances and transactions denominated in a currency
other than the Ethiopian Birr (ETB). The Bank’s foreign currency bank accounts act as a natural hedge for these
transactions. Management has set up a policy to manage the Bank's foreign exchange risk against its functional
currency.
The table below summarises the impact of increases/decreases of 10% on equity and profit or loss arising from the
Bank's foreign denominated borrowings and cash and bank balances.
The total foreign currency denominated assets exposed to risk as at year end 30 June 2022 was ETB 8.383billion (30
June 2021: ETB 8.383billion).

Capital management
The Bank’s objectives when managing capital are to comply with the capital requirements set by the National Bank
of Ethiopia, safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, and to maintain a strong capital base so as to
maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.

According to the Licensing & Supervision of Banking Business Directive No SBB/50/2011 of the National Bank of
Ethiopia, the Bank has to maintain a capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 8% at all times, the risk weighted assets
being calculated as per the provisions of Directive No SBB/9/95 issued on 18 August 1995. Capital includes capital
contributions, retained earnings, legal reserve and other reserves to be approved by the National Bank of Ethiopia.

Capital adequacy ratio
The capital adequacy ratio is the quotient of the capital base of the Bank and the Bank’s risk weighted asset base.
IFRS 13 requires an entity to classify measured or disclosed fair values according to a hierarchy that reflects the
significance of observable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised
within the fair value hierarchy, which comprises three levels as described below, based on the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole.

IFRS 13 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are
observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources; unobservable
inputs reflect the Bank's market assumptions.
  - Financial assets at amortized cost 
Loans and advances to customers
The following table summarises the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the reporting date. The 
amounts are based on the values recognised in the statement of financial position.
● Level 1: Inputs that are quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
●Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) .This category includes instruments valued using:
quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in
markets that are considered less than active, another valuation technique in which all significant inputs are directly
or indirectly observable from market data.
In conclusion, this category is for valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
●Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). This
category includes all assets and liabilities for which the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable
data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the asset's or liability's valuation. This category
includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments for which significant
unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments.

Cash and bank balances in the statement of cash flows are the same as on the statement of financial position
as the Bank had no bank overdrafts at the end of each reporting period.
The total cash on hand and at bank includes ETB 40.919 miliion at the Bank's branches in the Tigray Region,
the existance of which could not be confirmed due to the current conflict. Moreover, we have reclassified
local deposits and treasury bills maturing in three months as cash and bank balances and the remaining as
investment securities.

The opening balance difference arose due to prior period adjustements made in the comparative period.
The Bank recognises a lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date.
The Bank uses an incremental borrowing rate that is based on the weighted average cost of deposits across the
years. The rates used to compute the present values of buildings lease liabilities as at 30 June 2022 was
10.81%. The adjustments are occurs due to changes in Incremental borrowing rate (IBR).
The Bank leases buildings for its office space and branches. The building leases typically run for a period
between 2 and 15 years with the majority of the contracts running for a period of 5 and 7 years. Some leases
include an option to renew the lease for an additional period at the end of the contract term. The renewal
term and lease rental cannot be reliably estimated before the end of a contract.
The Bank leases land for construction of its own office buildings. The land leases typically run for a period of
between 40 years and 70 years with majority of the contracts running for a period of 40 and 60 years. These
leases include an option to renew the lease.
The Bank leases a number of assets including land and buildings. Information about leases for which the Bank is 
a lessee is presented below:

Provision for doubtful debt and assets damage- North Ethiopia conflict - As a result of conflict in the Northern
Part of Ethiopia in Tigray Region, the management of the Bank has made prudential judgements and estimates
on the loss occurrance on the assets of the Bank. Thus, the Bank has made a total provision of ETB 201.758
million. Hence, the management belived that the Bank provided sufficient amount of provision. 
Tax payable includes tax on capital gain, value added taxes (VAT), income tax, tax on saving deposits interest 
paid and withholding taxes.

Severance and Gratuity 
The income statement charge included within personnel expenses includes current service cost, interest cost 
and past service costs on the defined benefit schemes and legal requirement.
The employee benefit plan is made up of two (2) unfunded schemes which are severance benefits that are
paid on voluntary withdrawal and retirement gratuity paid on retirement. These plans have been aggregated
in determining the retirement benefit obligation as the inherent risks applicable to these plans have been
assessed not to be materially different.
The key financial assumptions are the discount rate and the rate of salary increases. The provision for gratuity
was based on an independent actuarial valuation performed by QED Actuaries & Consultants (Pty) Ltd using
the projected unit credit method.
The Bank does not maintain any assets for the schemes but ensures that it has sufficient funds for the
obligations as they crystallise.

Below are the details of movements and amounts recognised in the financial statements:
The long service awards is the only applicable to employees that reach the retirement age. Employees who
attain this age while in a managerial position are entitled to 3 months final monthly salary while for other
employees, it is 2 months final salary. The scheme is not funded hence, there are no plan assets.
Bank Paid Benefits
The bank valued severance benefits payable on death or resignation after a minimum of 5 years’ service only
for all employees, as it is applied by the Bank.
Furthermore, one months’ salary is divided by 30 to get the daily salary applied in the severance benefit
calculation.
The severance benefits are based on statutory severance benefits in Ethiopia. The statutory severance
benefits are set out in Labour Proclamation No. 1156/2019. This benefit is summarised below:
Clause 39 (1) (h) of the Labour Proclamation sets out that any worker who has completed their probation and
who is not eligible for pension is entitled to a severance benefit:
h) Where he has given service to the employer for a minimum of five years’ service and his contract of
employment is terminated because of sickness or death or his contract of employment is terminated on his
own initiative provided that he has no contractual obligation relating to training to render service to the
employer
Clause 40 of the Labour Proclamation sets out the amount of the benefit, as follows:
The benefit applicable would be:
• thirty times the average daily wages of their last week of service for the first year of service, with part-
years pro-rata, plus
• ten times the average daily wages of their last week of service for each completed year of service after the
first.
To a maximum of one years’ wages payable to the member.Where the Company closes or reduces its work
force, an additional multiple of sixty times the average daily wages of their last week of service is payable.

 Mortality rate 
The rate of mortality assumed for employees are those published in the Demographic and Health Survey
(“DHS”) 2016 report compiled by the CSA. The DHS report provides male and female mortality rates for 5 year
age bands from age 15 to age 49. For ages over 47 we have assumed that mortality will be in line with the
SA85/90 ultimate standard South African mortality tables published by the Actuarial Society of South Africa
(“ASSA”), since the rates in these tables are similar to the DHS female mortality rate at age 47. These rates
combined are approximately summarized as follows:
The withdrawal rates are believed to be reasonably representative of the Ethiopian experience. The valuation
assumed a rate of withdrawal of 15% at the youngest ages falling with increasing age to 2.5% at age 45.
The sensitivity of the overall defined benefit liability to changes in the weighted principal assumption is:

There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior
years. The average duration of the gratuity scheme at the end of the reporting period is five years (30 June
2021: five years).
 Impact on defined benefit obligation 
 30 June 2022 
 30 June 2021 
The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions
constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same
method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at
the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within
the statement of financial position.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares
outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. There were no potentially dilutive
shares at the reporting date (30 June 2021:nil), hence the basic and diluted earnings per share have the same
value.
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the profit after taxation by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The NBE Directive No. SBB/4/95 requires the Bank to transfer annually 25% of its annual net profit to its legal
reserve account until such account equals its capital. When the legal reserve account equals the capital of the
Bank, the amount to be transferred to the legal reserve account will be 10% (ten percent) of the annual net
profit.

(b) The non-distributable reserve should be classified under Tier 1 as part of the core capital.
Provisions under prudential guidelines are determined using the time based provisioning prescribed by the
National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) Directives. This is at variance with the expected credit loss model required by
IFRS under IFRS 9. As a result of the differences in the provision, there will be variances in the impairments
allowances required under the two methodologies. Similarly, interest on non-performing loans are suspended
as per NBE directive, while IFRS 9 prescribes to recognize stage 3 loans interest income net of impairement
losses.  
The proclamation ‘Financial Reporting Proclamation No.847/2014 stipulates that Banks would be required to
make provisions for financial assets as prescribed in the relevant IFRS Standards when IFRS is adopted.
However, Banks would be required to comply with the following:
(a) Provisions for loans & advances and other assets are recognised in the income statement based on the
requirements of IFRS. However, the IFRS provision should be compared with provisions determined under the
NBE Directives and the expected impact/changes in other reserves are treated as follows:
• Prudential provisions is greater than IFRS provisions; the excess resulting should be transferred from the
general reserve (retained earnings) account to a “regulatory risk reserve”.
• Interest suspended in the previous years and regularized in the current year is compared with current year
stage 3 loans interest income recognized net of impairment losses. The difference between the two is
transferred to “regulatory risk reserve”.
• Prudential provisions is less than IFRS provisions; IFRS determined provision is charged to the statement of
comprehensive income. The cumulative balance in the regulatory risk reserve is thereafter reversed to the
general reserve account.
