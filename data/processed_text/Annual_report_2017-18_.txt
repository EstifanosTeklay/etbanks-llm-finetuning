Honorable Shareholders! 
I feel great pleasure and honor to present the Board 
of Directors’ Report along with the “Audited Financial 
Statements” on behalf of the Board of Directors and 
myself to the 22nd Ordinary Annual General Meeting 
of the Shareholders of the Bank for 2017/18 Fiscal 
Year. 
As we know, the reporting year has seen both 
opportunities and challenges in general. The world 
economy has continued its expansionary trend 
during the 2017/18 Fiscal Year. According to World 
Economic Outlook Report of the International 
Monetary Fund published in July 2018, global 
growth is strengthening. As a result, despite policy 
uncertainty, global growth is projected to rise to 3.9 
percent in 2018 and 2019 from a post-crisis low level 
of 2.4 percent in 2016.
Activities in advanced economies are also expected 
to gain momentum in 2018 and 2019. Besides, in 
the Euro Zone and Japan, growth forecasts have got 
improved, thus reflecting strengthening domestic 
demand and exports.

ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18
As to the growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, it is projected to recover to 3.4 percent in 2018 from 
the sharp decline to 1.3 percent in 2016, and even to further strengthen to 3.8 percent in 
2019 due to the rising commodity prices and improvements to macroeconomic imbalances. 
Similarly, Ethiopia’s economy has kept on performing well. According to the National Planning 
Commission, in 2017/18 the country’s economic growth stood at 9.5 percent. Economic 
expansion in the country, however, is largely driven by public investments.
Given the recent political developments together with the contribution of FDI and the growth 
in the private sector; the country is expected to maintain its position in the coming few years 
among the fastest and highest growth rate forecasted for any African country, followed by 
Tanzania and Ivory Coast.
With regard to the demand side, GDP at current market price indicated a growth by 18 
percent and reached Birr 1.8 trillion in 2016/17. This has brought about an increase in GDP 
per capita from USD 794 in 2015/16 to USD 863 in 2016/17. In 2016/17, the gross domestic 
saving reached 24.1 percent and also estimated to be 29.6 percent in 2018/19.
The period under review was a challenging year for banking sector that multi-faceted and 
stringent regulatory requirements, which have an immediate and prolonged direct impact on 
the performance of commercial banks have been endorsed by National Bank of Ethiopia. The 
complementary requirements, which seriously affected the bottom line of banks following 
the third official devaluation of Birr against US Dollar were upward revision of the minimum 
saving and time deposit rate from 5 percent to 7 percent, surrender of 30 percent of foreign 
exchange inflow to NBE every month, retaining 30 percent of foreign exchange in retention 
account for indefinite period of time earning and setting credit ceiling on the non-export 
non-manufacturing sector. 
However, despite those challenges observed during the FY 2017/18, the financial sector 
which comprises mainly banking and insurance institutions was stable, growing rapidly both 
in terms of size and number of services. The sector has also continued to tap into new 
opportunities of mobilizing savings through expansion of branch networks and introduction 
of digital channels as well as new financial instruments.
Accordingly, BoA had managed to register better asset and profit growth. The total asset 
and capital level reached Birr 31.98 billion and Birr 4.25 billion as at June 30, 2018, 
exhibiting a growth of 23.57 percent and 27.11 percent, respectively as compared to that 
of the preceding year. Its total deposit balance also reached Birr 25.79 billion growing by 24 
percent over the figure registered last year. 
Similarly, during the reviewed period, the total outstanding loans and advances of the Bank, 
before provision for doubtful loans and advances, stood at Birr 17.99 billion, showing a 28.25 
percent rise over the previous year’s balance. In addition, the Bank secured a total income of 
Birr 3.27 billion, but incurred a total expense of Birr 2.51 billion. As a result, the gross profit 
before tax and after provision became Birr 765.71 million surpassing that of the preceding 
fiscal year by Birr 88.89 million or 13.13 percent.
Regarding construction works being executed by the Bank, during the period under review, 
the construction of the 2B+G+7 building underway at Belay Zeleke Road has already been 
11
finalized and the branch office has commenced delivering services. The relocation of some 
departments and West District of the Bank to this building is also well in progress. In 
addition, the first phase construction work for the B+G+6 building being erected in Hawassa 
town has been completed and the contract for the second phase has been signed. On top 
of these, the Bank concluded contract agreement to carry out the construction of a G+5 
building in Jimma town and also floated a bid to execute the construction of 3B+G+18 
building here in Addis Ababa near Mexico Square.
Honorable Shareholders! 
Bank of Abyssinia has been operating in a rapidly changing banking environment, i.e 
changing customers’ expectations and behaviors, tightening regulatory requirements, 
stiff competition and varying demographic and economic situations, among others. These 
challenges compelled BoA to introduce change in the overall ways of doing business which is 
capable of fully addressing those challenges. 
To this end, the Bank has designed and put in practice a five-year strategic and 
organizational transformation plan, which incorporates a number of strategic initiatives that 
have been classified under customer services, information technology, human capital and 
internal processes in order to become a major force in the market and stand out in the 
forefront in the banking industry. Following this, the Bank has attained better outcomes 
during the first two years of the strategy implementation period. During the third year, 
however, there had been some hurdles in the strides towards achieving the strategic goals of 
the Bank. These include, slow growth and temporary decline in the market shares of deposit 
loans and forex mobilized.  
Therefore, in order to fully achieve its financial objectives set out at the beginning of its 
five-year strategic plan period, the Bank needs to exert extra effort in the remaining two 
years of the strategic period. In this regard, the Bank calls up on due support from all its 
stakeholders including its customers, shareholders and the regulatory body.
However, it should be understood that the outcomes achieved so far could not have been 
attained without the encouragement of all stakeholders, support of Board of Directors, 
leadership of the Management and unstinted efforts of the whole staff of the Bank. 
Finally, on behalf of the Board of Directors and myself, I would like to seize this opportunity 
to express my gratitude and admiration to the National Bank of Ethiopia for its unreserved 
guidance, our shareholders for many years of patience and trust, our esteemed customers 
for their confidence and trust on our Bank. 
My most sincere thanks also go to my fellow members of the Board of Directors, Executive 
Management and employees of BoA for their unwavering dedication and commitment that 
has helped to realize this notable accomplishment under all these inconvenient situations.
Thank you all!

STATEMENT
of the Chief  
Executive Officer
Dear Honorable Shareholders!
On behalf of the Management of Bank of Abyssinia 
S.C (BoA) and on my own behalf, I am honored 
to present the Performance Report of the Bank of 
Abyssinia S.C for 2017/18 FY that ended on June 30, 
2018. 
The fiscal year had been a period in which the Bank 
had invested its precious time, resources and energy 
to achieve sustainable growth, customer centricity 
and operational efficiency. As a result, the Bank 
attained growth in major performance parameters. 
When we look at world economy, it has gained 
recovery and continued its expansionary trend. 
According to the world economic outlook report 
published in July 2018, the world economy is also 
expected to gain momentum in 2018 and 2019 
despite policy uncertainty. 
Regarding Ethiopian economy, despite the political 
instability witnessed in different parts of the country 
in the first half of the year; it has kept on performing

አቢሲንያ ባንክ
13
well. According to IMF, in 2017/18 the country’s economic growth has got improved to 9% 
from 8.5% registered last fiscal year. 
Given the recent political developments together with the contribution of FDI and the 
growth in the private sector; the country is expected to maintain its position in the coming 
few years among the fastest and highest growth rate forecasted for any African country, 
followed by Tanzania and Ivory Coast.
As to the banking sector, the year under review was very tough that multi-faceted 
and stringent regulatory requirements, which seriously affected the performance of 
commercial banks, have been endorsed by National Bank of Ethiopia. The complementary 
requirements, which have a direct impact on the bottom line of banks following the 
third official devaluation of Birr against Dollar include upward revision of the minimum 
saving and time deposit rate from 5 percent to 7 percent, surrender of 30 percent of 
foreign exchange inflow to NBE every month, retaining 30 percent of foreign exchange 
in retention account for indefinite period of time earning and setting credit ceiling on the 
non-export non-manufacturing sector. 
In spite of the aforementioned unexpected and uncontrollable challenges, during the FY 
2017/18, the financial sector which comprises mainly banking and insurance institutions 
was stable, growing rapidly both in terms of size and number of services. The sector has 
also continued to tap into new opportunities of mobilizing savings through expansion of 
branch networks and introduction of digital channels as well as new financial instruments.
Despite a number of other external challenges in addition to regulatory requirements, BoA 
managed to register a total asset and capital level of Birr 31.98 billion and Birr 4.24 billion 
as at June 30, 2018, exhibiting a growth of 23.57 percent and 27.11 percent, respectively 
as compared to that of the preceding year. 
Similarly, the Bank earned a total income of Birr 3.27 billion at the end of June 2018, 
which was higher than that of the last year same month by 0.89 billion or 37.78 percent.
But in order to secure such amount of total income, the Bank incurred a total expense of 
Birr 2.51 billion. 
During the just-ended fiscal year, the total deposit balance of the Bank reached Birr 25.79 
billion which surpassed that of last year same period by Birr 5 billion or 24 percent.
The total outstanding loans and advances of the Bank stood at Birr 17.99 billion, indicating 
a 28.25 percent rise as compared to the previous year’s balance. Concerning loan quality; 
special efforts exerted on loan collection assisted the Bank to bring down the level of Non-
Performing Loans (NPLs) below 1.3 percent.
As an outcome of the strategic plan, the Bank has been aggressively expanding its branch 
networks and deployment of alternative channels. To this end, during the review period; 
the Bank lifted up the total number of branches to 286 by opening 53 new branches 
BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C 
14
ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18
and sub-branches. It has also expanded other alternative service delivery channels by 
installing 118 ATMs as well as placing 278 POS machines at merchant sites. As a result, 
the total number of account holders, number of cardholders and mobile banking users 
reached 1,012,177; 243,215 and 213,973, respectively.
On the other hand, in 2017/18 FY the Bank’s accomplishment with regard to the 
execution of major projects was so successful. Accordingly, the implementation of Data 
Center project initiative along with a number of auxiliary systems such as corporate 
email, collaboration suite and new service desk system were finalized on time and within 
the earmarked budget and went operational. Besides, it was the year in which Internet 
Banking and Interest Free Banking services and acquiring of Visa Card on ATM and POS 
machines were launched.  
Furthermore, during the stated period, the Bank has launched three new products; 
namely Senior Citizens’ (Balewiletawoch) Saving Account, Women’s (Aday) Saving 
Account and Youth (Afla) Saving Account, which were recommended in the business 
model and are expected to meet the needs and expectations of three retail segments 
of customers. As a result, the Bank has been able to mobilize substantial amount of 
deposit through these newly introduced customized products.
Respected Shareholders! 
I fell honored to declare that in 2017/18 fiscal year, BoA recorded a gross profit before 
tax and after provision of Birr 765.71 million, which exceeded that of the last year same 
period by Birr 88.89 million or 13.13 percent.
Finally, on behalf of the Executive Management, dedicated staff of the Bank and myself, 
I would like to extend my earnest admiration to NBE for all its guidance and assistance; 
the Bank’s honored customers, shareholders and others stakeholders for their conviction 
and confidence in our Bank’s strides; and all employees for their unreserved effort to 
materialize BoA’s aspirations during the review period. 
As a final note, members of the Board of Directors also deserve special gratitude for the 
commendable effort they have exerted towards assisting the Management within the 
scope of their duties and responsibilities.
Thank you!

from the preceding year similar period and reached 
Birr 25.79 billion as at 30 June 2018.

expenses were among the major components of 
the total expense, accounting for 42.11%, 34.39%

aggressive branch expansion.

3.3 Business Development 
During the just-ended fiscal year, BoA had fully 
implemented the relationship ecosystem which 
helps to enhance the business development of 
the Bank. With this ecosystem, the Bank assigned 
dedicated front line personnel who interact with 
different customers based on their segment specific 
needs. These dedicated personnel, i.e. relationship 
managers, account managers and sales personnel 
would assist the Bank to deliver personalized 
services that meet the needs and expectations of 
specific target groups of customers. Furthermore, 
they play key role in the business development by 
acquiring of thousands of new customers, retaining 
the existing ones and thus mobilized substantial 
amount of deposit during the just-ended fiscal year. 
In order to take advantage of business 
opportunities, the Bank has undertaken wide 
ranging marketing activities. Accordingly, three 
different types of new products, namely Senior 
Citizens’ (Balewiletawoch) Saving Account, Women’s 
(Aday) Saving Account and Youth (Afla) Saving 
Account, which were recommended in the business 
model and expected to meet the needs and 
expectations of three retail segment of customers

Free Banking services to its esteemed customers. 
Accordingly, huge amount of deposit was collected 
through these newly introduced customized 
products and Interest Free Banking services.

During the stated period, the Bank had continued 
working with eight Money Transfer Companies, 
which helped to mobilize foreign currency from 
international remittances. It has also forged similar 
new business ties with two additional reputable 
Money Transfer Companies known as World Remit 
and First Global Data Corp. In addition, the Bank 
has finalized the implementation phase and began 
acquiring of Visa International Card on ATM and 
PoS machines in order to boost the amount of 
foreign currency obtained from E-Banking products.

and promotional works via a number of electronics 
and print media and sponsoring different TV and

general public.
3.4 Information Systems 
As part of the strategy, the Bank has given special 
attention to technology adoption and leveraging in 
order to build its competitive advantage and step 
up delivery of products and services to its customer. 
To this end, the implementation of Data Center 
project initiative along with a number of auxiliary 
systems such as corporate email, collaboration suite 
and new service desk system was finalized on time 
and within the allotted budget. In addition, the 
upgrading of the core banking system with latest 
version, which enables the Bank to cater convenient 
and efficient services to its honored customers is 
well underway and is expected to be finalized as 
per the time table.
Furthermore, to achieve system availability at 
all times, the Bank has fully accomplished the 
network enhancement project initiative before the 
end of June 30, 2018. With this project initiative, 
uninterrupted network connections were provided 
to every branch, which enhances the system 
availability of branches at all times.

and mobile banking grew by 83% and 99%, 
respectively as compared to last fiscal year. The

ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18
4. Adoption of IFRS
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
is a modern financial reporting system, which 
constitutes standards, interpretations and the 
framework for the preparation and presentation 
of financial statements set and adopted by the 
International Accounting Standards Board. The 
government of Ethiopia also passed the Financial 
Reporting Proclamation and Regulation in 2014 
for the establishment and determination of the 
procedure of the Accounting and Auditing Board 
of Ethiopia which is in charge of coordinating the 
implementing IFRS in the country. Accordingly, 
banks, insurance companies and public enterprises 
are ordered to comply with the International 
Financial Reporting System (IFRS) within the 
deadline set for 2018.  
In line with this, during the period under review; 
BoA established a Project Office responsible for the 
implementation of IFRS and launched the project.  
Though IFRS conversion has many challenges such 
as volatility and subjectivity 
to the financial statements 
due to the use of fair value 
accounting, difficulty to arrive at 
fair value and absence of expertise 
to provide valuation service; the Bank 
has managed to adopt the International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) ahead 
of the deadline. Seizing this opportunity, it is the 
Bank’s pleasure to present its financial statement in 
the annual report using IFRS.
5. Future Plan 
During the reviewed fiscal year, BoA had 
contributed its share for the macro-economic as 
well as sectoral development like in the previous 
periods by delivering banking services via 
conventional as well as alternative channels and 
playing key role as a financial intermediary, i.e. 
mobilizing deposit from customers and allocating 
those resources to sectors that are accorded 
high national priority. The Bank is also ready to 
discharge such responsibilities and key role in a 
better way in the upcoming fiscal year. 
To this end, the Bank has planned to invest 
more time and energy to strengthen the 
sustainable growth of resource mobilization and 
correspondingly allocation of its scarce resources 
(deposit and foreign currency) optimally in a 
way that they will bring multiple benefits to the 
Bank. To achieve the intended plan, the Bank 
will aggressively expand its branch networks by 
opening additional branches in more bankable 
23
areas during the FY 2018/19 in order to come 
closer to its customers and mobilize more deposit. 
In addition, the Bank will exert its utmost effort to 
boost its banking services accessibility through Card 
Banking, Mobile Banking, Internet Banking and 
Mobile Financial Inclusion. 
In the coming fiscal year, the Bank strives for its 
customers to have seamless experience as they 
do business at every stage of interaction point 
and make that interaction point delightful and 
memorable experience through simplicity, speedy 
customer service, and proactively responding to 
their needs and wants. The Bank will also focus on 
cost reduction through operational efficiency so as 
to mitigate the effect on profit margin of the Bank.
Regarding strategic initiatives, the Bank will also 
gear up all its efforts towards the successful 
implementation of all prioritized strategic initiatives. 
 
Because these strategic initiatives are expected 
to bring a positive outcome to the Bank’s overall 
business system and operating model, which 
would enable it to achieve its corporate strategy 
objectives. 
Therefore, the scrupulous implementation of those 
strategic initiatives demand the concerted efforts 
of all stakeholders of the Bank, i.e., the Board of 
Directors, Executive Management and all employees 
in order to materialize the envisioned targets and 
attain the Bank’s aspirations. 
6. Appropriation of Retained  
	
Earnings 
During the Fiscal Year 2017/18, the Bank secured a 
net profit of Birr 337.50 million after the appropriate 
deductions were made from the gross profit of the 
just-ended Fiscal Year.
The Board of Directors, therefore, recommends that 
Birr 336.60 million be distributed to shareholders, 
proportionate to their respective paid-up shares 
after deducting the share of the Board of Directors, 
which is Birr 900,000.
7. Vote of Thanks 
In the end, BoA’s Board of Directors and the 
Executive Management would like to seize this 
opportunity to express their gratitude to the high-
valued customers of the Bank, shareholders, 
employees and the regulatory body for their 
unreserved assistance towards helping the Bank to 
attain this outcome.

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
 
  
  
  
  
  
    
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also: 
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
·        Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting 
a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
  
  
  
·        Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Bank's internal control.  
 
  
 
·        Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by the management. 
 
·        Conclude on the appropriateness of the management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting 
and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, then we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ 
report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a 
going concern.  
 
 
  
 
·        Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the 
disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation. 
 
  
 
·        Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the Bank or 
business activities within the Bank to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit. We remain solely responsible 
for our audit opinion. 
 
  
 
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.

1 General information 
 
 
Bank of Abyssinia ("the Bank") is a public owned share Company domiciled in Ethiopia. The Bank was 
established in (1996) in accordance with the licensing & supervision of banking business proclamation 
No.84/1994 (as amended by 592/2008) and the commercial code of Ethiopia of 1960.The bank opened 
branches throughout the country. The Bank's registered office is at: 
  
 
 
Legehar Building 
 
 
Gambia Street 
 
 
P.O Box 12947 
 
 
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia 
 
  
 
 
The Bank is principally engaged in the provision of diverse range of financial products and services to a 
wholesale, retail and SME clients base in Ethiopian Market. 
  
 
2 Summary of significant accounting policies 
 
 
 
2.1 Introduction to summary of significant accounting policies 
 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. 
 
 
 
2.2 Basis of preparation 
 
 
The financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2018 have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board ("IASB"). Additional information required by National regulations is included where appropriate.  
 
 
 
 
The financial statements comprise the statement of profit or loss statement and other comprehensive income, 
the statement of financial position, the statement of changes in equity, the statement of cash flows and the 
notes to the financial statements. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2018 are the first the Bank has prepared in accordance 
with IFRS. Refer to note 39 for information on how the Bank adopted IFRS. 
 
 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern principle under the 
historical cost concept, except for the following; 
 
•    Buildings under  property, plant and equipment  – measured at fair value as deemed cost 
•    assets held for sale – measured at fair value less cost of disposal, and 
•    defined benefit pension plans – plan assets measured at fair value. 
 
All values are rounded to the nearest thousands, except when otherwise indicated. The financial statements 
are presented in thousands of Ethiopian Birr (Birr' 000). 
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Bank’s 
accounting policies. Changes in assumptions may have a significant impact on the financial statements in the 
period the assumptions changed. Management believes that the underlying assumptions are appropriate and 
that the Bank's financial statements therefore present the financial position and results fairly. The areas 
involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are 
significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in Note 4.

2.2.1 
Going concern 
 
 
 
 
 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The management have no doubt that 
the Bank would remain in existence after 12 months. 
 
 
 
2.2.2 
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures 
 
 
 
 
New Standards, amendments, interpretations issued but not yet effective. 
 
 
 
 
 
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods 
beginning after 30 June 2018, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. None of 
these is expected to have a significant effect on the financial statements of the Bank, except the following set 
out below: 
 
 
 
 
IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments 
 
 
 
 
 
In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments that replaces IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9.  IFRS 9 retains but simplifies 
the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: 
amortised cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through Profit or loss.  
 
The basis of classification depends on the Bank's business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics 
of financial assets. Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit 
or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in OCI not recycling. There is 
now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For 
financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of 
changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit 
or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge 
effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument 
and for the ‘hedged ratio’ to be the same as the one management actually use for risk management purposes. 
Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39.  
 
The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and early adoption is 
permitted. The Bank is yet to assess IFRS 9's full impact. 
 
IFRS 15 - Revenue from contracts with customers 
 
 
 
 
IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from 
contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration 
to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. 
 
This standard deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to 
users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows 
arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a 
good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. 
 
The standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction contracts’ and related interpretations. The 
standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier application is 
permitted. The Bank is yet to fully assess the expected impact on this standard.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2018
 
 
 
 
IFRS 16 - Leases 
 
 
 
 
This standard was issued in January 2016 (Effective 1 January 2019) . It sets out the principles for the 
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. The objective is to ensure that lessees and 
lessors provide relevant information in a manner that faithfully represents those transactions. The standard 
introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all 
leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. A lessee is required to 
recognise a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability 
representing its obligation to make lease payments. it also substantially carries forward the lessor accounting 
requirements in IAS 17.  The Bank is yet to fully assess the expected impact of this standard. 
 
Amendment to IAS 40 - Transfers of Investment Property  
 
The amendments clarify that transfers to, or from, investment property can only be made if there has been a 
change in use that is supported by evidence. A change in use occurs when the property meets, or ceases to 
meet, the definition of investment property. A change in intention alone is not sufficient to support a transfer. 
The list of evidence for a change of use in the standard was re-characterised as a non-exhaustive list of 
examples to help illustrate the principle. 
 
The Board provided two option for transition: 
- prospectively, with any impact from the reclassification recognised as adjustment to opening retained 
earnings as at the date of initial recognition, or 
- retrospectively - only permitted without the use of hindsight. 
 
Additional disclosures are required if an entity adopts the requirements prospectively. The effective date for 
the amendment is 1 January 2018. 
 
Amendment to IFRS 12 - Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 
 
The amendments clarify that the disclosure requirements in IFRS 12, other than those in paragraphs B10–
B16, apply to an entity’s interest in a subsidiary, a joint venture or an associate (or a portion of its interest in 
a joint venture or an associate) that is classified (or included in a disposal group that is classified) as held for 
sale. 
The amendments are effective from 1 January 2017 and must be applied retrospectively. 
 
 
 
 
IFRIC Interpretation 22 - Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration 
 
The interpretation clarifies that in determining the spot exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the 
related asset, expense or income (or part of it) on the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or non-
monetary liability relating to advance consideration, the date of the transaction is the date on which an entity 
initially recognises the nonmonetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the advance consideration. If 
there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, then the entity must determine a date of the transactions 
for each payment or receipt of advance consideration. 
 
Entities may apply the amendments on a fully retrospective basis. Alternatively, an entity may apply the 
interpretation prospectively to all assets, expenses and income in its scope that are initially recognised on or 
after: 
(i) The beginning of the reporting period in which the entity first applies the interpretation or; 
(ii) The beginning of a prior reporting period presented as comparative information in the financial statements 
of the reporting period in which the entity first applies the interpretation.

2.3 
Foreign currency translation 
 
 
 
 
a) 
Functional and presentation currency 
 
 
Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Bank operates ('the functional currency'). The functional currency and presentation 
currency of the Bank is the Ethiopian Birr (Birr).  
 
 
 
b) 
Transactions and balances 
 
 
 
 
 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing 
at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign 
currency transactions and from the translation at exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in currencies other than the Bank's functional currency are recognised in profit or loss within 
other (loss)/income. Monetary items denominated in foreign currency are translated using the closing rate as 
at the reporting date. 
 
Changes in the fair value of monetary securities denominated in foreign currency classified as available for 
sale are analysed between translation differences resulting from changes in the amortised cost of the security 
and other changes in the carrying amount of the security. Translation differences related to changes in 
amortised cost are recognised in profit or loss, and other changes in carrying amount are recognised in other 
comprehensive income. 
 
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value 
through profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation 
differences on non-monetary financial assets measure at fair value, such as equities classified as available for 
sale, are included in other comprehensive income. 
2.4 
Recognition of income and expenses 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Bank and 
the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured 
at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of 
payment and excluding taxes or duty. 
 
The Bank, earns income from interest on  loans given for domestic trade and services, building and 
construction, manufacturing, agriculture and personal loans. Other incomes includes margins on letter of 
credits and performance guarantees. 
 
 
 
2.4.1 
Interest and similar income and expense 
 
 
 
 
For all the government bills measured at amortised cost and interest bearing financial assets classified as 
available– for–sale interest income or expense is recorded using the Effective Interest rate (EIR), which is the 
rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the 
financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset 
or financial liability. The calculation takes into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for 
example, prepayment options) and includes any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the 
instrument and are an integral part of the Effective Interest Rate (EIR), but not future credit losses.The 
carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability is adjusted if the Bank revises its estimates of 
payments or receipts. The adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the original EIR and the change in 
carrying amount is recorded as 'Interest and similar income' for financial assets and Interest and similar 
expense for financial liabilities. 
 
Once the recorded value of a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been reduced due to an 
impairment loss, interest income continues to be recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the 
future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.

2.4.2 
Fees and commission 
 
 
 
 
 
Fees and commission income and expenses that are integral to the effective interest rate on a financial asset - 
government bills or liability are included in the measurement of the effective interest rate. Other fees and 
commission income; money transfer, letter of credit, payment orders, uncleared effects, ATM and POS 
transactions etc are recognised as the related services are performed. 
 
When a loan commitment is not expected to result in the draw-down of a loan, loan commitment fees are 
recognised on a straight-line basis over the commitment period. 
 
Other fees and commission expenses relates mainly to transaction and service fees are expensed as the 
services are received. 
 
 
 
2.4.3 
Dividend income 
 
 
 
 
 
This is recognised when the Bank’s right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when the 
shareholders approve and declare the dividend. 
2.4.4 
Foreign exchange revaluation gains or losses 
 
 
 
 
These are gains and losses arising on settlement and translation of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the functional currency’s spot rate of exchange at the reporting date.  
This amount is recognised in the income statement and it is further broken down into realised and unrealised 
portion.   
 
The monetary assets and liabilities include financial assets within the foreign currencies deposits received and 
held on behalf of third parties etc.    
2.5 
Financial instruments - initial recognition and subsequent measurement 
 
 
 
 
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity. 
 
 
 
 
2.5.1 
Financial assets 
 
 
 
 
 
Initial recognition and measurement 
 
 
 
 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair 
value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. 
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by 
regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the 
date that the Bank commits to purchase or sell the asset. 
 
Subsequent measurement  
 
 
 
 
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified into the following categories: 
• Loans and receivables 
• Available-for-sale financial investments 
a) 
Loans and receivables 
 
 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not 
quoted in an active market. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method, less impairment.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2018
 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs 
that are an integral part of the EIR. 
 
 
 
 
The EIR amortisation is included in interest and similar income in income statement. The losses arising from 
impairment are recognised in income statement in loan impairment charge. 
 
The Bank’s loans and receivables comprise of cash and balances with other banks , Loans and advances to 
customers,  investments in NBE Bills , other assets and  Staff loans.  
b) 
Available-for-sale (AFS) financial assets 
 
AFS investments include equity securities. Equity investments classified as AFS are those which are neither 
classified as held–for–trading nor designated at fair value through profit or loss. Debt securities in this 
category are those which are intended to be held for an indefinite period of time and which may be sold in 
response to needs for liquidity or in response to changes in the market conditions.  
 
After initial measurement, AFS financial investments are subsequently measured at fair value with unrealised 
gains or losses recognised in OCI and credited in the AFS reserve until the investment is derecognised, at 
which time the cumulative gain or loss is recognised in other operating income, or the investment is 
determined to be impaired, when the cumulative loss is reclassified from the AFS reserve to income statement 
in impairment loss on financial investment. Interest earned whilst holding AFS financial investments is 
reported as interest and similar income using the EIR method. Unquoted equity securities whose fair value 
cannot be reliably measured are carried at cost. All other available-for-sale investments are carried at fair 
value. 
 
'Day 1' profit or loss 
 
 
 
 
 
When the transaction price differs from the fair value of other observable current market transactions in the 
same instrument or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable 
markets, the Bank immediately recognises the difference between the transaction price and fair value (a ‘Day 
1’ profit or loss) in ‘Other operating income’. In cases where fair value is determined using data which is not 
observable, the difference between the transaction price and model value is only recognised in the profit or 
loss when the inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised. 
 
Reclassification of financial assets 
 
 
 
 
 
Reclassification is at the election of management, and is determined on an instrument by instrument basis. 
The Bank does not reclassify any financial instrument into the fair value through profit or loss category after 
initial recognition.For a financial asset reclassified out of the ’Available–for–sale’ category, any previous gain 
or loss on that asset that has been recognised in equity is amortised to income statement over the remaining 
life of the investment using the EIR. Any difference between the new amortised cost and the expected cash 
flows is also amortised over the remaining life of the asset using the EIR. If the asset is subsequently 
determined to be impaired then the amount recorded in equity is reclassified to income statement. 
 
The Bank may reclassify a non–derivative trading asset out of the ‘held–for–trading’ category and into the 
‘loans and receivables’ category if it meets the definition of loans and receivables and the Bank has the 
intention and ability to hold the financial asset for the foreseeable future or until maturity. If a financial asset 
is reclassified, and if the Bank subsequently increases its estimates of future cash receipts as a result of 
increased recoverability of those cash receipts, the effect of that increase is recognised as an adjustment to 
the EIR from the date of the change in estimate. 
 
Derecognition of financial assets 
 
 
 
 
 
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) 
is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Bank’s statement of financial position) when

•  the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or 
•  the Bank has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay 
the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass–through’ arrangement; and 
either 
 
    (a) the Bank has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or 
    (b) the Bank has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but 
has transferred control of the asset. 
 
When the Bank has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-
through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. 
When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor 
transferred control of the asset, the Bank continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the 
Bank’s continuing involvement. In that case, the Bank also recognises an associated liability. The transferred 
asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Bank 
has retained. 
 
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the 
lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Bank 
could be required to repay. 
 
Impairment of financial assets 
 
 
 
 
 
The Bank assesses at each reporting date, whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a 
group of financial assets is impaired. An impairment exists if one or more events that has occurred since the 
initial recognition of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’), has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of 
the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. Evidence of impairment may 
include indications that the borrower or a group of borrowers is experiencing significant financial difficulty, the 
probability that they will enter Bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, default or delinquency in interest 
or principal payments and where observable data indicates that there is measurable decrease in the estimated 
future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. 
(i) 
Financial assets carried at amortised cost 
 
 
 
 
For financial assets carried at amortised cost (such as loans and receivables), the Bank first assesses 
individually whether objective evidence of impairment exists for financial assets that are individually 
significant, or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If the Bank determines that 
no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, it includes the asset in 
a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for 
impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is, or 
continues to be, recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. 
 
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured 
as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows 
(excluding future expected credit losses that have not yet been incurred).                                                                            
The interest income is recorded as part of ‘Interest and similar income’. Loans together with the associated 
allowance are written off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery and all collateral has been 
realised or has been transferred to the Bank. If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated 
impairment loss increases or decreases because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, 
the previously recognised impairment loss is increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance account. If a 
future write–off is later recovered, the recovery is credited to the ’loan impairment charge’. 
The present value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial asset’s original EIR. If a 
loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current EIR. 
 
The calculation of the present value of the estimated future cash flows of a collateralised financial asset 
reflects the cash flows that may result from foreclosure less costs for obtaining and selling the collateral, 
whether or not foreclosure is probable.

ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18
BANK OF ABYSSINIA
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2018
 
 
 
 
 
For the purpose of a collective evaluation of impairment, financial assets are grouped on the basis of the 
Bank’s internal credit grading system, that considers credit risk characteristics such as asset type, industry, 
geographical location, collateral type, past–due status and other relevant factors. 
 
Future cash flows on a group of financial assets that are collectively evaluated for impairment are estimated 
on the basis of historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics similar to those in the Bank.  
 
Historical loss experience is adjusted on the basis of current observable data to reflect the effects of current 
conditions on which the historical loss experience is based and to remove the effects of conditions in the 
historical period that do not exist currently. Estimates of changes in future cash flows reflect, and are 
directionally consistent with, changes in related observable data from year to year (such as changes in 
unemployment rates, property prices, commodity prices, payment status, or other factors that are indicative 
of incurred losses in the Bank and their magnitude). The methodology and assumptions used for estimating 
future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss 
experience. 
 
 
 
(ii) 
Available-for-sale (AFS) financial instruments 
 
Available-for-sale financial assets are impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment, resulting from one 
or more loss events that occurred after initial recognition but before the reporting date, that have an impact 
on the future cash flows of the asset.  
 
In addition, an available-for-sale equity instrument is generally considered impaired if a significant or 
prolonged decline in the fair value of the instrument below its cost has occurred. Where an available-for-sale 
asset, which has been remeasured to fair value directly through equity, is impaired, the impairment loss is 
recognised in profit or loss. 
 
If any loss on the financial asset was previously recognised directly in equity as a reduction in fair value, the 
cumulative net loss that had been recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss and is recognised as part 
of the impairment loss. The amount of the loss recognised in profit or loss is the difference between the 
acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any previously recognised impairment loss. 
 
If, in a subsequent period, the amount relating to an impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be 
linked objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, where the instrument is a 
debt instrument, the impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss. An impairment loss in respect of an 
equity instrument classified as available-for-sale is not reversed through profit or loss but accounted for 
directly in equity. 
 
Renegotiated loans 
 
 
 
 
 
Where possible, the Bank seeks to restructure loans rather than to take possession of collateral. This may 
involve extending the payment arrangements and the agreement of new loan conditions. Once the terms have 
been renegotiated any impairment is measured using the original EIR as calculated before the modification of 
terms and the loan is no longer considered past due. Management continually reviews renegotiated loans to 
ensure that all criteria are met and that future payments are likely to occur. The loans continue to be subject 
to an individual or collective impairment assessment, calculated using the loan’s original EIR. 
 
Collateral valuation 
 
 
 
 
 
The Bank seeks to use collateral, where possible, to mitigate its risks on financial assets. The collateral comes 
in various forms such as cash via Bank guarantees and real estate. The fair value of collateral is generally 
assessed, at a minimum, at inception and based on the Bank's reporting schedule. 
 
To the extent possible, the Bank uses comparative market data for valuing financial assets, held as collateral. 
Other financial assets which do not have a readily determinable market value are valued using models.

Collateral repossessed 
 
 
 
 
 
Repossessed collateral represents financial and non-financial assets acquired by the Bank in settlement of 
overdue loans. The Bank’s policy is to determine whether a repossessed asset is best used for its internal 
operations or should be sold. Assets determined to be used for internal operations are  initially recognised at 
the lower of their repossessed value or the carrying value of the original secured asset and included in the 
relevant assets depending on the nature and the Bank’s intention in respect of recovery of these assets, and 
are subsequently remeasured and accounted for in accordance with the accounting policies for these 
categories of assets. Assets that are determined better to be sold are immediately transferred to assets held 
for sale at their fair value at the repossession date in line with the Bank’s policy. 
2.5.2 
Financial liabilities 
 
 
 
 
 
Initial recognition and measurement 
 
 
 
 
Financial liabilities are classified at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
and other financial liabilities. 
 
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of other financial liabilities, net of 
directly attributable transaction costs. 
 
The Bank's financial liabilities include deposits from customers and domestic banks, other liabilities and 
borrowings. Interest expenditure is recognised in interest and similar expense. 
 
Subsequent measurement 
 
 
 
 
 
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: 
 
 
 
 
Financial liabilities at amortised cost 
 
 
 
 
 
Financial instruments issued by the Bank, that are not designated at fair value through profit or loss but are 
classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost, where the substance of the contractual arrangement results 
in the Bank having an obligation either to deliver cash or another financial asset to the holder, or to satisfy the 
obligation other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number 
of own equity shares.  
 
After initial measurement, financial liabilities at amortised cost are subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
 
The Bank’s financial liabilities carried at amortised cost comprise of customer deposits, margin held on letter 
of credit, dividend payable, long term deposits, cashiers payment order, advance payment on loan and 
borrowings.  
 
Derecognition of financial liabilities 
 
 
 
 
 
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they have been redeemed or otherwise extinguished. 
 
 
 
2.5.3 
Offsetting financial instruments 
 
 
 
 
 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position 
where The Bank has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The Bank has also entered into 
arrangements that do not meet the criteria for offsetting but still allow for the related amounts to be set off in 
certain circumstances, such as Bankruptcy or the termination of a contract.

Cash and cash equivalents 
 
 
 
 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise balances with less than three months’ maturity from the date of 
acquisition, including cash in hand, deposits held at call with Banks and other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less. 
 
 
 
2.7 
Property, plant and Equipment 
 
 
 
 
 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment if the 
recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be 
replaced at intervals, the Bank recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and 
depreciates them accordingly. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in income statement as 
incurred. 
 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the 
group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is 
derecognised. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost  to their residual values over 
their estimated useful lives, as follows: 
 
 
 
Asset class

The Bank commences depreciation when the asset is available for use. Land is not depreciated. 
 
 
 
 
Capital work-in-progress is not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use.  They are disclosed 
when reclassified during the year. 
 
 
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use disposal. Any gain or loss arising on 
derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset) is included in income statement when the asset is derecognised. 
 
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed 
at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.8 
Intangible assets 
 
 
 
 
 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if 
any. Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the 
related expenditure is reflected in income statement in the period in which the expenditure is incurred. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
21
BANK OF ABYSSINIA
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2018
 
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite 
lives are amortised over the useful economic life. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an 
intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Changes in the 
expected useful life, or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the 
asset, are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or methodology, as appropriate, which are then 
treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expenses on intangible assets with finite lives is 
presented as a separate line item in the income statement. 
 
Amortisation is calculated using the straight–line method to write down the cost of intangible assets to their 
residual values over their estimated useful lives, which is 6 years. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.9 
Investment property 
 
 
 
 
 
Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, are classified as investment 
properties.  
 
Recognition of investment properties takes place only when it is probable that the future economic benefits 
that are associated with the investment property will flow to the Bank and the cost can be reliably measured.  
This is usually when all risks are transferred. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. The Bank has opted to 
subsequently carry investment property at cost and disclose fair value. Fair value is based on comparative 
market prices, adjusted if necessary, for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific 
asset. If this information is not available, the Bank uses alternative valuation methods, such as recent prices 
on less active markets or discounted cash flow projections. Valuations are performed as of the reporting date 
by professional valuers who hold recognised and relevant professional qualifications and have recent 
experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued. These valuations form the 
basis for the carrying amounts in the financial statements.  
 
 
 
The fair value of investment property reflects, the near current market conditions. 
 
 
 
Investment properties are derecognised when they have been disposed. Where the Bank disposes of a 
property at fair value in an arm’s length transaction, the carrying value immediately prior to the sale is 
adjusted to the transaction price, and the adjustment is recorded in the statement of changes in net assets 
available for benefit.    
 
 
 
 
 
2.10  
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and discontinued operations 
 
 
 
 
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be 
recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered 
highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, 
except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, financial assets and 
investment property that are carried at fair value and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which are 
specifically exempt from this requirement.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2018
 
An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to 
fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of 
an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A 
gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is 
recognised at the date of derecognition. 
 
Non-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortised while 
they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal 
group classified as held for sale continue to be recognised. 
 
Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are 
presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal group classified 
as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the balance sheet. 
 
A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for 
sale and that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a 
single co-ordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired 
exclusively with a view to resale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the 
statement of profit or loss. 
2.11 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
 
 
 
 
 
The Bank assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If 
any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Bank estimates the 
asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating 
unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an 
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from 
other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-
tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 
the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. 
If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are 
corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair 
value indicators. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Bank bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared 
separately for each of the Bank’s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and 
forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is 
calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. 
 
For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an 
indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication 
exists, the Bank estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss 
is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable 
amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of 
the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such 
reversal is recognised in the income statement. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.12 
Other assets 
 
 
Other assets are generally defined as claims held against other entities for the future receipt of money. The 
other assets in the Bank's financial statements include the following: 
 
 
 
 
(a) 
Prepayment 
 
 
 
 
 
Prepayments are payments made in advance for services to be enjoyed in future. The amount is initially 
capitalized in the reporting period in which the payment is made and subsequently amortised over the period 
in which the service is to be enjoyed.

(b) 
Other receivables 
 
 
 
 
 
Other receivables are recognised upon the occurrence of event or transaction as they arise and cancelled 
when payment is received. 
 
The Bank's other receivables are rent receivables and other receivables from debtors. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.13 
Fair value measurement 
 
 
 
 
 
The Bank measures financial instruments classified as available-for-sale at fair value at each statement of 
financial position date. Fair value related disclosures for financial instruments and non-financial assets that are 
measured at fair value or where fair values are disclosed are, summarised in the following notes: 
 
•   Disclosures for valuation methods, significant estimates and assumptions Notes 3 and Note 4.7.1 
•   Quantitative disclosures of fair value measurement hierarchy Note 4.7.2 
•   Financial instruments (including those carried at amortised cost) Note 4.7.3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on 
the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: 
 
•   In the principal market for the asset or liability, or 
•   In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. 
 
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to by the Bank. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use 
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. 
 
The Bank uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data 
are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use 
of unobservable inputs. 
 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: 
• Level 1 —  Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
• Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable. 
• Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable. 
 
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Bank 
determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of 
each reporting period. 
 
The Bank’s management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement, 
such as available-for-sale financial assets. 
 
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Bank has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis 
of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as 
explained above.

(a) 
Defined contribution plan 
 
 
 
 
 
The Bank operates two defined contribution plans; 
 
i)   pension scheme in line with the provisions of Ethiopian pension of private organisation employees 
proclamation  715/2011.  Funding under the scheme is 7% and 11% by employees and the Bank respectively; 
ii)  provident fund contribution, funding under this scheme is 6% and 12% by employees and the Bank 
respectively; based on the employees' salary. Employer's contributions to this scheme are charged to profit or 
loss and other comprehensive income in the period in which they relate. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b) 
Defined benefit plan 
 
 
 
 
 
The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The 
defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit 
method. 
 
 
 
 
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the 
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan 
assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit 
credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated 
future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency 
in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related 
pension obligation. 
 
The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognised in the income statement in employee benefit 
expense, except where included in the cost of an asset, reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation 
resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes curtailments and settlements. 
 
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience 
adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive 
income in the period in which they arise. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(c ) 
Termination benefits 
 
 
 
 
 
Termination benefits are payable to bank employees and executive directors when employment is terminated 
by the Bank before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in 
exchange for these benefits. The Bank recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to 
either: terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without 
possibility of withdrawal; or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary 
redundancy. 
 
 
 
 
(d ) 
Profit-sharing and bonus plans 
 
 
 
 
 
The Banks recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing based on a formula that takes 
into consideration the profit attributable to the company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Bank 
recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a 
constructive obligation.

Provisions 
 
 
 
 
 
Provisions are recognised when the bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past 
event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Bank expects some 
or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is 
recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to 
a provision is presented in income statement net of any reimbursement. 
 
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that 
reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as other operating expenses. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.16  
Share capital 
 
 
 
 
 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options or to the acquisition of a business 
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
 
 
 
 
2.17  
Earnings per share 
 
 
 
 
 
The Bank presents basic earnings per share for its ordinary shares.  Basic earnings per share are calculated by 
dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Bank by the weighted average number 
of shares outstanding during the period. 
 
 
 
 
 
2.18 
Leases  
 
 
 
 
 
The determination of whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, is based on the substance of the 
arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the 
use of a specific asset or assets or whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. 
 
 
 
Bank as a lessee 
 
 
 
 
 
Leases that do not transfer to the Bank substantially all of the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the 
leased items are operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rental payable is recognised as an expense 
in the period in which they it is incurred. 
 
 
 
Bank as a lessor 
 
 
 
 
 
Leases where the Bank does not transfer substantially all of the risk and benefits of ownership of the asset 
are classified as operating leases. Rental income is recorded as earned based on the contractual terms of the 
lease in Other operating income. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating operating leases are added to the 
carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. 
Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned. 
 
 
 
 
2.19 
Income taxation 
 
 
 
 
(a) 
Current income tax 
 
 
 
 
 
The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income 
based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and 
liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses. 
 
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at 
the end of the reporting period in Ethiopia. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns 
with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes 
provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

(b) 
Deferred tax 
 
 
 
 
 
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they 
arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. 
 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred 
tax liability is settled. 
 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be 
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where 
there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when they arise in the same tax reporting group and where 
there is both the legal right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions 
 
 
 
 
The preparation of the Bank’s financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the 
accompanying disclosures, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these 
assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying 
amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods. 
 
Other disclosures relating to the Bank’s exposure to risks and uncertainties includes: 
• Capital management Note 4.6 
• Financial risk management and policies Note 4.1 
• Sensitivity analyses disclosures Note 4.5.2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.1 
Judgements 
 
  
  
 
In the process of applying the Bank’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, 
which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements: 
 
 
Operating lease commitments - Bank as lessee 
 
 
 
 
The Bank has entered into commercial property leases. The Bank has determined, based on an evaluation of 
the terms and conditions of the arrangements, such as the lease term not constituting a substantial portion of 
the economic life of the commercial property, that it does not retain all the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership of these properties and accounts for the contracts as operating leases. 
 
 
 
3.2 
Estimates and assumptions 
 
 
 
 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation at the reporting date, that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year, are described below. The Bank based its assumptions and estimates on parameters 
available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future 
developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances beyond the control of the 
Bank. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur. 
 
 
 
 
 
27
 
 
Impairment losses on loans and advances to customers 
 
  
  
 
The Bank reviews its loan portfolios for impairment on an on-going basis. The Bank first assesses whether 
objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and 
individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. Impairment provisions are 
also recognised for losses not specifically identified but which, experience and observable data indicate, are 
present in the portfolio at the date of assessment. For individually significant financial assets that has been 
deemed to be impaired, management has deemed that cash flow from collateral obtained would arise within 6 
months where the financial asset is collaterised. 
 
Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and 
objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the portfolio, when scheduling its future cash flows. The 
methodology and assumptions used for estimating both the amount and timing of future cash flows are 
reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience. 
 
The use of historical loss experience is supplemented with significant management judgment to assess 
whether current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual level of inherent losses is likely to 
differ from that suggested by historical experience. In normal circumstances, historical experience provides 
objective and relevant information from which to assess inherent loss within each portfolio. In other 
circumstances, historical loss experience provides less relevant information about the inherent loss in a given 
portfolio at the balance sheet date, for example, where there have been changes in economic conditions such 
that the most recent trends in risk factors are not fully reflected in the historical information. In these 
circumstances, such risk factors are taken into account when calculating the appropriate levels of impairment 
allowances, by adjusting the impairment loss derived solely from historical loss experience. 
 
The detailed methodologies, areas of estimation and judgement applied in the calculation of the Bank's 
impairment charge on financial assets are set out in the Financial risk management section. 
 
The estimation of impairment losses is subject to uncertainty, which has increased in the current economic 
environment, and is highly sensitive to factors such as the level of economic activity, unemployment rates, 
property price trends, and interest rates. The assumptions underlying this judgement are highly subjective. 
The methodology and the assumptions used in calculating impairment losses are reviewed regularly in the 
light of differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fair value  measurement of financial instruments 
 
 
 
 
When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the statement of financial position 
cannot be  measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation 
techniques including the discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The inputs to these models are taken from 
observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in 
establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and 
volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial 
instruments. See Note 4.7.2 for further disclosures. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
Defined benefit plans 
 
 
 
 
The cost of the defined benefit pension plan, long service awards, gratuity scheme and post-employment 
medical benefits and the present value of these defined benefit obligations are determined using actuarial 
valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual 
developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases, 
mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-
term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions 
are reviewed at each reporting date.

Depreciation and carrying value of property, plant and equipment 
 
 
 
 
The estimation of the useful lives of assets is based on management’s judgement. Any material adjustment to 
the estimated useful lives of items of property and equipment will have an impact on the carrying value of 
these items. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
 
 
 
 
Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable 
amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The fair value less costs 
of disposal calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions, conducted at arm’s length, 
for similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in 
use calculation is based on a DCF model. The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years 
and do not include restructuring activities that the Bank is not yet committed to or significant future 
investments that will enhance the asset’s performance of the CGU being tested. The recoverable amount is 
sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash-
inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Taxes 
 
 
 
 
 
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the 
amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and 
the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the 
actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future 
adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. The amount of such provisions is based on various 
factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the 
taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. 
 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit 
will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to 
determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the 
level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Development cost  
 
 
 
 
 
The Bank capitalises development costs for a project in accordance with the accounting policy. Initial 
capitalisation of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and economic feasibility is 
confirmed, usually when a product development project has reached a defined milestone according to an 
established project management model. In determining the amounts to be capitalised, management makes 
assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, discount rates to be applied and 
the expected period of benefits. The development costs that were capitalised by the Bank relates to those 
arising from the development of computer software.

Financial risk management 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.1 
Introduction 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk is inherent in the Bank’s activities, but is managed through a process of ongoing identification, measurement 
and monitoring, subject to risk limits and other controls. This process of risk management is critical to the Bank’s 
continuing profitability and each individual within the Bank is accountable for the risk exposures relating to his or 
her responsibilities. The Bank is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. It is also subject to country 
risk and various operating risks. 
 
The independent risk control process does not include business risks such as changes in the environment, 
technology and industry. The Bank's policy is to monitor those business risks through the Bank’s strategic planning 
process. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.1.1 
Risk management structure 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Asset-Liability Management Committee, is responsible for the overall risk management approach and for 
approving the risk management strategies and principles. It also has the responsibility to monitor the overall risk 
process within the Bank. 
 
The Asset-Liability Management Committee has the overall responsibility for the development of the risk strategy 
and implementing principles, frameworks, policies and limits. It is also responsible for managing risk decisions and 
monitoring risk levels and reports on a monthly basis to the Board risk committee. 
 
The Credit Risk Management Committee is responsible for implementing and maintaining risk related procedures to 
ensure an independent control process is maintained. The unit works closely with the Management Risk Committee 
to ensure that procedures are compliant with the overall framework. 
 
 The Risk Management Unit is responsible for monitoring compliance with risk principles, policies and limits across 
the Bank. It carries out an assessment of risk on an ad hoc basis to monitor the Bank's independent control of 
risks, including monitoring the risk of exposures against limits and the assessment of risks of new products and 
structured transactions. This unit also ensures the complete capture of the risks in risk measurement and reporting 
systems. Exceptions are reported, where necessary, to the Risk Management Committee, and further to the Board 
Risk Committee and the relevant actions are taken to address exceptions and any areas of weakness. 
 
Bank Treasury operation is responsible for managing the Bank’s financial assets, financial liabilities and the overall 
financial structure. It is also primarily responsible for the funding and liquidity risks of the Bank. 
 
The Bank’s policy is that risk management processes throughout the Bank are audited annually by the Internal 
Audit function, which examines both the adequacy of the procedures and the Bank’s compliance with the 
procedures. Internal Audit Function discusses the results of all assessments with management, and reports its 
findings and recommendations to the Board Audit Committee. 
 
 
4.1.2 
Risk measurement and reporting systems 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Bank’s risks are measured using a method that reflects both the expected loss likely to arise in normal 
circumstances and unexpected losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss based on statistical models. 
The models make use of probabilities derived from historical experience, adjusted to reflect the economic 
environment. The Bank also runs worst-case scenarios that would arise in the event that extreme events which are 
unlikely to occur do, in fact, occur. 
 
Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily performed based on limits established by the Bank. These limits reflect 
the business strategy and market environment of the Bank as well as the level of risk that the Bank is willing to 
accept, with additional emphasis on selected regions. In addition, the Bank’s policy is to measure and monitor the 
overall risk bearing capacity in relation to the aggregate risk exposure across all risk types and activities.

Risk mitigation 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk controls and mitigants, identified and approved for the Bank, are documented for existing and new processes 
and systems. 
The adequacy of these mitigants is tested on a periodic basis through administration of control self-assessment 
questionnaires, using an operational risk management tool which requires risk owners to confirm the effectiveness 
of established controls. These are subsequently audited as part of the review process. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.2 
Financial instruments by category  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Bank's financial assets are classified into the following measurement categories: available-for-sale and loans 
and receivables and the financial liabilities are classified into other liabilities at amortised cost. 
 
Financial instruments are classified in the statement of financial position in accordance with their legal form and 
substance.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2018
4.3 
Credit risk 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Credit risk is the probability that a counterparty of the Bank will not meet its obligations in accordance with agreed 
terms and conditions which may lead to financial loss. The Bank is exposed to credit risk due to activities such as 
loans and advances, loan commitments arising from lending activities, credit enhancement provided such as 
financial guarantees and letter of credit. 
The Bank adopts a conservative approach to credit risk. Where appropriate, the Bank intervenes in the economy 
and provides guarantees in the financial system to prevent systemic risk.  
 
 
4.3.1 
Management of credit risk 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In measuring credit risk of loans and receivables to various counterparties, the Bank considers the character and 
capacity of the obligor to pay or meet contractual obligations, current exposures to the counter party/obligor and 
its likely future developments, credit history of the counterparty/obligor; and the likely recovery ratio in case of 
default obligations-value of collateral and other ways out. Our credit exposure comprises wholesale and retail loans 
and receivables which are developed to reflect the needs of our customers. The Bank’s policy is to lend principally 
on the basis of our customer’s repayment capacity through quantitative and qualitative evaluation. However we 
ensure that our loans are backed by collateral to reflect the risk of the obligors and the nature of the facility. 
 
In the estimation of credit risk, the Bank estimate the following parameters: 
 
 
(a) 
Probability of Default 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This is the probability that an obligor or counterparty will default over a given period, usually one year. This 
can be calculated on portfolio by portfolio basis or collectively depending on availability of historical data. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b) 
Loss Given Default 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Loss Given Default is defined as the portion of the loan determined to be irrecoverable at the time of loan 
default (1 – recovery rate). Our methods for estimating LGD includes both quantitative and qualitative 
factors. 
 
 
 
 
 
(c) 
Exposure at Default 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This represents the amount that is outstanding at the point of default. Its estimation includes the drawn 
amount and expected utilisation of the undrawn commitment at default. 
 
 
 
 
4.3.2 
Impairment assessment 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Bank assesses its impairment for the purpose of IFRS reporting using a two-way approach which are 
Individual assessment and portfolio assessment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) 
Individual assessment 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Bank reviewed and revised existing impairment triggers for each loan asset portfolio to ensure that a trigger 
identifies a loss event as early as possible, which would result in the earliest possible recognition of losses within 
the IFRS framework. The Bank then estimated the impairment based on the shortfall between the present value of 
estimated future cash flows and the asset carrying amount. 
 
 
(b) 
Collective assessment 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Loans and receivables that are not specifically impaired are assessed under collective impairment. For the purpose 
of collective impairment, financial assets are grouped on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics that are 
indicative of the debtors’ ability to pay all amounts due according to contractual terms. 
 
 
 
The Bank generally bases its analyses on historical experience. The collective assessment takes account of data 
from the loan portfolio (such as historical losses on the portfolio, levels of arrears, credit utilisation, loan to 
collateral ratios and expected receipts and recoveries once impaired) or economic data (such as current 
economic conditions, unemployment levels and local or industry–specific problems). 
 
 
 
 
The approximate delay between the time a loss is likely to have been incurred and the time it will be 
identified as requiring an individually assessed impairment allowance is also taken into consideration. The 
impairment allowance is reviewed by credit management to ensure alignment with the Bank’s overall policy.

The Bank holds collateral against loans and receivables to customers in the form of bank guarantees and

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2018
Individually impaired loans are loans that has well passed their recovery period. The counterparties are 
under liquidation. Individually impaired staff loans are loans given to staffs that are no longer staff of the 
Bank hence the recoverability of the loans is doubtful. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i) 
Loans and advances - neither past due nor impaired 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The credit quality of the portfolio of loans and receivables that were neither past due nor impaired can be 
assessed by reference to the customer's ability to pay based on loss experience.  Loans and receivables in 
this category are short term loans past due for less than 30 (thirty) loans and medium and long term loans 
past due for less than 180 (one hundred eighty) days.

Statement of Prudential adjustments 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Provisions under prudential guidelines are determined using the time based provisioning prescribed by the 
National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) Directives. This is at variance with the incurred loss model required by IFRS under 
IAS 39. As a result of the differences in the methodology/provision, there will be variances in the impairments 
allowances required under the two methodologies. 
 
The proclamation ‘Financial Reporting Proclamation No.847/2014 stipulates that Banks would be required to make 
provisions for loans as prescribed in the relevant IFRS Standards when IFRS is adopted. 
 
 
 
The Bank transferred an amount of Birr 25.01 million to the regulatory risk reserve. from this amount 
23.88 million represents the difference between the provisions for credit and other known losses as 
determined under the NBE Directives, and the impairment reserve as determined in line with IAS 39 as at 
year end and 1.13 million represent 70% of suspended interest income kept under regulatory reserve 
account until NBE amended the directive.

4.3.9 
Collateral held and their financial effect 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The general creditworthiness of a customer tends to be the most relevant indicator of credit quality of a 
loan extended to it. However, collateral provides additional security and the Bank generally requests that 
corporate borrowers provide it. Staff loans are secured to the extent of the employee's continued 
employment in the Bank. 
The Bank may take collateral in the form of a first charge over real estate, liens and guarantees. The Bank 
does not sell or repledge the collateral in the absence of default by the owner of the collateral. In addition 
to the Bank's focus on creditworthiness, the Bank aligns with its credit policy guide to periodically update 
the validation of collaterals held against all loans to customers.  
For impaired loans, the Bank obtains appraisals of collateral because the fair value of the collateral is an 
input to the impairment measurement. 
The fair value of the collaterals are based on the last revaluations carried out by the Bank's in-house 
engineers. The valuation technique adopted for properties is in line with the Bank's  valuation manual and 
the revalued amount is similar to fair values of properties with similar size and location. 
 
The fair value of collaterals other than properties such as share certificates, cash, NBE bills etc.  as 
disclosed at the carrying amount as management is of the opinion that the cost of the process of 
establishing the fair value of the collateral exceeds benefits accruable from the exercise.  
 
 
 
 
4.4 
Liquidity risk 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank cannot meet its maturing obligations when they become due, at 
reasonable cost and in a timely manner. Liquidity risk arises because of the possibility that the Bank might 
be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due as a result of mismatches in the timing of 
the cash flows under both normal and stress circumstances. Such scenarios could occur when funding 
needed for illiquid asset positions is not available to the Bank on acceptable terms. 
Liquidity risk management in the Bank is solely determined by Asset-Liability Management Committee, 
which bears the overall responsibility for liquidity risk. The main objective of the Bank's liquidity risk 
framework is to maintain sufficient liquidity in order to ensure that we meet our maturing obligations. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.4.1 
Management of liquidity risk 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
'Cash flow forecasting is performed by the finance department. The finance department monitors rolling 
forecasts of liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs.  
 
 
 
 
 
The Bank has incurred indebtedness in the form of borrowings. The Bank evaluates its ability to meet its 
obligations on an ongoing basis. Based on these evaluations, the Bank devises strategies to manage its 
liquidity risk. 
 
 
 
 
 
Prudent liquidity risk management implies that sufficient cash is maintained and that sufficient funding is 
available to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring 
unacceptable losses or risk damage to the Bank’s reputation.

Interest rate risk 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will be affected by changes in market 
interest rates. Borrowings obtained at variable rates give rise to interest rate risk.  
 
The Bank’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Bank’s 
obligations and financial assets with floating interest rates. The Bank is also exposed on fixed rate financial 
assets and financial liabilities. The Bank’s investment portfolio is comprised of treasury bills, loans and

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2018
 
The sensitivity of the income statement is the effect of the assumed changes in saving interest rates on 
the profit or loss for a year, based on the floating rate non–trading financial assets and financial liabilities 
held at 30 June 2018, 30 June 2017 and 1 July 2016. The total sensitivity of equity is based on the 
assumption that there are parallel shifts in the yield curve.

(ii) 
Foreign exchange risk 
 
 
 
 
 
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
due to the changes in foreign exchange rates.  
The Bank is exposed to exchange rate risks to the extent of balances and transactions denominated in a 
currency other than the Ethiopian Birr. The Bank’s foreign currency bank accounts act as a natural hedge for 
these transactions. Management has set up a policy to manage the Bank's foreign exchange risk against its 
functional currency. 
The table below summarises the impact of increases/decreases of 10% on equity and profit or loss arising from 
the Bank's foreign denominated borrowings and cash and bank balances. 
The total foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities exposed to risk as at year end was Birr -108.5 
million as fcy liability (30 June 2017: Birr 39.42 million, 1 July 2016: Birr 180.05 million).

Sensitivity analysis for foreign exchange risk 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The sensitivity analysis for currency rate risk shows how changes in the fair value or future cash flows of a 
financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market rates at the reporting date. 
 
The sensitivity of the Bank's earnings to fluctuations in exchange rates is reflected by varying the 
exchange rates at 10% as shown below:

Capital management 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Bank’s objectives when managing capital are to comply with the capital requirements set by the 
National Bank of Ethiopia, safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, and to maintain a strong 
capital base  so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development 
of the business.   
 
 
 
 
4.6.1 
Capital adequacy ratio 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The capital adequacy ratio is the quotient of the capital base of the Bank and the Bank’s risk weighted 
asset base. The Bank's capital is divided into two tiers: 
 
 
 
 
 
- Tier 1 capital includes share capital, retained earnings and deductions for intangible assets, and other 
regulatory adjustments relating to items that are included in equity but are treated differently for capital 
adequacy purposes. Regulatory risk reserve is not recognised as a component of qualifying capital. 
However, any balance, should be netted off against the total risk weighted assets (RWA). 
 
 
 
 
 
- Tier 2 capital includes qualifying subordinated liabilities and certain provisions for loan losses that are 
presently unidentified on an individual basis.

4.7 
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IFRS 13 requires an entity to classify measured or disclosed fair values according to a hierarchy that 
reflects the significance of observable inputs. 
 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, which comprises of three levels as described below, based on 
the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.7.1 
Valuation models 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IFRS 13 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation 
techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable input reflect market data obtained from 
independent sources; unobservable inputs reflect the Bank's market assumptions. 
 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole. 
 
● Level 1: Inputs that are quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities. 
 
●Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) .This category includes 
instruments valued using: quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for 
identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active, or other valuation 
technique in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data. 
 
In conclusion, this category is for valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable. 
 
● Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable 
inputs). This category includes all assets and liabilities for which the valuation technique includes inputs 
not based on observable date and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the asset or 
liability's valuation. This category includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar 
instruments for which significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect 
differences between the instruments. 
 
 
 
 
4.7.2 
Financial instruments not measured at fair value - Fair value hierarchy 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following table summarises the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the reporting 
date by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised. The 
amounts are based on the values recognised in the statement of financial position.

Fair value measurement of the Bank's Investment properties 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Bank's investment property is measured at cost. These properties include those held for rental purposes and 
those in which the Bank occupies an insignificant portion. These properties are held to earn rentals and for 
capital appreciation. There are currently no restrictions on the reliability of these properties. 
 
 
Investment property is initially measured at cost including transaction costs and subsequently measured at 
depreciated cost (less any accumulated impairment losses). Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line 
method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives of 50 years. The fair value 
of investment properties has been disclosed as required. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The fair value of the Bank's Investment property as at June 30,2016 and has been arrived at by in-house 
engineers qualified estate surveyors and reviewed and approved by independent valuers. These valuers have 
appropriate qualifications and recent experience in the valuation of properties in the relevant locations.

Fair value measurement of the Bank's Investment properties (Contd) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The fair value was determined based on the replacement cost concept which approximates the estimated 
amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between knowledgeable willing parties in 
an arm's length transaction after proper marketing, prudently and without compulsion.  
 
 
This implies a market comparable approach that reflects the recent transaction prices for similar properties). In 
estimating the fair value of the properties, the highest and best use of the properties is their current use. There 
has been no change to the valuation technique during the year.

The Bank operates an unfunded severance pay plan for its employees who have served the Bank for 5 years 
and above and are below the retirement age (i.e. has not met the requirement to access the pension fund). 
The final pay-out is determined by reference to current benefit’s level (monthly salary) and number of years in 
service and is calculated as 1 month salary for the first year in employment plus 1/3 of monthly salary for each 
subsequent in employment to a maximum of 12 months final monthly salary.

The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions 
constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When 
calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method 
(present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the 
reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of 
financial position. 
 
There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior years. 
The average duration of the severance pay plan at the end of the reporting period is 2.78 years

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding 
to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. There were no potentially dilutive shares at the 
reporting date (30 June 2018:nil, 1 July 2017: nil), hence the basic and diluted loss per share have the same 
value.

The Regulatory risk reserve is a non-distributable reserves required by the regulations of the National Bank of 
Ethiopia(NBE) to be kept for impairment losses on loans and receivables in excess of IFRS charge as derived 
using the incurred loss model. 
 
Where the loan loss impairment determined using the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) guidelines is higher than 
the loan loss impairment determined using the incurred loss model under IFRS, the difference is transferred to 
regulatory risk reserve and it is non-distributable to the owners of the Bank. 
 
Where the loan loss impairment determined using the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) guidelines is less than the 
loan loss impairment determined using the incurred loss model under IFRS, the difference is transferred from 
regulatory risk reserve to the retained earning to the extent of the non-distributable reserve previously 
recognised. 
Where the 70% of suspended interest income kept under this regulatory reserve account until the 
regulatory organs (NBE) amended the directive related with provision.

The Bank is a party to numerous legal actions brought by different organizations and individuals arising from 
its normal business operations. The maximum exposure of the Bank to these legal cases as at 30 June 2018 is 
Birr 6.7 million (30 June 2017: Birr 6.7 million, 1 July 2016: Birr 6.7). No provision has been made in the 
financial statements as the Directors believe that it is not probable that the economic benefits would flow out 
of the Bank in respect of these legal actions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
36b Guarantees and letters of credit 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Bank conducts business involving performance bonds and guarantees. These instruments are given as a 
security to support the performance of a customer to third parties. As the Bank will only be required to 
meet these obligations in the event of the customer's default, the cash requirements of these instruments are 
expected to be considerably below their nominal amounts.

NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2018
 
 
 
 
 
39 
First-time adoption of IFRS for the Bank 
 
 
 
 
These financial statements, for the year ended 30 June 2018, are the first the Bank has prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).  
 
For periods up to and including the year ended 30 June 2017, the Bank prepared its financial statements in accordance with its accounting framework. 
Accordingly, the Bank has prepared financial statements which comply with IFRS applicable for periods ending on or after  30 June 2018, together with the 
comparative period data as at and for the year ended 30 June 2017, as described in the summary of significant accounting policies. 
 
In preparing these financial statements, the Bank’s opening statement of financial position was prepared as at 1 July 2016, the Bank’s date of transition to IFRS. 
This note explains the principal adjustments made by the Bank in restating its financial statements prepared under the previous framework, including the 
statement of financial position as at 1 July 2016 and the financial statements as at and for the year ended 30 June 2017. 
 
In preparing its opening IFRS statement of financial position, the Bank has adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared in accordance 
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of Ethiopia and the Commercial code of 1960. An explanation of how the transition from GAAP to IFRS has 
affected the Bank's financial position, financial performance and cash flows is set out in the following tables and the notes that accompany the tables. 
 
The most significant IFRS impact for the Bank resulted from the implementation of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement which requires 
the bank to classify its financial instruments into available for sale, fair value through profit and loss, loans and receivables and held to maturity. Also the 
impairment of financial assets only in cases where there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more loss events that occurred after the initial 
recognition of the asset (referred to as an "incurred loss" model).  
 
In preparing these financial statements in accordance with IFRS 1, the Bank has applied the mandatory exceptions from full retrospective application of IFRS. The 
optional exemptions from full retrospective application selected by the Bank are summarized below. 
 
Exemptions applied 
 
IFRS 1 allows first-time adopters certain exemptions from the retrospective application of certain requirements under IFRS. Following from the principles 
underpinning IFRS 1, the Bank has applied the following exemptions: 
 
(a) Deemed cost for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets  
 
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets were carried in the statement of financial position prepared in fair value. The Bank has elected to regard 
those values as deemed cost at the transition date as carrying value under GAAP and IFRS is not expected to be materially different. 
 
(b) Leases 
 
Banks are required to determine whether an arrangement contains a lease based on the facts and circumstances existing on 1 July 2016. Any contracts that 
exist would result in classification based on the facts and circumstances that exist at transition date.

BANK OF ABYSSINIA
NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2018
 
 
 
 
 
(c) Designation of Previously Recognised Financial Instruments 
 
Applying this exemption means that Banks is permitted to designate a financial asset as available-for-sale at the date of transition to IFRS. The Bank has 
designated unquoted equity instruments held at 1 July 2016 as available-for-sale investments. 
 
(d) Fair value measurement of financial instruments at initial recognition 
 
Banks may apply the requirement to recognise day 1 gain or loss prospectively to transactions entered into on or after the date of transition to IFRS. This will 
result in no gain or loss recognised on the initial recognition of a financial asset or financial liability prior to 1 July 2016. 
 
(e) Joint arrangements 
 
Applying this exemption means that the Bank can apply the transition provisions in IFRS 11, with the following exceptions: 
• The Bank applies the transition provisions at the date of transition to IFRS. 
• When changing from proportionate consolidation to the equity method, a first-time adopter tests the investment for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 
as at the date of transition to IFRS, regardless of whether there is any indication that the investment might be impaired. Any resulting impairment is 
recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings at the date of transition to IFRS 
 
Exceptions applied 
 
(a) Estimates 
 
Estimates made in accordance with IFRSs at the date of transition to IFRS should be consistent with estimates made for the same date in accordance with 
previous GAAP (after adjustments to reflect any differences in accounting policies), unless there is objective evidence that those estimates were in error or 
where application of previous framework did not require estimation such as post-employment benefits 
 
(b) De-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities 
 
This exception exempts a first time adopter from full retrospective application of the de-recognition rules in IAS 39, "Financial instruments: 
Recognition and measurement", for all financial assets and liabilities derecognised before 1 January 2004 or transition date. Therefore, 
financial assets and liabilities derecognised before 1 July 2016 are not re-recognised under IFRS

Notes on reclassification and remeasurement 
 
 
 
 
 
Under the Ethiopian GAAP the financial instrument is carried at the nominal value less principal repayments and the related interest income and/or expense 
is recognised on a straight line basis (daily accrual) by applying the contractual rate to the nominal amount. Interest is as a result accrued for and 
recognized as a current asset and/or liability (accrued interest) which is derecognised with the actual cash flow. 
 
Under IFRS, any difference between the amounts of interest accrued using the EIR and the actual interest payments forms part of the amortised cost 
carrying amount.
