MESSAGE OF THE
BOARD CHAIRPERSON
Honorable Shareholders, 
On behalf of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Abyssinia S.C and myself, I am honored to present 
the Board of Directors’ Report along with the “Audited Financial Statements” of the Bank to the 24th 
Ordinary Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders of the Bank for the Fiscal Year 2019/20 that ended 
June 30, 2020. 
The Fiscal Year 2019/20 saw a major shock in global economic environment wherein the Covid-19 
pandemic put a severe impact on economic activity as countries followed lockdowns and widespread 
closures to slow the spread of the virus. The health crisis came at a time when the world was experiencing 
softened momentum in global activity following trade tension between the leading world economies, 
USA and China and other uncertainties leading to recession, i.e. a negative growth of 4.9% in 2020 
(IMF’s WEO update, June 2020).  
The domestic economy has also felt the impact of the pandemic which, however, had seen largely positive 
growth indications before the onset of Covid-19 in March 2020. It has been undergoing challenges from 
continued security concerns, that were also compounded by persistent foreign exchange shortage and 
rising price levels on top of negative eﬀ
 ects of the pandemic observed in a notable business slowdown. 
Against all odds, the Ethiopian economy is estimated to have achieved positive growth in the Fiscal Year 
2019/20, which is 6% by estimates of the Ethiopian government.
The Bank, once again, registered a commendable asset growth in the Fiscal Year despite the tough 
global and domestic economic conditions. Driven by the well thought out and articulated strategy with 
a clear direction, the Bank has made a stride in both ﬁ
 nancial and non-ﬁ
 nancial results. 
During the ended Fiscal Year, which marked the end of the ﬁ
 rst year in the 5-year strategic period, BoA 
had achieved remarkable outcome in incremental deposit growth that was more than twice what was 
achieved last year, and the total outstanding deposit balance reached Birr 47.63 billion as at June 30, 
2020, i.e. a 48% growth from last year’s level. Total loans and advances also increased by 57% from the 
2018/19 position of Birr 23.74 billion and reached Birr 37.25 billion (Birr 36.8 billion net oﬀ
  impairment 
charges) in the end of 2019/20. 
The Bank’s total revenue reached Birr 5.67 billion, registering a 32% rise from the previous year, i.e. 
4.29 billion. The Bank has also registered a gross proﬁ
 t before tax of Birr 1.08 billion, which has grown 
Years of Success
9
by 6% from that of the preceding year. Accordingly, the Bank’s total assets grew by 45% and reached 
Birr 56.89 billion while total equity rose by 15% and reached Birr 5.68 billion.
In the year under review, the Bank continued to invest in expanding accessibility and customer outreach. 
With a strategic view of ensuring sustainable growth and proﬁ
 tability, the Bank has carried out various 
activities and projects geared towards operational excellence and digitalization which are expected to 
drive up its competitive edge. During the reporting year, several IT and digital banking initiatives are 
underway aimed at transforming the business and bringing about operational excellence. 
Most of the IT and digital initiatives are completed while a few are at advanced stage of completion. 
To mention some, the Bank has implemented a well-established Contact Center in order to improve 
customer experience at BoA which has scaled up to rendering services for 24 hours since December 
2019. In promoting its digital banking services, the Bank has become the ﬁ
 rst in Ethiopia to launch 
e-commerce acquiring business through partnership with Visa and using Visa Cyber source payment 
gateway. Moreover, in its continued trend of being a pioneer in the Ethiopian banking industry, the 
Bank has completed ground works, and readying virtual banking service centers to be launched in early 
2020/21, which is a new service oﬀ
 er in the industry. 
Moreover, in the area of asset build up, the Bank has continued undertaking construction projects both 
new and rolled over from preceding years by allocating signiﬁ
 cant resources. These projects would 
ultimately help in strengthening its asset position and brand image. Construction projects that have 
been underway, during the reporting Period, including Ras Branch building are in good progress and are 
expected to be completed in the current year. Hawassa and Jimma branch buildings are both completed 
and gone operational. On the other hand, the corporate building project, which is to be the Bank’s future 
Headquarters building (around Mexico Square), has been put oﬀ
  since pre-construction works are still 
underway. 
Honorable Shareholders, 
Bank of Abyssinia is well aware of the rapidly changing business environment within which it operates, 
i.e. changing customers’ expectations and behaviors, growing competition in the banking industry, 
advancements in ﬁ
 nancial technologies and varying demographic, economic and political dynamics. The 
Bank’s strategy being implemented needs to keep track of these changing dynamics and endeavor to 
respond decisively, by exploring opportunities and mitigating business risks owing to these fast changing 
global, domestic and industry developments. 
Following the change of leadership and organizational structure, supported by large investment outlays 
on state-of-the art IT infrastructure and digital tech platforms, which enabled process improvement, 
the Bank has completed the ﬁ
 rst year of its strategy implementation at high growth trajectory in most 
of the ﬁ
 nancial and non-ﬁ
 nancial objectives. However, the proﬁ
 tability is not as targeted for the clear 
reason that the Bank’s focus has been on investment to advance its technological infrastructure and 
branch opening.  The foundation laid so far is expected to help it navigate through challenges, enhance 
its competitive capability and realize its vision “To become a leading commercial bank in East Africa by 
2030”.
Going forward, banking business is expected to be more competitive. Entry of specialized banks to the 
market, opening of the industry to non-traditional players, directives by NBE that would reduce the near 
monopoly of ﬁ
 nancial service delivery by banks, would all require the management and staﬀ
  of BoA to 
exert renewed eﬀ
 ort to achieve targets set in the strategy.
I am sure, having the support of all stakeholders by our side, we will achieve the targets set in the 
new strategy, play our role in the ﬁ
 nancial inclusion agenda of the country and realize our vision to the 
satisfaction of all stakeholders.
Finally, on behalf of the Board of Directors and myself, I would like to seize this opportunity to express 
my sincere gratitude to our esteemed customers for their conﬁ
 dence and trust to continue to do business 
with our Bank, to our shareholders for their support, to my fellow members of the Board of Directors, the 
Executive Management and employees of BoA for their dedication and commitment, and to the National 
Bank of Ethiopia for its guidance.
Thank you all!!

MESSAGE OF THE
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Dear Esteemed Shareholders,
I am pleased to report that Bank of Abyssinia has had a solid performance both in ﬁ
 nancial and non-
ﬁ
 nancial measures in 2019/20 while laying a good foundation for realizing sustainable growth and 
proﬁ
 tability in line with its strategy. 
The year 2019/20 marks the 25th anniversary of our Bank, and I would like to congratulate our 
esteemed shareholders, the Board of Directors, Executive Management and employees, our customers 
as well as our partners on the Silver Jubilee of the Bank. 
Indeed the Fiscal Year 2019/20 observed challenges in the global and domestic socio economic 
environments wherein the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted economic activities both in advanced 
as well as emerging economies inﬂ
 icting stress on activities during the second half of the Fiscal Year. 
Globally, economic activity has been severely impacted due to lockdown and widespread closures in 
an eﬀ
 ort to slow down the spread of the virus. As a result of the pandemic, global growth is expected 
to be contracted sharply by -4.9% in 2020 and only to gradually recover at 5.4% in 2021. In the 
domestic front, Ethiopia’s GDP growth was estimated to be 6% in 2019/2020 per the National Planning 
and Development Commission. On top of the negative eﬀ
 ects of Covid-19 outbreak, the domestic 
economy has been challenged with heightened conﬂ
 icts and business disruptions, forex shortages and 
worsened terms of trade. In connection with this, the banking industry faced immense challenges in 
terms of resource mobilization, both in domestic and foreign currency.
In the face of these environmental challenges, however, BoA managed to secure asset growth wherein 
the total deposit reached Birr 47.63 billion by achieving incremental deposit growth of Birr 15.48 from 
that of Birr 32.15 billion of the preceding year, the highest from among private banks in net mobilization. 
In another eﬀ
 ort, the overall foreign currency earnings stood at USD 400.31 million ,which was higher 
by 16.8% than that of the preceding year. The total outstanding loans and advances amount reached 
Birr 37.25 billion (Birr 36.8 billion net oﬀ
  impairment charges), surpassing the preceding year’s balance 
by Birr 13.51 billion which also witnessed remarkable growth. Total asset and capital of the Bank 
reached Birr 56.89 billion and Birr 5.68 billion, growing by 45% and 15% respectively. The paid up 
capital of the Bank has reached Birr 3.15 billion and the total subscribed capital Birr 4 billion.
Years of Success
11
The Bank’s proﬁ
 tability has also continued increasing wherein total revenue reached Birr 5.67 billion, 
which grew by 32% from the preceding year's level. Gross proﬁ
 t has also shown an increase from last 
year and reached Birr 1.08 billion during 2019/20, i.e. 6% higher than last year. 
The Bank has been strategically expanding its branch network and thus managed to open 166 
additional branches in 2019/20 Fiscal Year , raising the total number of branches to 503. In an eﬀ
 ort 
to reach more customers, the Bank also increased deposit customer base by more than 1.3 million 
additional customers and thus the total number reached 2,605,315; of which Interest Free Banking 
accounts were 195,109.
Moreover, we have continued expanding digital channels with a view to improve and diversify service 
delivery. Accordingly, additional 400 ATMs and 300 POS terminals have been deployed in diﬀ
 erent 
locations across the country. We have been able to double our cardholder customer-base this year by 
reaching over 910,000 cardholders, showing a tremendous growth over the previous Fiscal Year.
During the year, also the Bank has ﬁ
 nalized the process of establishing a virtual banking service to 
be oﬀ
 ered at selected locations, which is a new type of digital banking service to be delivered in the 
industry. On commencement of this fully automated service that is ready to be introduced shortly, 
customers shall be able to alternatively get most of the services obtained at branches such as account 
opening, cash deposits /withdrawals, etc. operated by themselves and available 24 hours a day and 
7 days a week.
On top of that, the Bank has launched yet another new service oﬀ
 ering in the industry by introducing 
e-commerce acquiring business using Visa Cyber source payment gateway. The service has commenced 
on cross-border transactions and now customers can make online shopping and other online services 
using their international cards, i.e. VISA and MasterCard as forms of payment.
Respected Shareholders,
We are ready to receive the new Fiscal Year with renewed commitment and dedication by holding 
up our Bank’s vision, through providing reliable and customer-friendly banking services by deploying 
state-of-the-art technology while developing our employees’ skills towards service excellence, thereby 
increasing sustainable growth and generation of proﬁ
 t. 
With the farsighted leadership from the Board of Directors, strong commitment and dedication from 
the management and staﬀ
 , and having the support of our esteemed shareholders and customers at 
our side, I would like to state conﬁ
 dently that we will achieve far better results in the next Fiscal Year 
as well.
Finally, I would like to convey my sincere gratitude to our esteemed customers for banking with us; 
the Bank’s shareholders for their support; Board of Directors for their guidance; the Management team 
and the entire staﬀ
  for their commitment and dedication and the National Bank of Ethiopia for the 
assistance provided to us during the Fiscal Year.
Thank you all
     Bekalu Zeleke

 ts, general and administrative as well as provision expenses constituted 39.4%, 39.8%,

The rise in the cost of funds in major expense items, interest expenses and non-interest expenses 
could mainly be attributed to the growth in the Bank’s deposits and aggressive branch network 
expansion activities (savings and salaries and general expenses).

3. Administrative and other Issues
3.1 Human Resources
The Bank has continued to strengthen its human resource, which reached 6,700 at the end of the 
Fiscal Year. The Bank's human resource grew following the opening of additional branches and 
business expansions and thus recruitment of new personnel to meet the ensuing human resource 
requirements. The overall attrition in the budget year was 186 personnel as a result of retirement, 
resignation and other reasons, which was less than the anticipated attrition for the year. From the 
20 |  Bank of Abyssinia S.C      Annual Report 2019/20
total number of attrition, 56 personnel used to hold managerial position while 111 were clerical 
and 19 were non-clerical staﬀ
 . 
During the stated year, developmental and technical trainings were provided to a total of 2,853 and 
5,071 employees respectively at Head Oﬃ
  ce and District levels through in-house and outsourced 
trainers; bringing the number of employees who acquired capacity building trainings to 7,924. As 
a result of COVID-19, the learning and development activities were directed towards introducing 
online based capacity development trainings as much as possible, thus few training activities were 
conducted during the ﬁ
 nal quarter of the reviewed period.     
3.2 Expansion of Branches 
With a view to become more accessible to the public, Bank of Abysinia has been aggressively 
expanding its branch networks. To this end, during the period ended June 30, 2020; the Bank has 
opened 166 new branches and sub-branches thereby bringing the total number of its branches 
to 503. Accordingly, the Bank stands ﬁ
 rst among the private banks in number of branch outlets.

In accordance with the Financial Reporting Proclamation No.847/2014, Bank of Abyssinia is required

(IFRS)as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and in the manner required 
by the Commercial Code of Ethiopia of 1960.  The Directors of the Bank are  responsible for the 
preparation and fair presentation of these ﬁ

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF BANK OF ABYSSINIA SHARE COMPANY
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying ﬁ
 nancial statements of Bank of Abyssinia Share Company (hereinafter 
referred to as the Bank), which comprise the statement of ﬁ
 nancial position as at 30 June 2020, and the 
statements of proﬁ
 t or loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash ﬂ
 ows for the 
year then ended, and notes to the ﬁ
 nancial statements, including signiﬁ
 cant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information. 
In our opinion, the accompanying ﬁ
 nancial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the ﬁ
 nancial 
position of the Bank as at 30 June 2020, and its ﬁ
 nancial performance and its cash ﬂ
 ows for the year then 
ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the requirements of the 
Commercial Code of Ethiopia of 1960.
We have no comments to make on the report of the Board of Directors relating to the ﬁ
 nancial matters 
and pursuant to Article 375 (2) of the Commercial Code of Ethiopia of 1960, and recommend the above 
mentioned ﬁ
 nancial statements be approved.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the ‘Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial 
Statements’ section of our report. We are independent of the Bank in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the ﬁ
 nancial statements in the Federal Democratic Republic 
of Ethiopia, and we have fulﬁ
 lled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suﬃ
  cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion.
Other Information
The Directors are responsible for the other information, which comprises the report of the Board of 
Directors’ as required by the Commercial Code of Ethiopia 1960 and A Proclamation to Provide for Banking 
Business No. 592/2008 of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, and directives of the National Bank 
of Ethiopia. 
Our opinion on the ﬁ
 nancial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the ﬁ
 nancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the ﬁ
 nancial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, and then we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial 
Statements
The Management of the Bank are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the ﬁ
 nancial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and the requirements 
of the Commercial Code of Ethiopian of 1960, and for such internal control as management determines 
is necessary to enable the preparation of ﬁ
 nancial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the ﬁ
 nancial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has 
no realistic alternative but to do so

Getachew Kassaye & Simon Audit Partnership
(Formerly Getachew Kassay & Co.)
Chartered Certiﬁ
 ed Accountants
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Bank’s ﬁ
 nancial reporting process.
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁ
 nancial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to inﬂ
 uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
ﬁ
 nancial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁ
 nancial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that 
is suﬃ
  cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
eﬀ
 ectiveness of the Bank’s internal control. 
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by management. 
• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast signiﬁ
 cant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, then we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ 
report to the related disclosures in the ﬁ
 nancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a 
going concern. 
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the ﬁ
 nancial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the ﬁ
 nancial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in 
a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
• Obtain suﬃ
  cient appropriate audit evidence regarding the ﬁ
 nancial information of the Bank or business 
activities within the Bank to express an opinion on the ﬁ
 nancial statements. We are responsible for 
the direction, supervision and performance of the audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and signiﬁ
 cant audit ﬁ
 ndings including any signiﬁ
 cant deﬁ
 ciencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.

Summary of signiﬁ
 cant accounting policies
2.1
Introduction to summary of signiﬁ
 cant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these ﬁ
 nancial statements 
are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, 
unless otherwise stated.
2.2
Basis of preparation
The ﬁ
 nancial statements for the period ended 30 June 2020 have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). Additional information required by 
national regulations is included where appropriate. 
The ﬁ
 nancial statements comprise the statement of proﬁ
 t or loss and other comprehensive 
income, the statement of ﬁ
 nancial position, the statement of changes in equity, the statement 
of cash ﬂ
 ows and the notes to the ﬁ
 nancial statements.
The ﬁ
 nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern 
principle under the historical cost concept, except for the following;
•  Buildings under  property, plant and equipment  – measured at fair value as deemed cost
•  Assets held for sale – measured at fair value less cost of disposal, and
•  Deﬁ
 ned beneﬁ
 t pension plans – plan assets measured at fair value.
All values are rounded to the nearest thousand, except when otherwise indicated. The 
ﬁ
 nancial statements are presented in thousands of Ethiopian Birr (Birr’ 000).
The preparation of ﬁ
 nancial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain 
critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the 
process of applying the Bank’s accounting policies. Changes in assumptions may have 
a signiﬁ
 cant impact on the ﬁ
 nancial statements in the period the assumptions changed. 
Management believes that the underlying assumptions are appropriate and that the Bank’s 
ﬁ
 nancial statements therefore present the ﬁ
 nancial position and results fairly. The areas 
involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and 
estimates are signiﬁ
 cant to the ﬁ
 nancial statements, are disclosed in Note 4.

BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020
2.2.1
Going concern
The ﬁ
 nancial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The management 
have no doubt that the Bank would remain in existence after 12 months.
2.2.2
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
In the current year, the Bank has adopted the following standards and interpretations that 
are eﬀ
 ective for the current ﬁ
 nancial year and that are relevant to its operations
IFRS 16 Leases.
The Bank applied IFRS 16 using the modiﬁ
 ed retrospective aproach under which, the 
comparative information presneted for 2019 is not restated-i.e. it is presneted, as previously 
reported, under IAS 17 and related interpretations. The details of the changes in accounting 
policies are discloused below. Addditionaly, the disclousre requirements in IFRS 16 have not 
generaly been applied to comparative information.
Deﬁ
 nition of Lease
Previously, the Bank detremined at contract inception whether an arrangement is or contains 
a lease under IFRIC 4. Determining whether an arrangement contains a Lease. The Bank 
now assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease based on the deﬁ
 nition of a lease.
On trasition to IFRS 16, the Bank elected to apply the practical expendient to assesment of 
which trasactions are lease
A a Lessee
As a Lessee, the Bank leases some branch. The Bank previuosly classﬁ
 ed there leases as 
operating leases under IAS 17 based on its assessment of whether the lease transferred 
substantially all of the risks and rewards incedental to ownership of the underlying asset to 
the Bank. Under IFRS 16, the Bank recognises right-of-use assests and lease liablities for 
leases of  Branch.
On transition, for these leases, lease liabilities were measured at the presnet value of the 
remaining lease payments,discounted at the Bank’s incremental borrowing rate
Right-of-use assests are measured at their carrying amount as if IFRS 16 had been appplied 
since the commencement date,discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at 
the date of intial application.
The Bank used a number of practical expedients when applying IFRS 16 to leases previously 
classﬁ
 ed as operating leases under IAS 17. 
The Bank did not recognise right-of use assets and liabilities for leases for which the lease 
term ends within 12 months of the date of intial application:
— Did not recognise right-of use assets and liabilities for leases of low-value asses (ATM rent): 
— Exclued intial direct costs from measuring the right-of-use asset at the date of intial application
Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments 
The interpretation clariﬁ
 es how to apply the recognition and measurement requirements in 
IAS 12 when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. Speciﬁ
 cally, if it is probable
Years of Success
39
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020
that the tax authorities will accept the uncertain tax treatment, then all tax related items 
are measured according to the planned tax treatment. If it is not probable that the tax 
authorities will accept the uncertain tax treatment, then the tax related items are measured 
on the basis of probabilities to reﬂ
 ect the uncertainty. Changes in facts and circumstances 
are required to be treated as changes in estimates and applied prospectively.
The eﬀ
 ective date of the interpretation is for years beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The Bank has adopted the interpretation for the ﬁ
 rst time in the 2020 annual ﬁ
 nancial 
statements. 
The impact of the interpretation is not material. 
2.3
Foreign currency translation
a)
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the ﬁ
 nancial statements are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the Bank operates (‘the functional currency’). The functional 
currency and presentation currency of the Bank is the Ethiopian Birr (Birr). 
b)
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange 
rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting 
from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and from the translation at exchange 
rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Bank’s 
functional currency are recognised in proﬁ
 t or loss within other (loss)/income. Monetary 
items denominated in foreign currency are translated using the closing rate as at the 
reporting date.
Changes in the fair value of monetary securities denominated in foreign currency classiﬁ
 ed 
as available for sale are analysed between translation diﬀ
 erences resulting from changes in 
the amortised cost of the security and other changes in the carrying amount of the security. 
Translation diﬀ
 erences related to changes in amortised cost are recognised in proﬁ
 t or 
loss, and other changes in carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Translation diﬀ
 erences on non-monetary ﬁ
 nancial assets and liabilities such as equities held 
at fair value through proﬁ
 t or loss are recognised in proﬁ
 t or loss as part of the fair value 
gain or loss. Translation diﬀ
 erences on non-monetary ﬁ
 nancial assets measure at fair value, 
such as equities classiﬁ
 ed as available for sale, are included in other comprehensive income.
2.4
Financial assets and ﬁ
 nancial liabilities
2.4.1
Recognition and initial measurement
The Bank shall initially recognise loans and advances, deposits, debt securities issued 
and subordinated liabilities on the date on which they are originated. All other ﬁ
 nancial 
instruments (including regular-way purchases and sales of ﬁ
 nancial assets) shall be 
recognised on the trade date, which is the date on which the Bank becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. 
A ﬁ
 nancial asset or ﬁ
 nancial liability shall be measured initially at fair value plus, for an 
item not at fair value through proﬁ
 t or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to its acquisition or issue. 
2.4.2
Classiﬁ
 cation and subsequent measurement
40 |  Bank of Abyssinia S.C      Annual Report 2019/20
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020
i)  Financial assets
On initial recognition, a ﬁ
 nancial asset shall be classiﬁ
 ed either as measured at either 
amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through 
proﬁ
 t or loss (FVTPL). 
The Bank shall measure a ﬁ
 nancial asset at amortised cost if it meets both of the following 
conditions and is not designated at FVTPL: 
—  The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect 
 
contractual cash ﬂ
 ows; and 
—  The contractual terms of the ﬁ
 nancial asset give rise on speciﬁ
 ed dates to cash ﬂ
 ows 
that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). `
     A debt instrument shall be measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following 
conditions and is not designated at FVTPL: 
—  The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting 
contractual cash ﬂ
 ows and selling ﬁ
 nancial assets; and 
—  The contractual terms of the ﬁ
 nancial asset give rise on speciﬁ
 ed dates to cash ﬂ
 ows 
that are SPPI. 
On initial recognition, an equity investment that is held for trading shall be classiﬁ
 ed at 
FVTPL.  However, for equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably 
elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income (OCI). 
This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. 
All other ﬁ
 nancial assets that do not meet the classiﬁ
 cation criteria at amortised cost or 
FVOCI, above, shall be classiﬁ
 ed as measured at FVTPL. 
In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a ﬁ
 nancial asset that 
otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL 
if doing so eliminates or signiﬁ
 cantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise 
arise.
—  Business model assessment 
The Bank shall make an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset 
is held at a portfolio level because this best reﬂ
 ects the way the business is managed and 
information is provided to management. The information considered includes: 
—  The stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in 
practice. In particular, whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual 
interest revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate proﬁ
 le, matching the duration 
of the ﬁ
 nancial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or 
realising cash ﬂ
 ows through the sale of the assets; 
—  How the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Bank’s management; 
—  The risks that aﬀ
 ect the performance of the business model (and the ﬁ
 nancial assets held 
within that business model) and its strategy for how those risks are managed; 
—  How managers of the business are compensated (e.g. whether compensation is based 
on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash ﬂ
 ows collected); and 
—  The frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales 
and its expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity 
is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank’s 
stated objective for managing the ﬁ
 nancial assets is achieved and how cash ﬂ
 ows are 
realised. 
Years of Success
41
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020
Financial assets shall not be reclassiﬁ
 ed subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the 
period after the Bank changes its business model for managing ﬁ
 nancial assets. 
 Assessment of whether contractual cash ﬂ
 ows are solely payments of principal and interest 
For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ shall be deﬁ
 ned as the fair value of the 
ﬁ
 nancial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ shall be deﬁ
 ned as the consideration for the 
time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding 
during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity 
risk and administrative costs), as well as proﬁ
 t margin. 
In assessing whether the contractual cash ﬂ
 ows are SPPI, the Bank considers the contractual 
terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the ﬁ
 nancial asset contains a 
contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash ﬂ
 ows such that 
it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Bank considers: 
—  Contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash ﬂ
 ows; 
—  leverage features; 
—  Prepayment and extension terms; 
—  Terms that limit the Bank’s claim to cash ﬂ
 ows from speciﬁ
 ed assets (e.g. non-recourse 
 
     loans); and 
—  Features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset  
    of interest rates). 
ii)  Financial liabilities
The Bank shall classify its ﬁ
 nancial liabilities, other than ﬁ
 nancial guarantees and loan 
commitments, as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. 
A ﬁ
 nancial guarantee is an undertaking/commitment that requires the issuer to make 
speciﬁ
 ed payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a speciﬁ
 ed party fails 
to meet its obligation when due in accordance with the contractual terms.
Financial guarantees issued by the Bank are initially measured at their fair values and, if 
not designated as at FVTPL,are subsequently measured at the higher of: the amount of 
the obligation under the guarantee, as determined in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, 
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets; and the amount initially recognised less, where 
appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with the revenue recognition 
policies.
2.4.3
Impairment
At each reporting date, the Bank shall assess whether there is objective evidence that 
ﬁ
 nancial assets (except equity investments), other than those carried at FVTPL, are impaired.
The Bank shall recognise loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECL) on the following 
ﬁ
 nancial instruments that are not measured at FVTPL: 
—  Financial assets that are debt instruments; 
—  lease receivables; 
—  Financial guarantee contracts issued; and 
—  loan commitments issued. 
No impairment loss shall be recognised on equity investments. 
The Bank shall measure loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except for the 
following, which are measured as 12-month ECL: 
—  Debt investment securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting 
date; and 
42 |  Bank of Abyssinia S.C      Annual Report 2019/20
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020
—  Other ﬁ
 nancial instruments (other than lease receivables) on which credit risk has not 
increased signiﬁ
 cantly since their initial recognition. 
Loss allowances for lease receivables shall always be measured at an amount equal to 
lifetime ECL.
12-month ECL is the portion of ECL that result from default events on a ﬁ
 nancial instrument 
that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Financial instruments for 
which a 12-month ECL is recognised are referred to as ‘Stage 1 ﬁ
 nancial instruments’. 
Life-time ECL is the ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life 
of the ﬁ
 nancial instrument. Financial instruments for which a lifetime ECL is recognised but 
which are not credit-impaired are referred to as ‘Stage 2 ﬁ
 nancial instruments’. 
i)  Measurement of ECL 
ECL is a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. It shall be measured as follows: 
—  For ﬁ
 nancial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date (stage 1 and 2):as 
the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the diﬀ
 erence between the cash ﬂ
 ows due 
to the Bank in accordance with the contract and the cash ﬂ
 ows that the Bank expects 
to receive); 
—  For ﬁ
 nancial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date (stage 3): as the 
diﬀ
 erence between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future 
cash ﬂ
 ows; 
—  For undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the diﬀ
 erence between the 
contractual cash ﬂ
 ows that are due to the Bank if the commitment is drawn down and 
the cash ﬂ
 ows that the Bank expects to receive; and 
—  For ﬁ
 nancial guarantee contracts: as the expected payments to reimburse the holder less 
any amounts that the Bank expects to recover. 
ii)  Restructured ﬁ
 nancial assets 
Where the terms of a ﬁ
 nancial asset are renegotiated or modiﬁ
 ed or an existing ﬁ
 nancial 
asset is replaced with a new one due to ﬁ
 nancial diﬃ
  culties of the borrower, then the Bank 
shall assess whether the ﬁ
 nancial asset should be derecognised and ECL are measured as 
follows:
—  If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the 
expected cash ﬂ
 ows arising from the modiﬁ
 ed ﬁ
 nancial asset are included in calculating 
the cash shortfalls from the existing asset 
—  If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the 
expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the ﬁ
 nal cash ﬂ
 ow from the existing 
ﬁ
 nancial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the 
cash shortfalls from the existing ﬁ
 nancial asset that are discounted from the expected 
date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original eﬀ
 ective interest rate of 
the existing ﬁ
 nancial asset. 
iii) Credit-impaired ﬁ
 nancial  assets 
At each reporting date, the Bank shall assess whether ﬁ
 nancial assets carried at amortised 
cost, debt ﬁ
 nancial assets carried at FVOCI, and ﬁ
 nance lease receivables are credit-impaired 
(referred to as ‘Stage 3 ﬁ
 nancial assets’). 
A ﬁ
 nancial asset shall be considered ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a 
detrimental impact on the estimated future cash ﬂ
 ows of the ﬁ
 nancial asset have occurred. 
Evidence that a ﬁ
 nancial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data: 
—  Signiﬁ
 cant ﬁ
 nancial diﬃ
  culty of the borrower or issuer; 
Years of Success
43
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020
—  A breach of contract such as a default or past due event; 
—  The restructuring of a loan or advance by the Bank on terms that the Bank would not 
consider otherwise; 
—  It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other ﬁ
 nancial 
reorganisation; or 
—  The disappearance of an active market for a security because of ﬁ
 nancial diﬃ
  culties. 
A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition shall 
be considered to be credit-impair unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving 
contractual cash ﬂ
 ows has reduced signiﬁ
 cantly and there are no other indicators of 
impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more shall be considered 
credit-impaired even when the regulatory deﬁ
 nition of default is diﬀ
 erent. 
iv)  Presentation of allowance for ECL in the statement of ﬁ
 nancial position 
Loss allowances for ECL shall be presented in the statement of ﬁ
 nancial position as follows: 
—  For ﬁ
 nancial assets measured at amortised cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying 
amount of the assets; 
—  For loan commitments and ﬁ
 nancial guarantee contracts: generally, as a provision; 
—  Where a ﬁ
 nancial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and 
the Bank cannot identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from 
those on the drawn component: the Bank presents a combined loss allowance for both 
components. The combined amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying 
amount of the drawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over the gross 
amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision; and 
—  For debt instruments measured at FVOCI: no loss allowance is recognised in the 
statement of ﬁ
 nancial position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair 
value. However, the loss allowance shall be disclosed and is recognised in the fair value 
reserve. 
v)  Write-oﬀ
  
Loans and debt securities shall be written oﬀ
  (either partially or in full) when there is no 
reasonable expectation of recovering the amount in its entirety or a portion thereof. This 
is generally the case when the Bank determines that the borrower does not have assets or 
sources of income that could generate suﬃ
  cient cash ﬂ
 ows to repay the amounts subject to 
the write-oﬀ
 . This assessment shall be carried out at the individual asset level. 
Recoveries of amounts previously written oﬀ
  shall be included in ‘impairment losses on 
ﬁ
 nancial instruments’ in the statement of proﬁ
 t or loss and OCI.
Financial assets that are written oﬀ
  could still be subject to enforcement activities in order 
to comply with the Bank’s procedures for recovery of amounts due. 
vi)  Non-integral ﬁ
 nancial guarantee contracts 
The Bank shall assess whether a ﬁ
 nancial guarantee contract held is an integral element of 
a ﬁ
 nancial asset that is accounted for as a component of that instrument or is a contract 
that is accounted for separately. 
Where the Bank determines that the guarantee is an integral element of the ﬁ
 nancial asset, 
then any premium payable in connection with the initial recognition of the ﬁ
 nancial asset 
shall be treated as a transaction cost of acquiring it. The Bank shall consider the eﬀ
 ect of the 
protection when measuring the fair value of the debt instrument and when measuring ECL. 
44 |  Bank of Abyssinia S.C      Annual Report 2019/20
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020
Where the Bank determines that the guarantee is not an integral element of the debt 
instrument, then it shall recognise an asset representing any prepayment of guarantee 
premium and a right to compensation for credit losses. 
2.4.4.
Derecognition
i)  Financial assets 
The Bank shall derecognise a ﬁ
 nancial asset when:
—  The contractual right to the cash ﬂ
 ows from the ﬁ
 nancial asset expires, or 
—  It transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash ﬂ
 ows in a transaction in which 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the ﬁ
 nancial asset are 
transferred; or
—  Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership 
and it does not retain control of the ﬁ
 nancial asset.
On derecognition of a ﬁ
 nancial asset, the diﬀ
 erence between the carrying amount of the 
asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the 
sum of (i) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability 
assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI shall be 
recognised in proﬁ
 t or loss. 
Any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities 
designated as at FVOCI shall not be recognised in proﬁ
 t or loss on derecognition of such 
securities. 
Any interest in transferred ﬁ
 nancial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or 
retained by the Bank shall be recognised as a separate asset or liability. 
ii)  Financial liabilities
The Bank shall derecognise a ﬁ
 nancial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged 
or cancelled, or expire. 
2.4.5
Modiﬁ
 cations of ﬁ
 nancial assets and ﬁ
 nancial liabilities
i)  Financial assets 
If the terms of a ﬁ
 nancial asset are modiﬁ
 ed, then the Bank shall evaluate whether the cash 
ﬂ
 ows of the modiﬁ
 ed asset are substantially diﬀ
 erent. 
If the cash ﬂ
 ows are substantially diﬀ
 erent, then the contractual rights to cash ﬂ
 ows from the 
original ﬁ
 nancial asset shall be deemed to have expired. In this case, the original ﬁ
 nancial 
asset shall be derecognised and a new ﬁ
 nancial asset shall be recognised at fair value 
plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modiﬁ
 cation shall be 
accounted for as follows: 
—  Fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that 
represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs shall be included in the initial 
measurement of the asset; and 
—  Other fees are included in proﬁ
 t or loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition. 
If cash ﬂ
 ows are modiﬁ
 ed when the borrower is in ﬁ
 nancial diﬃ
  culties, then the objective 
of the modiﬁ
 cation is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather 
than to originate a new asset with substantially diﬀ
 erent terms.
If the Bank plans to modify a ﬁ
 nancial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash 
ﬂ
 ows, then it shall ﬁ
 rst consider whether a portion of the asset should be written oﬀ
  before 
the modiﬁ
 cation takes place.
Years of Success
45
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020
Where the modiﬁ
 cation of a ﬁ
 nancial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not 
result in derecognition of the ﬁ
 nancial asset, then the Bank shall ﬁ
 rst recalculate the gross 
carrying amount of the ﬁ
 nancial asset using the original eﬀ
 ective interest rate of the asset 
and recognises the resulting adjustment as a modiﬁ
 cation gain or loss in proﬁ
 t or loss. Any 
costs or fees incurred and fees receivedas part of the modiﬁ
 cation adjust the gross carrying 
amount of the modiﬁ
 ed ﬁ
 nancial asset and shall be amortised over the remaining term of 
the modiﬁ
 ed ﬁ
 nancial asset. 
Where such a modiﬁ
 cation is carried out because of ﬁ
 nancial diﬃ
  culties of the borrower, 
then the gain or loss shall be presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it 
shall be presented as interest income calculated using the eﬀ
 ective interest rate method. 
ii)  Financial liabilities 
The Bank shall derecognise a ﬁ
 nancial liability when its terms are modiﬁ
 ed and the cash 
ﬂ
 ows of the modiﬁ
 ed liability are substantially diﬀ
 erent. In this case, a new ﬁ
 nancial liability 
based on the modiﬁ
 ed terms shall be recognised at fair value. The diﬀ
 erence between the 
carrying amount of the ﬁ
 nancial liability derecognised and consideration paid is recognised 
in proﬁ
 t or loss. Consideration paid shall include non-ﬁ
 nancial assets transferred, if any, and 
the assumption of liabilities, including the new modiﬁ
 ed ﬁ
 nancial liability. 
Where the modiﬁ
 cation of a ﬁ
 nancial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the 
amortised cost of the liability shall be recalculated by discounting the modiﬁ
 ed cash ﬂ
 ows 
at the original eﬀ
 ective interest rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in proﬁ
 t or 
loss. Any costs and fees incurred are recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount 
of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modiﬁ
 ed ﬁ
 nancial liability by 
re-computing the eﬀ
 ective interest rate on the instrument. 
2.4.6
 Oﬀ
 setting
Financial assets and ﬁ
 nancial liabilities shall be oﬀ
 set and the net amount presented in 
the statement of ﬁ
 nancial position when, and only when, the Bank currently has a legally 
enforceable right to set oﬀ
  the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis 
or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
Income and expenses shall be presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS, 
or for gains and losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Bank’s 
trading activity.
2.4.7
Designation at fair value through proﬁ
 t or loss
i)  Financial assets 
At initial recognition, the Bank may designate certain ﬁ
 nancial assets as at FVTPL because 
this designation eliminates or signiﬁ
 cantly reduces an accounting mismatch, which would 
otherwise arise. 
ii)  Financial liabilities 
The Bank shall designate certain ﬁ
 nancial liabilities as at FVTPL in either of the following 
circumstances: 
—  The liabilities are managed, evaluated and reported internally on a fair value basis; or 
—  The designation eliminates or signiﬁ
 cantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would 
otherwise arise. 
2.5
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents’ include notes and coins on hand, unrestricted balances held with 
central Banks and highly liquid ﬁ
 nancial assets with original maturities of three months or 
less from the date of acquisition that are subject to an insigniﬁ
 cant risk of changes in their 
fair value, and are used by the Bank in the management of its short-term commitments.

Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortised cost in the statement of ﬁ
 nancial position.
2.6
Net trading income
Net trading income’ comprises gains less losses related to trading assets and liabilities, and 
includes all fair value changes, interest, dividends and foreign exchange diﬀ
 erences.
2.7
Property, plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the 
property, plant and equipment if the recognition criteria are met. When signiﬁ
 cant parts of 
property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Bank recognises 
such parts as individual assets with speciﬁ
 c useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. 
All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in income statement as incurred.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate 
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic beneﬁ
 ts associated 
with the item will ﬂ
 ow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The 
carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost  to their 
residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Asset class

or years)

(years)

 ed during the year.

BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020
An item of property, plant and equipment and any signiﬁ
 cant part initially recognised 
is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic beneﬁ
 ts are expected from 
its use disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated 
as the diﬀ
 erence between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the asset) is included in income statement when the asset is derecognised.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and 
equipment are reviewed at each ﬁ
 nancial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
2.8
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following 
initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangibles, excluding 
capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is reﬂ
 ected in 
income statement in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either ﬁ
 nite or indeﬁ
 nite. Intangible 
assets with ﬁ
 nite lives are amortised over the useful economic life. The amortisation period 
and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a ﬁ
 nite useful life are reviewed 
at least at each ﬁ
 nancial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life, or the expected 
pattern of consumption of future economic beneﬁ
 ts embodied in the asset, are accounted 
for by changing the amortisation period or methodology, as appropriate, which are then 
treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expenses on intangible 
assets with ﬁ
 nite lives is presented as a separate line item in the income statement.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight–line method to write down the cost of 
intangible assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives,which is 6 years.
2.9
Investment property
Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, are 
classiﬁ
 ed as investment properties.
 
Recognition of investment properties takes place only when it is probable that the future 
economic beneﬁ
 ts that are associated with the investment property will ﬂ
 ow to the Bank and 
the cost can be reliably measured.  This is usually when all risks are transferred.
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. The Bank 
has opted to subsequently carry investment property at cost and disclose fair value. Fair 
value is based on comparative market prices, adjusted if necessary, for any diﬀ
 erence in 
the nature, location or condition of the speciﬁ
 c asset. If this information is not available, 
the Bank uses alternative valuation methods, such as recent prices on less active markets 
or discounted cash ﬂ
 ow projections. Valuations are performed as of the reporting date by 
professional valuers who hold recognised and relevant professional qualiﬁ
 cations and have 
recent experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued. 
These valuations form the basis for the carrying amounts in the ﬁ
 nancial statements.

The fair value of investment property reﬂ
 ects, the near current market conditions.
The fair value of investment property does not reﬂ
 ect future capital expenditure that will 
improve or enhance the property and does not reﬂ
 ect the related future beneﬁ
 ts from this 
future expenditure other than those a rational market participant would take into account 
when determining the value of the property.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised to the asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable 
that future economic beneﬁ
 ts associated with the expenditure will ﬂ
 ow to the Bank and the 
cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are 
expensed when incurred. When part of an investment property is replaced, the carrying 
amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
Investment properties are derecognised when they have been disposed. Where the Bank 
disposes of a property at fair value in an arm’s length transaction, the carrying value 
immediately prior to the sale is adjusted to the transaction price, and the adjustment is 
recorded in the statement of changes in net assets available for beneﬁ
 t.   
2.10
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and discontinued operations
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classiﬁ
 ed as held for sale if their carrying amount 
will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use 
and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying 
amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets 
arising from employee beneﬁ
 ts, ﬁ
 nancial assets and investment property that are carried at 
fair value and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which are speciﬁ
 cally exempt 
from this requirement.
An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or 
disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases 
in fair value less costs to sell of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative 
impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of 
the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the date of derecognition.
Non-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or 
amortised while they are classiﬁ
 ed as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable 
to the liabilities of a disposal group classiﬁ
 ed as held for sale continue to be recognised.
Non-current assets classiﬁ
 ed as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classiﬁ
 ed 
as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet. The 
liabilities of a disposal group classiﬁ
 ed as held for sale are presented separately from other 
liabilities in the balance sheet.
A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classiﬁ
 ed 
as held for sale and that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area 
of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or 
area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results 
of discontinued operations are presented separately in the statement of proﬁ
 t or loss.
2.11
Impairment of non-ﬁ
 nancial assets
The Bank assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may 
be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is

49
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020
required, the Bank estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount 
is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal 
and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the 
asset does not generate cash inﬂ
 ows that are largely independent of those from other assets 
or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂ
 ows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂ
 ects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks speciﬁ
 c to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, 
recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identiﬁ
 ed, an 
appropriate 
valuation 
model 
is 
used. 
These 
calculations 
are 
corroborated 
by 
valuation 
multiples, 
quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators.
The Bank bases its impairment calculation 
on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which 
are 
prepared 
separately 
for 
each 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
CGUs 
to 
which 
the 
individual 
assets 
are 
allocated. 
These 
budgets 
and 
forecast 
calculations 
generally 
cover 
a 
period 
of 
ﬁ
 ve 
years. 
For 
longer 
periods, 
a 
long-term 
growth 
rate 
is 
calculated 
and 
applied 
to 
project 
future 
cash 
ﬂ
 ows 
after 
the 
ﬁ
 fth 
year.
For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine 
whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer 
exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Bank estimates the asset’s or CGU’s 
recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has 
been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since 
the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount 
of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised 
for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the income statement.
2.12
Other assets
Other assets are generally deﬁ
 ned as claims held against other entities for the future receipt 
of money. The other assets in the Bank’s ﬁ
 nancial statements include the following:
(a)
Prepayment
Prepayments are payments made in advance for services to be enjoyed in future. The 
amount is initially capitalized in the reporting period in which the payment is made and 
subsequently amortised over the period in which the service is to be enjoyed.
(b)
Other receivables
Other

are 
recognised 
upon 
the

of

 cant estimates and assumptions Notes 3 and   
   Note 4.7.1
• Quantitative disclosures of fair value measurement hierarchy Note 4.7.2
• Financial instruments (including those carried at amortised cost) Note 4.7.3
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in 
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value 
measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer 
the liability takes place either:
• In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
• 
 
 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
principal 
market, 
in 
the 
most 
advantageous 
market 
for 
the 
asset 
or 
liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to by the Bank.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market 
participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants 
act in their economic best interest.
The Bank uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
suﬃ
  cient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable 
inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the ﬁ
 nancial 
statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on 
the lowest level input that is signiﬁ
 cant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
• Level 1 —  Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities.
• Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is signiﬁ
 cant to the 
fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
• Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is signiﬁ
 cant to the 
fair value measurement is  unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the ﬁ
 nancial statements on a recurring 
basis, the Bank determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the 
hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is signiﬁ
 cant 
to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
The Bank’s management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair 
value measurement, such as available-for-sale ﬁ
 nancial assets.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Bank has determined classes of assets and 
liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and 
the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020
The Bank operates two deﬁ
 ned contribution plans;
i)   pension scheme in line with the provisions of Ethiopian pension of private organisation 
employees proclamation 715/2011.  Funding under the scheme is 7% and 11% by 
employees and the Bank respectively;
ii)  provident fund contribution, funding under this scheme is 6% and 12% by employees 
and the Bank respectively;
based on the employees’ salary. Employer’s contributions to this scheme are charged to 
proﬁ
 t or loss and other comprehensive income in the period in which they relate.
(b)
Deﬁ
 ned beneﬁ
 t plan
The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of deﬁ
 ned beneﬁ
 t 
pension plans is the present value of the deﬁ
 ned beneﬁ
 t obligation at the end of the 
reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The deﬁ
 ned beneﬁ
 t obligation is 
calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The liability recognised in the statement of ﬁ
 nancial position in respect of deﬁ
 ned beneﬁ
 t 
pension plans is the present value of the deﬁ
 ned beneﬁ
 t obligation at the end of the reporting 
period less the fair value of plan assets. The deﬁ
 ned beneﬁ
 t obligation is calculated annually 
by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the 
deﬁ
 ned beneﬁ
 t obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outﬂ
 ows 
using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in 
which the beneﬁ
 ts will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms 
of the related pension obligation.
The current service cost of the deﬁ
 ned beneﬁ
 t plan, recognised in the income statement 
in employee beneﬁ
 t expense, except where included in the cost of an asset, reﬂ
 ects the 
increase in the deﬁ
 ned beneﬁ
 t obligation resulting from employee service in the current 
year, beneﬁ
 t changes curtailments and settlements.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 
assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period 
in which they arise.
(c )
Termination beneﬁ
 ts
Termination beneﬁ
 ts are payable to bank employees and executive directors when 
employment is terminated by the Bank before the normal retirement date, or whenever 
an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these beneﬁ
 ts. The Bank 
recognises termination beneﬁ
 ts when it is demonstrably committed to either: terminating 
the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility 
of withdrawal; or providing termination beneﬁ
 ts as a result of an oﬀ
 er made to encourage 
voluntary redundancy.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020
The Banks recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and proﬁ
 t-sharing based on a 
formula that takes into consideration the proﬁ
 t attributable to the company’s shareholders 
after certain adjustments. The Bank recognises a provision where contractually obliged or 
where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
2.15 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) 
as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outﬂ
 ow of resources embodying economic 
beneﬁ
 ts will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of 
the amount of the obligation. When the Bank expects some or all of a provision to be 
reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised 
as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense 
relating to a provision is presented in income statement net of any reimbursement.
If the eﬀ
 ect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a 
current pre-tax rate that reﬂ
 ects, when appropriate, the risks speciﬁ
 c to the liability. When 
discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised 
as other operating expenses.
2.16 
Share capital
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options or to the 
acquisition of a business are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
2.17 
Earnings per share
The Bank presents basic earnings per share for its ordinary shares.  Basic earnings per share 
are calculated by dividing the proﬁ
 t or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Bank 
by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.

substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in Ethiopia. Management 
periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in 
which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions 
where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction aﬀ
 ects 
neither accounting nor taxable proﬁ
 t or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax 
asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable 
proﬁ
 t will be available against which the temporary diﬀ
 erences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are oﬀ
 set when there is a legally enforceable right to oﬀ
 set 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxes assets and 
liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same 
taxable entity or diﬀ
 erent taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances 
on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only oﬀ
 set when they arise in the same tax reporting 
group and where there is both the legal right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to 
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Bank Acting as a Lessee
At commencement or on modiﬁ
 cation of a contract that contains a lease component, the 
Bank allocates consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its 
relative stand-alone price.However,for leases of branchs and oﬃ
  ce premises the bank has 
elected to separet non-lease components from the space rental payment obligetions.  
The Bank recognises a right-of-use of asset and a lease liablity at the lease comencement 
date. 
The right-of- use asset is initially measured at cost,which comprises the initial amount of 
the lease liblity adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the comencement 
date,plus any initial direct costs incurred and anestimate of costs to dismantle and remove 
any improvements made to branches or oﬃ
  ce premises.  
The right-of-use asset is subsquntly deperciated using the stright-line method from the 
commencement date to the end of the lease term.in addition,the right-of-use asset is 
peredically reduced by impairment losses,if any,and adjusted for certain remesurment of 
the lease liablity
The lease liblity is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not 
paid at the commencement date,dicounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or,if 
that rate can not be readily determind,the bank’s incremental borrowing rate.Generally,The 
Bank uses its incremental borrowing rate as the dicount rate.
The  Bank determines its incremental borrowing rate by analysing its borrowings from 
various external sources and makes certain adjustments to reﬂ
 ect the terms of the lease 
and type of asset leased

The lease liablity is measured at amortised cost using the eﬀ
 ective interest method.it is 
remesured when there is achange in future lease payments arising from achange in an index 
or rate,if there  is a change in the bank’s estimate of the amount expected to be pable under 
a residual value guarantee,if the bank changes its assusment of whether it will excercise 
apurchase,extension or terminetion option or if there is revised in-substance ﬁ
 xed lease 
payment.            
When the lease liblity is remesured in this way,acorrosponding adjustment is made to the 
carring amount of the right-of-use asset,or is recorded in proﬁ
 t or loss if the carrying amount 
of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

Short-term Leases and Leases of Low-value assets
The Bank has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liblities for lease of low 
value assets and short-term leases,including leases of equpment. The bank recognises the 
leases payments associated with these leases as an expense on a staright-line basis over 
the lease term.
Bank acting as a lessor
A inception or on modiﬁ
 cation of a contract   that contans a lease component,the bank 
allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the bases of their 
relative standalone selling prices.
When the bank acts as aleaser,it determines at lease inception whether the lease is aﬁ
 nance 
leases or opereting lease.
To classify each lease,the Bank makes an overall assusment of whether the lease transfers 
substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset.if 
this is the case,then the lease is a ﬁ
 nance lease;if not,then it is an opereting lease.as part 
of this assusment,the bank considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the 
major part of the economic life of the asset.
The Bank applies the derecognition and imperment requrments in IFRS 9 to the net 
investment in the lease.the bank further regularly reviews estimeted unguaranteed residual 
values used in calculeting the gross investment in the lease.
Policy applicable before 1 July 2019
For contracts entered in to before 1 July 2019,the bank determined whether the arrangement 
was or contained a leased based on the assusment of whether:
— fulﬁ
 lment of the arrangement was dependent on the use of a speciﬁ
 c asset or assets;and
— the arrangement had conveyed aright to use the asset.
As a lessee
The bank did not have any ﬁ
 nance leases under IAS 17.
Assets held under other leases were classiﬁ
 ed as opereting leases and were not recognised 
in the bank’ statement of ﬁ
 nancial position. Payments made under opereting leases were 
recognised in proﬁ

incentives recived were recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense over the 
term of the lease.

Interest and similar income and expense
For all the government bills measured at amortised cost and interest bearing ﬁ
 nancial assets 
classiﬁ
 ed as available– for–sale interest income or expense is recorded using the Eﬀ
 ective 
Interest Rate (EIR), which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments 
or receipts through the expected life of the ﬁ
 nancial instrument or a shorter period, where 
appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the ﬁ
 nancial asset or ﬁ
 nancial liability. The 
calculation takes into account all contractual terms of the ﬁ
 nancial instrument (for example, 
prepayment options) and includes any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable 
to the instrument and are an integral part of the Eﬀ
 ective Interest Rate (EIR), but not future 
credit losses.
The carrying amount of the ﬁ
 nancial asset or ﬁ
 nancial liability is adjusted if the Bank 
revises its estimates of payments or receipts. The adjusted carrying amount is calculated 
based on the original EIR and the change in carrying amount is recorded as ‘Interest and 
similar income’ for ﬁ
 nancial assets and Interest and similar expense for ﬁ
 nancial liabilities.
Once the recorded value of a ﬁ
 nancial asset or a group of similar ﬁ
 nancial assets has been 
reduced due to an impairment loss, interest income continues to be recognised using the 
rate of interest used to discount the future cash ﬂ
 ows for the purpose of measuring the 
impairment loss.
a)
Recognition of income and expenses
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic beneﬁ
 ts will ﬂ
 ow to 
the Bank and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being 
made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, 
taking into account contractually deﬁ
 ned terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty.
The Bank, earns income from interest on  loans given for domestic trade and services, 
building and construction, manufacturing, agriculture and personal loans. Other incomes 
includes margins on letter of credits and performance guarantees.
2.22
Net interest income
a. Eﬀ
 ective interest rate and amortised cost
Interest income and expense are recognised in proﬁ
 t or loss using the eﬀ
 ective interest 
method. The ‘eﬀ
 ective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
payments or receipts through the expected life of the ﬁ
 nancial instrument to:
-  The gross carrying amount of the ﬁ
 nancial asset; or
-  The amortised cost of the ﬁ
 nancial liability.
When calculating the eﬀ
 ective interest rate for ﬁ
 nancial instruments other than credit-
impaired assets, the Bank estimates future cash ﬂ
 ows considering all contractual terms 
of the ﬁ
 nancial instrument, but not expected credit losses. For credit-impaired ﬁ
 nancial 
assets, a credit-adjusted eﬀ
 ective interest rate is calculated using estimated future cash 
ﬂ
 ows including expected credit losses.
The calculation of the eﬀ
 ective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees and points 
paid or received that are an integral part of the eﬀ
 ective interest rate. Transaction costs 
include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a ﬁ
 nancial 
asset or ﬁ
 nancial liability

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

b. Amortised cost and gross carrying amount
The ‘amortised cost’ of a ﬁ
 nancial asset or ﬁ
 nancial liability is the amount at which the 
ﬁ
 nancial asset or ﬁ
 nancial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal 
repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the eﬀ
 ective interest method 
of any diﬀ
 erence between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for ﬁ
 nancial 
assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance (or impairment allowance before 1 
July 2018). 
The ‘gross carrying amount of a ﬁ
 nancial asset’ is the amortised cost of a ﬁ
 nancial asset 
before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.
c. Calculation of interest income and expense
In calculating interest income and expense, the eﬀ
 ective interest rate is applied to the gross 
carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortised 
cost of the liability.
However, for ﬁ
 nancial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the eﬀ
 ective interest rate to the 
amortised cost of the ﬁ
 nancial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the 
calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.
For ﬁ
 nancial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest income is 
calculated by applying the credit-adjusted eﬀ
 ective interest rate to the amortised cost of the 
asset. The calculation of interest income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit 
risk of the asset improves. 
d. Presentation
Interest income and expense presented in the statement of proﬁ
 t or loss and OCI include:
-  Interest on ﬁ
 nancial assets and ﬁ
 nancial liabilities measured at amortised cost calculated

IFRS 16 - Leases
On 13 January 2016 the IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases, completing the IASB’s project to 
improve the ﬁ
 nancial reporting of leases. IFRS 16 replaces the previous leases standrads, 
IAS 17 Leases, and related interpretations.
IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presnation and discloure 
of leases for both parties to a contract, i.e. the customer (lessee’) and the supplier(‘lesssor’). 
The standrad deﬁ
 nes a lease as a contract that conveys to the customer (‘lessee’) the right 
to use an asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
A company assesses whether a contract contains a lease on the basis of whether the 
customer has the right to control the use of an identiﬁ
 ed assest for a period of time. 
The standrad eliminates the classﬁ
 cation of leases as either operating leases or ﬁ
 nance 
leases for a lessee and introduces a single lessee accounting model. All leases are treated in 
a similar way to ﬁ
 nance leases.
Applying that model signiﬁ
 cantly aﬀ

consequently, the lessee is required to recognise

IFRS 16 requires a lessor to disclouse additional information about how it manges the risks 
related to its residual interest in assests subject to leases.

are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various 
assumptions that may diﬀ
 er from actual developments in the future. These include the 
determination of the discount rate, future salary increases, mortality rates and future 
pension increases. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term 
nature, a deﬁ
 ned beneﬁ
 t obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All 
assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.

Impairment of non-ﬁ
 nancial assets
Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its 
recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in 
use. The fair value less costs of disposal calculation is based on available data from binding
sales transactions, conducted at arm’s length, for similar assets or observable market prices 
less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based 
on a DCF model. The cash ﬂ
 ows are derived from the budget for the next ﬁ
 ve years and 
do not include restructuring activities that the Bank is not yet committed to or signiﬁ
 cant 
future investments that will enhance the asset’s performance of the CGU being tested. The 
recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash ﬂ
 ow model as 
well as the expected future cash-inﬂ
 ows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. 
3.6
Taxes
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes 
in tax laws, and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range 
of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of 
existing contractual agreements, diﬀ
 erences arising between the actual results and the 
assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future 
adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. The amount of such provisions 
is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and diﬀ
 ering 
interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable proﬁ
 t will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Signiﬁ
 cant 
management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that 
can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable proﬁ
 ts 
together with future tax planning strategies.
3.7
Development cost 
The Bank capitalises development costs for a project in accordance with the accounting 
policy. Initial capitalisation of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological 
and economic feasibility is conﬁ
 rmed, usually when a product development project has 
reached a deﬁ
 ned milestone according to an established project management model. In 
determining the amounts to be capitalised, management makes assumptions regarding 
the expected future cash generation of the project, discount rates to be applied 
and the expected period of beneﬁ
 ts. The development costs that were capitalised 
by the Bank relates to those arising from the development of computer software.

Financial risk management
4.1
Introduction
Risk is inherent in the Bank’s activities, but is managed through a process of ongoing identi-
ﬁ
 cation, measurement and monitoring, subject to risk limits and other controls. This process 
of risk management is critical to the Bank’s continuing proﬁ
 tability and each individual within 
the Bank is accountable for the risk exposures relating to his or her responsibilities. The Bank 
is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. It is also subject to country risk and 
various operating risks.
The independent risk control process does not include business risks such as changes in the 
environment, technology and industry. The Bank’s policy is to monitor those business risks 
through the Bank’s strategic planning process.
4.1.1 Risk management structure
The Asset-Liability Management Committee, is responsible for the overall risk management 
approach and for approving the risk management strategies and principles. It also has the 
responsibility to monitor the overall risk process within the Bank.
The Asset-Liability Management Committee has the overall responsibility for the development 
of the risk strategy and implementing principles, frameworks, policies and limits. It is also 
responsible for managing risk decisions and monitoring risk levels and reports on a monthly 
basis to the Board risk committee.
The Credit Risk Management Committee is responsible for implementing and maintaining risk 
related procedures to ensure an independent control process is maintained. The unit works 
closely with the Management Risk Committee to ensure that procedures are compliant with 
the overall framework.
The Risk Management Unit is responsible for monitoring compliance with risk principles, policies 
and limits across the Bank. It carries out an assessment of risk on an ad hoc basis to  monitor the 
Bank’s  independent control of risks, including monitoring the risk of exposures against limits 
and the assessment of risks of new products and structured transactions. This unit also ensures 
the complete capture of the risks in risk measurement and reporting systems. Exceptions are 
reported, where necessary, to the Risk Management Committee, and further to the Board Risk 
Committee and the relevant actions are taken to address exceptions and any areas of weakness.
Bank Treasury operation is responsible for managing the Bank’s ﬁ
 nancial assets, ﬁ
 nancial 
liabilities and the overall ﬁ
 nancial structure. It is also primarily responsible for the funding and 
liquidity risks of the Bank.
The Bank’s policy is that risk management processes throughout the Bank are audited annually 
by the Internal Audit function, which examines both the adequacy of the procedures and the 
Bank’s compliance with the procedures. Internal Audit Function discusses the results of all 
assessments with management, and reports its ﬁ
 ndings and recommendations to the Board 
Audit Committee.
4.1.2 Risk measurement and reporting systems
"The Bank’s risks are measured using a method that reﬂ
 ects both the expected loss likely to arise 
in normal circumstances and unexpected losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss 
based on statistical models. The models make use of probabilities derived from historical

experience, adjusted to reﬂ
 ect the economic environment. The Bank also runs worst-case scenarios 
that would arise in the event that extreme events which are unlikely to occur do, in fact, occur.
Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily performed based on limits established by the Bank. 
These limits reﬂ
 ect the business strategy and market environment of the Bank as well as the level 
of risk that the Bank is willing to accept, with additional emphasis on selected regions. In addition, 
the Bank’s policy is to measure and monitor the overall risk bearing capacity in relation to the 
aggregate risk exposure across all risk types and activities." 
 
4.1.3 Risk mitigation
Risk controls and mitigants, identiﬁ
 ed and approved for the Bank, are documented for existing 
and new  processes and systems.
The adequacy of these mitigants is tested on a periodic basis through administration of 
control self-assessment questionnaires, using an operational risk management tool which 
requires risk owners to conﬁ
 rm the eﬀ
 ectiveness of established controls. These are subse-
quently audited as part of the review process.
4.2
Financial instruments by category 
The Bank’s ﬁ
 nancial assets are classiﬁ
 ed into the following measurement categories: avail-
able-for-sale and loans and receivables and the ﬁ
 nancial liabilities are classiﬁ
 ed into other 
liabilities at amortised cost.
Financial instruments are classiﬁ
 ed in the statement of ﬁ
 nancial position in accordance with 
their legal form and substance. 
The Bank’s classiﬁ
 cation of its ﬁ
 nancial assets is summarised in the table below:

4.3.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁ
 nancial loss to the Bank if a customer or counterparty to a ﬁ
 nancial 
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Bank’s 
loans and advances to customers and other banks and other ﬁ
 nancial assets.
Exposure to credit risk is managed through periodic analysis of the ability of borrowers and 
potential borrowers to determine their capacity to meet principal and interest thereon, and 
restructuring such limits as appropriate. Exposure to credit risk is also mitigated, in part, by 
obtaining collateral, commercial and personal guarantees.
The Bank structures the levels of credit risk it undertakes by placing limits on the amount of 
risk accepted in relation to one borrower, or groups of borrowers, and to term of the ﬁ
 nancial 
instrument and economic sectors.
The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) sets credit risk limit for a single borrower, one related 
party and all related parties to not exceed 25%, 15% and 35% of Bank’s total capital amount 
as of the reporting quarterly period respectively.
Credit management is conducted as per the risk management policy and guideline approved 
by the board of directors and the Risk Management Committees. Such policies are reviewed 
and modiﬁ
 ed periodically based on changes and expectations of the markets where the Bank 
operates, regulations, and other factors.

 nancial assets meas-

            i)  Loans and advances to corporate customers
The general creditworthiness of a corporate customer tends to be the most relevant indicator 
of credit quality of a loan extended to it. However, collateral provides additional security and 
the Bank generally requests that corporate borrowers provide it. The Bank may take collateral 
in the form of a ﬁ
 rst charge over real estate, ﬂ
 oating charges over all corporate assets and 
other liens and guarantees.
Because of the Bank’s focus on corporate customers’ creditworthiness, the Bank does not 
routinely update the valuation of collateral held against all loans to corporate customers. Valu-
ation of collateral is updated when the loan is put on a watch list and the loan is monitored 
more closely. For credit-impaired loans, the Bank obtains appraisals of collateral because it 
provides input into determining the management credit risk actions.
ii)  Investment securities designated as at FVTPL
At 30 June 2020, the Bank had no exposure to credit risk of the investment securities desig-
nated as at FVTPL

Amounts arising from ECL
i)  Inputs, assumptions and techniques used for estimating impairment
See accounting policy in Note 2.5.1.(c)
ii)  Signiﬁ
 cant increase in credit risk
When determining whether the risk of default on a ﬁ
 nancial instrument has increased signiﬁ
 -
cantly since initial recognition, the Bank considers reasonable and supportable information 
that is relevant and available without undue cost or eﬀ
 ort. This includes both quantitative 
and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Bank’s historical experience and expert 
credit assessment and including forward-looking information.
The objective of the assessment is to identify whether a signiﬁ
 cant increase in credit risk has 
occurred for an exposure by comparing:
—  the remaining lifetime probability of default (PD) as at the reporting date; with
—  the remaining lifetime PD for this point in time that was estimated at the time of initial 
recognition of the exposure (adjusted where relevant for changes in prepayment expec-
tations).
—  the Bank uses three criteria for determining whether there has been a signiﬁ
 cant in-
crease in credit risk:
—  quantitative test based on movement in PD;
—  qualitative indicators; and
—  a backstop of 30 days past due,
iii)    Credit risk grades
The Bank allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on a variety of data that is 
determined to be predictive of the risk of default and applying experienced credit judgement. 
Credit risk grades are deﬁ
 ned using qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of 
risk of default. These factors vary depending on the nature of the exposure and the type of 
borrower.
Credit risk grades are deﬁ
 ned and calibrated such that the risk of default occurring increases 
exponentially as the credit risk deteriorates so, for example, the diﬀ
 erence in risk of default 
between credit risk grades 1 and 2 is smaller than the diﬀ
 erence between credit risk grades 2 
and 3. Each exposure is allocated to a credit risk grade on initial recognition based on avail-
able information about the borrower. Exposures are subject to ongoing monitoring, which may 
result in an exposure being moved to a diﬀ
 erent credit risk grade. The monitoring typically 
involves use of the following data;
a.  Term loan exposures
— Information obtained during periodic review of customer ﬁ
 les – e.g. audited ﬁ
 nancial 
statements, management accounts, budgets and projections. Examples of areas of par-
ticular focus are: gross proﬁ
 t margins, ﬁ
 nancial leverage ratios, debt service coverage, 
compliance
— Data from credit reference agencies, press articles, changes in external credit ratings
— Actual and expected signiﬁ
 cant changes in the political, regulatory and technological en-
vironment of the borrower or in its business activities
— Internally collected data on customer behaviour – e.g. utilisation of credit card facilities
— Aﬀ
 ordability metrics

BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020
b.  Overdraft exposures
—  Payment record – this includes overdue status as well as a     
     range of variables about payment ratios
—  Utilisation of the granted limit
—  Requests for and granting of forbearance
—  Existing and forecast changes in business, ﬁ
 nancial and eco-
nomic conditions
iv)  Generating the term structure of PD
Credit risk grades are a primary input into the determination of the term structure of PD 
for exposures. The Bank collects performance and default information about its credit risk 
exposures analysed by type of product and borrower as well as by credit risk grading. The 
Bank employs statistical models to analyse the data collected and generate estimates of the 
remaining lifetime PD of exposures and how these are expected to change as a result of the 
passage of time.
v)  Determining whether credit risk has increased signiﬁ
 cantly
The Bank assesses whether credit risk has increased signiﬁ
 cantly since initial recognition at 
each reporting date. Determining whether an increase in credit risk is signiﬁ
 cant depends on 
the characteristics of the ﬁ
 nancial instrument and the borrower. What isconsidered signiﬁ
 cant 
diﬀ
 ers for diﬀ
 erent types of lending.
The credit risk may also be deemed to have increased signiﬁ
 cantly since initial recognition 
based on qualitative factors linked to the Bank’s credit risk management processes that may 
not otherwise be fully reﬂ
 ected in its quantitative analysis on a timely basis. This will be the 
case for exposures that meet certain heightened risk criteria, such as placement on a watch 
list. Such qualitative factors are based on its expert judgment and relevant historical experi-
ences.
As a backstop, the Bank considers that a signiﬁ
 cant increase in credit risk occurs no later than 
when an asset is more than 30 days past due. Days past due are determined by counting the 
number of days since the earliest elapsed due date in respect of which full payment has not 
been received. Due dates are determined without considering any grace period that might be 
available to the borrower.
If there is evidence that there is no longer a signiﬁ
 cant increase in credit risk relative to initial 
recognition, then the loss allowance on an instrument returns to being measured as 12-month 
ECL. Some qualitative indicators of an increase in credit risk, such as delinquency or forbear-
ance, may be indicative of an increased risk of default that persists after the indicator itself 
has ceased to exist. In these cases, the Bank determines a probation period during which the 
ﬁ
 nancial asset is required to demonstrate good behaviour to provide evidence that its credit 
risk has declined suﬃ
  ciently. When contractual terms of a loan have been modiﬁ
 ed, evidence 
that the criteria for recognising lifetime ECL are no longer met includes a history of up-to-date 
payment performance against the modiﬁ
 ed contractual terms. 
The Bank monitors the eﬀ
 ectiveness of the criteria used to identify signiﬁ
 cant increases in 
credit risk by regular reviews to conﬁ
 rm that:
-  the criteria are capable of identifying signiﬁ
 cant increases in credit risk before an expo-
sure is in default;
Years of Success
69
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020
-  the criteria do not align with the point in time when an asset becomes 30 days past due;
-  the average time between the identiﬁ
 cation of a signiﬁ
 cant increase in credit risk and 
default appears reasonable;
-  exposures are not generally transferred directly from 12-month ECL measurement to 
credit- impaired; and
- there is no unwarranted volatility in loss allowance from transfers between 12-month PD 
(Stage 1) and lifetime PD (Stage 2).
vi)  Deﬁ
 nition of default
The Bank considers a ﬁ
 nancial asset to be in default when:
-  the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank in full, without recourse 
by the Bank to actions such as realising security (if any is held);
-  the borrower is more than 90 days past due on any material credit obligation to the 
Bank.
-  Overdrafts are considered as being past due once the customer has breached an advised 
limit or been advised of a limit smaller than the current amount outstanding; or
-  it is becoming probable that the borrower will restructure the asset as a result of 
bankruptcy due to the borrower’s inability to pay its credit obligations.
In assessing whether a borrower is in default, the Bank considers indicators that are:
-  qualitative: e.g. breaches of covenant;
-  quantitative: e.g. overdue status and non-payment on another obligation of the same 
issuer to the Bank; and
-  based on data developed internally and obtained from external sources.
-  Inputs into the assessment of whether a ﬁ
 nancial instrument is in default and their sig-
niﬁ
 cance may vary over time to reﬂ
 ect changes in circumstances.
The deﬁ
 nition of default largely aligns with that applied by the Bank for regulatory capital 
purposes 
vii)   Incorporation of forward-looking information
The Bank incorporates forward-looking information into both the assessment of whether the 
credit risk of an instrument has increased signiﬁ
 cantly since its initial recognition and the 
measurement of ECL.

median scenario, and two less likely scenarios, one upside and one downside. For each sector, 
the base case is aligned with the macroeconomic model’s information value output, a measure 
of the predictive power of the model, as well as base macroeconomic projections for identiﬁ
 ed 
macroeconomic variables for each sector. The upside and downside scenarios are based on a 
combination of a percentage error factor of each sector model as well as simulated optimistic 
and pessimistic macroeconomic projections based on a measure of historical macroeconomic 
volatilities.
In line with the expected, as well as experienced, Expected Credit Loss forward - looking 
volatility arising from the economic impact of the Covid 19 global crisis, the Bank has con-
ducted, and overlaid, additional scenario analysis on the macroeconomic overlay model. This 
includes application of higher probability weights on the downside scenario, lower probability 
weights on the upside scenario, as well as stress tests on macroeconomic projections. The 
Bank continues to monitor the economic impact of Covid 19 on it’s credit risk proﬁ
 le as well 
as forward - looking Expected Credit Loss estimates and shall update the same on it’s IFRS 
9 forward - looking estimates as and when signiﬁ
 cant changes in the overall macroeconomic 
environment are experienced.
External information considered includes economic data and forecasts published by Business 
Monitor International, an external and independent macroeconomic data body. This is in ad-
dition to industry – level, semi – annual NPL trends across statistically comparable sectors.
Periodically, the Bank carries out stress testing of more extreme shocks to calibrate its de-
termination of the upside and downside representative scenarios. A comprehensive review is 
performed at least annually on the design of the scenarios by a panel of experts that advises 
the Bank’s senior management.
The Bank has identiﬁ
 ed and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for each 
portfolio of ﬁ
 nancial instruments and, using an analysis of historical data, has estimated rela-
tionships between macro-economic variables and credit risk and credit losses.
The key drivers for credit risk for each of the Bank’s economic sectors is summarized

The economic scenarios used as at 30 June 2020 included the following key indicators for Ethiopia 
for the years 2020 to 2022
Predicted relationships between the key indicators and default rates on various portfolios of ﬁ
 nancial assets 
have been developed based on analysing semi – annual historical data over the past 5 years.
viii) Modiﬁ
 ed ﬁ
 nancial assets
The contractual terms of a loan may be modiﬁ
 ed for a number of reasons, including changing market 
conditions, customer retention and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of 
the customer. An existing loan whose terms have been modiﬁ
 ed may be derecognised and the renegotiated 
loan recognised as a new loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy set out. 
 
 
 
 
When the terms of a ﬁ
 nancial asset are modiﬁ
 ed and the modiﬁ
 cation does not result in derecognition, 
the determination of whether the asset’s credit risk has increased signiﬁ
 cantly reﬂ
 ects comparison of: its 
remaining lifetime PD at the reporting date based on the modiﬁ
 ed terms; withthe remaining lifetime PD 
estimated based on data on initial recognition and the original contractual terms.  
 
 
 
When modiﬁ
 cation results in derecognition, a new loan is recognised and allocated to Stage 1 (assuming it 
is not credit-impaired at that time).

BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020
The Bank renegotiates loans to customers in ﬁ
 nancial diﬃ
  culties (referred to as ‘forbearance 
activities’) to maximise collection opportunities and minimise the risk of default. Under the Bank’s 
forbearance policy, loan forbearance is granted on a selective basis if the debtor is currently in 
default on its debt or if there is a high risk of default, there is evidence that the debtor made all 
reasonable eﬀ
 orts to pay under the original contractual terms and the debtor is expected to be able 
to meet the revised terms.
The revised terms usually include extending the maturity, changing the timing of interest 
payments and amending the terms of loan covenants. Both retail and corporate loans are 
subject to the forbearance policy. The Bank Credit Committee regularly reviews reports on 
forbearance activities.
For ﬁ
 nancial assets modiﬁ
 ed as part of the Bank’s forbearance policy, the estimate of PD 
reﬂ
 ects whether the modiﬁ
 cation has improved or restored the Bank’s ability to collect inter-
est and principal and the Bank’s previous experience of similar forbearance action. As part of 
this process, the Bank evaluates the borrower’s payment performance against the modiﬁ
 ed 
contractual terms and considers various behavioural indicators.
Generally, forbearance is a qualitative indicator of a signiﬁ
 cant increase in credit risk and an 
expectation of forbearance may constitute evidence that an exposure is credit-impaired. A 
customer needs to demonstrate consistently good payment behaviour over a period of time 
before the exposure is no longer considered to be credit-impaired/in default or the PD is 
considered to have decreased such that the loss allowance reverts to being measured at an 
amount equal to Stage 1.
ix)  Measurement of ECL
The key inputs into the measurement of ECL are the term structure of the following variables:
-  probability of default (PD);
-  loss given default (LGD); and
-  exposure at default (EAD).
ECL for exposures in Stage 1 is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD by LGD and EAD. 
Lifetime ECL is calculated by multiplying the lifetime PD by LGD and EAD.
The methodology of estimating PDs is discussed above under the heading ‘Generating the 
term structure of PD’.
LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Bank estimates LGD param-
eters based on the history of recovery rates of claims against defaulted counterparties. The 
LGD models consider the structure, collateral, seniority of the claim, counterparty industry 
and recoverycosts of any collateral that is integral to the ﬁ
 nancial asset. 
EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Bank derives the EAD 
from the current exposure to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount 
allowed under the contract and arising from amortisation. The EAD of a ﬁ
 nancial asset is its 
gross carrying amount at the time of default. For lending commitments, the EADs are po-
tential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated based on 
historical observationsand forward-looking forecasts. For ﬁ
 nancial guarantees, the EAD repre-
sents the amount of the guaranteed exposure when the ﬁ
 nancial guarantee becomes payable. 
For some ﬁ
 nancial assets, EAD is determined by modelling the range of possible exposure 
outcomes at various points in time using scenario and statistical techniques.

BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020
As described above, and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for Stage 1 ﬁ
 nancial 
assets, the Bank measures ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual 
period (including any borrower’s extension options) over which it is exposed to credit risk, 
even if, for credit risk management purposes, the Bank considers a longer period. 
The maximum contractual period extends to the date at which the Bank has the right to re-
quire repayment of an advance or terminate a loan commitment or guarantee.
However, for overdrafts that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment component, the 
Bank measures ECL over a period longer than the maximum contractual period if the Bank’s 
contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit 
the Bank’s exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period. These facilities do not 
have a ﬁ
 xed term or repayment structure and are managed on a collective basis. The Bank 
can cancel them with immediate eﬀ
 ect but this contractual right is not enforced in the normal 
day-to-day management, but only when the Bank becomes aware of an increasein credit risk 
at the facility level. This longer period is estimated taking into account the credit risk manage-
ment actions that the Bank expects to take, and that serve to mitigate ECL. These include a 
reduction in limits, cancellation of the facility and/or turning the outstanding balance into a 
loan with ﬁ
 xed repayment terms. 
Where modelling of a parameter is carried out on a collective basis, the ﬁ
 nancial instruments 
are grouped on the basis of shared risk characteristics that include:
-  instrument type;
-  credit risk grading;
-  collateral type;
-  LTV ratio for retail mortgages;
-  date of initial recognition;
-  remaining term to maturity;
-  industry; and
-  geographic location of the borrower.
The groupings are subject to regular review to ensure that exposures within a particular group 
remain appropriately homogeneous.

Collateral held and their ﬁ

 ect
The general creditworthiness of a customer tends to be the most relevant indicator of credit 
quality of a loan extended to it. However, collateral provides additional security and the Bank 
generally requests that corporate borrowers provide it. Staﬀ
  loans are secured to the extent 
of the employee’s continued employment in the Bank.

The Bank may take collateral in the form of a ﬁ
 rst charge over real estate, liens and guaran-
tees. The Bank does not sell or repledge the collateral in the absence of default by the owner 
of the collateral. In addition to the Bank’s focus on creditworthiness, the Bank aligns with its 
credit policy guide to periodically update the validation of collaterals held against all loans to 
customers. 
For impaired loans, the Bank obtains appraisals of collateral because the fair value of the col-
lateral is an input to the impairment measurement.
The fair value of the collaterals are based on the last revaluations carried out by the Bank’s 
in-house engineers. The valuation technique adopted for properties is in line with the Bank’s 
valuation manual and the revalued amount is similar to fair values of properties with similar 
size and location.
The fair value of collaterals other than properties such as share certiﬁ
 cates, cash, NBE bills 
etc.  as disclosed at the carrying amount as management is of the opinion that the cost of 
the process of establishing the fair value of the collateral exceeds beneﬁ
 ts accruable from the 
exercise. 
4.4.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that  the Bank cannot meet its maturing obligations when they become 
due, at reasonable cost and in a timely manner. Liquidity risk arises because of the possibility 
that the Bank might be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due as a result 
of mismatches in the timing of the cash ﬂ
 ows under both normal and stress circumstances. 
Such scenarios could occur when funding needed for illiquid asset positions is not available to 
the Bank on acceptable terms.
Liquidity risk management in the Bank is solely determined by Asset-Liability Management 
Committee, which bears the overall responsibility for liquidity risk. The main objective of the 
Bank’s liquidity risk framework is to maintain suﬃ
  cient liquidity in order to ensure that we 
meet our maturing obligations.
4.4.1 Management of liquidity risk
Cash ﬂ
 ow forecasting is performed by the ﬁ
 nance department. The ﬁ
 nance department moni-
tors rolling forecasts of liquidity requirements to ensure it has suﬃ
  cient cash to meet opera-
tional needs. 
The Bank has incurred indebtedness in the form of borrowings. The Bank evaluates its ability 
to meet its obligations on an ongoing basis. Based on these evaluations, the Bank devises 
strategies to manage its liquidity risk.
Prudent liquidity risk management implies that suﬃ
  cient cash is maintained and that suﬃ
  cient 
funding is available to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed condi-
tions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk damage to the Bank’s reputation. 
4.4.2 Maturity analysis of ﬁ
 nancial liabilities

 nancial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based 
on the remaining period at the statement of ﬁ
 nancial position date to the contractual maturity 
date. The cash ﬂ
 ows presented are the undiscounted amounts to be settled in future.

Market risk
Market risk is deﬁ
 ned as the risk of loss risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂ
 ows of a ﬁ
 -
nancial instrument will ﬂ
 uctuate because of changes in market risk factors  such as interest 
rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads and their volatilities. Market risk 
can arise in conjunction with trading and non-trading activities of a ﬁ
 nancial institutions. 
The Bank does not ordinarily engage in trading activities as there are no active markets in 
Ethiopia. 
4.5.1.
Management of market risk
The main objective of Market Risk Management is to manage and control market risk exposures 
within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
4.5.2.
Management of market risk
Market risk is monitored by the risk management department on regularly, to identify any adverse 
movement in the underlying variables.
(i)
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a ﬁ
 nancial instrument will be aﬀ
 ected by changes 
in market interest rates. Borrowings obtained at variable rates give rise to interest rate risk. 
The Bank’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the 
Bank’s obligations and ﬁ
 nancial assets with ﬂ
 oating interest rates. The Bank is also exposed 
on ﬁ
 xed rate ﬁ
 nancial assets and ﬁ
 nancial liabilities. The Bank’s investment portfolio is com-
prised of treasury bills, loans and receivables and cash deposits.

Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂ
 ows of a ﬁ
 nancial instru-
ment will ﬂ
 uctuate due to the changes in foreign exchange rates. 
The Bank is exposed to exchange rate risks to the extent of balances and transac-
tions denominated in a currency other than the Ethiopian Birr. The Bank’s foreign cur-
rency bank accounts act as a natural hedge for these transactions. Management has set 
up a policy  to manage the Bank’s foreign exchange risk against its functional currency.
The table below summarises the impact of increases/decreases of 10% on equity and proﬁ
 t 
or loss arising from the Bank’s foreign denominated borrowings and cash and bank balances.
The total foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities exposed to risk as at year end 
was Birr 493 million as fcy liability (30 June 2019: Birr 220.33 million).

Capital management
The Bank’s objectives when managing capital are to comply with the capital requirements set 
by the National Bank of Ethiopia, safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, and to 
maintain a strong capital base  so as to maintain investor, creditor and market conﬁ
 dence and 
to sustain future development of the business.  
4.6.1.
Capital adequacy ratio
The capital adequacy ratio is the quotient of the capital base of the Bank and the Bank’s risk 
weighted asset base. The Bank’s capital is divided into two tiers:
-  Tier 1 capital  includes share capital, retained earnings and deductions for intangible as-
sets, and other regulatory adjustments relating to items that are included in equity but are 
treated diﬀ
 erently for capital adequacy purposes. Regulatory risk reserve is not recognised 
as a component of qualifying capital . However, any balance, should be netted oﬀ
  against 
the total risk weighted assets (RWA).
- Tier 2 capital  includes  qualifying subordinated liabilities and certain provisions for loan 
losses that are presently unidentiﬁ
 ed on an individual basis.

Fair value of ﬁ
 nancial assets and liabilities
IFRS 13 requires an entity to classify measured or disclosed fair values according to a hierar-
chy that reﬂ
 ects the signiﬁ
 cance of observable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the ﬁ
 nancial state-
ments are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, which comprises of three levels as de-
scribed below, based on the lowest level input that is signiﬁ
 cant to the fair value measurement 
as a whole.
4.7.1.
Valuation models
IFRS 13 speciﬁ
 es a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those 
valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable input reﬂ
 ect market data 
obtained from independent sources; unobservable inputs reﬂ
 ect the Bank’s market assump-
tions.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the ﬁ
 nancial state-
ments are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the low-
est level input that is signiﬁ
 cant to the fair value measurement as a whole.
84 |  Bank of Abyssinia S.C      Annual Report 2019/20
BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020
● Level 1: Inputs that are quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities.
● Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) . 
This category includes instruments valued using: quoted market prices in active markets 
for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that 
are considered less than active, or other valuation technique in which all signiﬁ
 cant inputs 
are directly or indirectly observable from market data.
    In conclusion, this category is for valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that 
is signiﬁ
 cant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
● Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data 
(unobservable inputs). This category includes all assets and liabilities for which the valua-
tion technique includes inputs not based on observable date and the unobservable inputs 
have a signiﬁ
 cant eﬀ
 ect on the asset or liability’s valuation. This category includes instru-
ments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments for which signiﬁ
 cant 
unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reﬂ
 ect diﬀ
 erences between the 
instruments.

Fair value measurement of the Bank's Investment properties
The Bank's investment property is measured at cost. These properties include those held for rental 
purposes and those in which the Bank occupies an insigniﬁ
 cant portion. These properties are held 
to earn rentals  and for capital appreciation. There are currently no restrictions on the realisability 
of these properties.
Investment property is initially measured at cost including transaction costs and subsequently meas-
ured at depreciated cost (less any accumulated impairment losses). Depreciation is calculated using 
the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful 
lives of 50 years. The fair value of investment properties  has been disclosed as required.
The fair value of the Bank's Investment property as at June 30,2016 and has been arrived at by 
in-house engineers qualiﬁ
 ed estate surveyors and reviewed and approved by independent valuers. 
These valuers have appropriate qualiﬁ
 cations and recent experience in the valuation of properties 
in the relevant locations. 
The fair value was determined based on the replacement cost concept which approximates the esti-
mated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between knowledge-
able willing parties in an arm's length transaction after proper marketing, prudently and without 
compulsion.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020
This implies a market comparable approach that reﬂ
 ects the recent transaction prices for similar 
properties). In estimating the fair value of the properties, the highest and best use of the properties 
is their current use. There has been no change to the valuation technique during the year.

 t’s level (monthly sal-
ary) and number of years in service and is calculated as 1 month salary for the ﬁ
 rst year in employ-
ment plus 1/3 of monthly salary for each subsequent in employment to a maximum of 12 months 
ﬁ
 nal monthly salary.

Withdrawal from Service
The withdrawal rates are believed to be reasonably representative of the Ethiopian experience. The 
valuation assumed a rate of withdrawal of 10% at the youngest ages falling with increasing age to 
2.5% at age 44.
The sensitivity of the overall deﬁ
 ned beneﬁ

tion is:

The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assump-
tions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be 
correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the deﬁ
 ned beneﬁ
 t obligation to signiﬁ
 cant actuarial 
assumptions the same method (present value of the deﬁ
 ned beneﬁ
 t obligation calculated with the 
projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculat-
ing the pension liability recognised within the statement of ﬁ
 nancial position.
There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis 
from prior years. The average duration of the severance pay plan at the end of the reporting period 
is 2.78 years

The Regulatory risk reserve is a non-distributable reserves required by the regulations of the Na-
tional Bank of Ethiopia(NBE) to be kept for impairment losses on loans and receivables in excess of 
IFRS charge as derived using the incurred loss model.
Where the loan loss impairment determined using the  National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) guidelines is 
higher than the loan loss impairment determined using the incurred loss model under IFRS, the dif-
ference is transferred to regulatory risk reserve and it is non-distributable to the owners of the Bank.

Where the loan loss impairment determined using the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) guidelines 
is less than the loan loss impairment determined using the incurred loss model under IFRS, the dif-
ference is transferred from regulatory risk reserve to the retained earning to the extent of the non-
distributable reserve previously recognised.
Where the 70% of suspended interest income kept under this regulatory reserve account until the

cases as at 30 June 2020 is Birr 2.2 million (30 June 2019: Birr 2.2 million). No provision has been

conducts 
business 
involving 
performance

are 
given 
as 
a 
security 
to 
support 
the
