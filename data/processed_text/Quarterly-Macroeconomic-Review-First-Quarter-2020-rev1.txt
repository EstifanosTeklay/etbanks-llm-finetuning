SUMMARY: Recent Developments and Year-Ahead Outlook
With the corona pandemic entering Ethiopia in March 2020, macroeconomic 
policies and priorities this past quarter have shifted sharply towards emergency 
economic measures that support large-scale public health interventions and limit 
damage to the real economy. Encouragingly, the corona virus spread in Ethiopia 
has so far been limited, with around 300 cases and 5 deaths as of mid-May and the 
lowest reported count among the world’s most populous nations. Looking ahead, 
as the Government’s disease prevention work is quite extensive and being 
intensified even further, we continue to expect that the current ‘limited virus 
spread scenario’ will remain for the period ahead. On this basis, we still see the 
most adverse economic shocks largely confined to four sub-sectors (hospitality, 
exports, manufacturers, and banks) whose weight in the Ethiopian economy is 
much lower than is the case in most peer countries. Moreover, as a large economic 
stimulus package is now in place and substantial foreign assistance (including debt 
relief) likely forthcoming, we think the overall negative macro impacts will not be 
as severe as may have been initially anticipated under some worst-case scenarios.
Recent Developments:1 
Growth and Activity Indicators: For the period up to end-March 2020, activity 
indicators were largely positive and suggested a strong growth outturn for the 
fiscal year prior to the onset of the Corona virus. In particular, a sampling of 
economic activity indicators as of March 2020 showed 7 percent real growth in 
tax collections (26 percent in nominal terms), 4 percent real growth in 
government capital expenditure (22 percent in nominal terms), 5 percent 
growth in fuel consumption, 14 percent real growth in bank lending, 20 percent 
real growth in ECX commodity trades,  33 percent growth in industrial park 
exports, and 26 percent growth in industrial park employment. In contrast to the 
above, areas that showed weakness included electricity power generation 
(down 8 percent), FDI inflows (down 25 percent) and tourist arrivals (down 4 
percent even as of end-March 2020). As trends in tax collections and bank 
lending often do well in capturing the pulse of on-going economic activity, and 
given the already registered agricultural growth of more than 4 percent from the 
end-2019 harvest, a high single-digit growth outturn was a likely and realistic 
prospect based on the first nine months of the fiscal year.

excluding Corona-related impacts. See next section for the outlook in Q2 2020 and beyond.

Investment: Indicators of investment activity just prior to the corona 
outbreak were somewhat mixed, with negative outturns in some areas such 
as FDI but positive (though declining) growth rates in other areas. The main 
weak area continued to be seen in FDI inflows, which were down about 25 
percent in the first half of the fiscal year vs year-ago levels ($1.8bn vs $1.4bn). 
Other investment indicators showed growth in areas such as capital goods 
imports (up 5 percent excluding lumpy aircraft imports), state enterprise 
borrowing (up 12 percent and indicative of SOE capital expenditures), and in 
government capital expenditure, which reached Birr 52bn in the first six 
months of the fiscal year, or growth of 22 percent vs same period last year.  
Overall, considering that FDI is only around 10 percent of total investment, 
the data suggest that aggregate investment was likely growing moderately in 
nominal terms but shrinking somewhat relative to GDP.
Inflation: Contrary to our expectations, inflation has not declined since the 
start of 2020 and stood at 22.9 percent (year-on-year) as of April 2020. 
Inflation has now remained above 20 percent for six consecutive months. 
Moreover, though previously confined mostly to food items (particularly 
cereal crops), it has now also spread to non-food items (e.g. beverages, 
transport) and to services (housing and utilities)—both of which are showing 
inflation of near 20 percent.  Looking into the latest monthly data from April 
2020, three specific line-items with a combined weight of nearly 50 percent 
are the biggest contributors, mainly cereal crops (prices up 31 percent), 
vegetables (up 24 percent), and housing/utilities (up 26 percent); had these 
three items shown no price increases, overall inflation would have been only 
9.9 percent. In some areas, administrative policy changes are contributing to 
inflation: for example, excise taxes on beer raised beverages inflation by 20 
percent in just the past two months and by 27 percent year-on-year; 
electricity bill adjustments are still feeding into higher inflation for the 
housing/utilities line-item; and taxi fare hikes in April (to adhere to social 
distancing rules) appear to have contributed to a large (12%) month-on-
month increase in transport prices.  However, as the latter three items have 
small weights in the overall inflation index, such administrative-related 
factors cannot be taken as the dominant source of inflation. Instead, the 
underlying sources of inflation (which we’ve previously viewed as largely 
emanating from supply-side shocks) now appear to reflect a broader 
combination of factors, including: (1) continued supply side shocks for 
foodstuffs such as cereals and vegetables (i.e. reduced output in some cases 
as well as insufficient transport to urban areas in other cases); (2) possibly 
entrenched public expectations (if farmers/traders have come to expect ever-
rising prices and thus hold back on available supplies), and (3) a macro policy 
stance that apparently was not sufficiently tight (as seems to be suggested by 
the spread of inflation to services and non-food items and reflecting perhaps  
lagged effects of the stance of policies in mid- to late-2019).

Monetary policy:  Growth in broad money supply has fallen to 19 percent 
(year-on-year), which is one of the slowest increases seen in many quarters. 
The growth rate was well below nominal GDP growth and inflation, pointing 
to a decline of money supply in real terms. Looking only at trends in the most 
recent quarters, one sees an even sharper decline in the growth of money 
supply measures—with broad money, reserve money, and net credit to 
government all up only 11 to 13 percent in the first nine months of the fiscal 
year. While data for upcoming months will no doubt show a substantial 
loosening, the pre-corona monetary policy trajectory was clearly moving 
towards significant restraint, reflecting more determined policy efforts to 
control inflation since the beginning of 2020.   
Banking developments: In line with slowing monetary growth, banks showed 
somewhat slower (though still-strong) rates of deposit and lending growth 
this past quarter. At Birr 990 billion as of March 2020, total deposits were 18 
percent higher than a year earlier and just on the verge of crossing Birr 1 
trillion. Lending levels (excluding bonds) reached Birr 567 bn as of March 
2020, an increase of 32 percent from year-ago levels (and an even higher 
increase of 38 percent if looking just at private banks). Total financing 
provided by the banking system (loans plus banks’ holdings of corporate 
bonds and NBE Bills) reached an estimated Birr 980bn at end March 2020, 
equivalent to 99 percent of total banking system deposits and indicative of 
the tight liquidity position at many private banks at the beginning of the year. 
As has been the case for several quarters now, the private sector continued 
to be the main beneficiary of recent lending growth, with Birr 212bn of the 
Birr 262bn credit increase over the past year (roughly 80 percent) going to 
private borrowers as opposed to Government or SOEs. Indeed, new SOE 
borrowing via bonds has essentially come to a stop, with their outstanding 
bond issues essentially flat at Birr 341bn as of December 2019 vs Birr 339bn 
at June 2019.  In terms of other banking indicators, the sector registered 23 
percent growth in assets, 12 percent growth in capital (to Birr 80bn), and 18 
percent growth in branches (to 5,875 nation-wide branches as of March 2020 
or an increase of around 900 branches in just the past year). For the large 
state bank, CBE, activity indicators were showing a moderation in growth 
trends, with deposits only up 15 percent and lending up 25 percent from year-
ago levels.  By contrast, private banks have collectively been expanding their 
lending at a rapid rate, or by 37 percent from year-ago levels.  Boosted by 
these trends, first nine-month profits at the 16 private banks were up around 
43 percent from year-ago levels, though all of this reflects pre-corona 
developments.
Fiscal policy: Revenue performance continues to be positive and indeed 
showed record-breaking collections in the first nine months of the fiscal year: 
tax receipts reached Birr 183bn as of March 2020, or a 29 percent jump from 
year-ago levels. Taxes on domestic activity showed more modest growth of 
just 13 percent, but this was offset by large increases in trade taxes (up 45

4
percent), boosted in part by the depreciated exchange rate which increases 
the Birr value of customs collections even in the midst of slightly negative 
growth in USD imports. Comprehensive budget data including expenditure 
and deficit outturns is only available to December 2019, and this showed a 
six-month deficit of Birr 28bn (0.8 percent of GDP), or well within the 
budgeted figure of Birr 97bn (near 3 percent of GDP).
Debt: For the second quarter in a row, total public debt showed declines in 
level terms and not just as a share of GDP. Public debt reached $53.4bn at 
end-December 2019, down from its peak of $53.7bn as of June 2019. Relative 
to this year’s anticipated GDP (Birr 3,418bn or USD 108.3bn), public debt now 
stands at 49.2 percent, a near 10 percentage points drop from June 2018 
when the ratio peaked at 58.7 percent of GDP. Looking only at external debt, 
this now stands at 25.5 percent of GDP, also a major drop from its peak of 31 
percent seen in June 2018. The latest MOFEC debt data (per the Public Sector 
Debt Portfolio Report) showed external debt as of end-2019 continuing to 
have broadly favourable terms, i.e., low average interest rates of below 3 
percent and long average maturities of around 11 years. 
Trade: Export growth slowed to 10 percent as of March 2020 versus the 15 
percent year-on-year growth rates seen at the start the fiscal year. The five 
top performers—by dollar receipts—continued to be coffee ($563mn in nine 
months and up 13 percent), flowers ($339mn, up 100 percent), chat 
($256mn, up 10 percent), textiles ($142mn, up 30 percent) and fruits and 
vegetables ($69mn, up 56 percent). Two traditionally large export items, 
oilseeds ($236mn) and pulses ($164mn), are still showing declines from year-
ago levels and thus holding back Ethiopia’s export growth. With respect to 
import trends, the headline figures for the first nine months show a 4 percent 
decline, from $11.7bn to $11.2bn. However, excluding fuel imports (down 10 
percent due to global oil prices) and one-off aircraft purchases (which inflated 
last year’s figures), imports were up 6 percent as of March 2020, suggesting 
relatively moderate levels of economic activity. Areas with strong import 
trends included fertilizers (up 32 percent), agricultural capital equipment (up 
50 percent) and raw materials, while measures of discretionary consumer 
goods (non-durables excluding cereals) shrank by 20 percent as would be 
expected with the faster rate of exchange rate depreciation put in place since 
end 2019. 
Balance of payments (BOP): Data for the first six months of the fiscal year 
(latest available figures) showed a trade deficit of around $6bn, which was 
offset by $3.5bn in private and official transfers, resulting in a current account 
deficit of around $2.6 billion.  In the capital account, total fx inflows were near 
$2.2bn reflecting around $1bn in net government borrowing and just $1.3bn 
in FDI inflows.  Reflecting the net impacts of the above as well as other smaller 
items, and despite the first disbursement of the IMF loan taking place in 
December 2019, foreign exchange reserves fell by around $450mn over the

first half of the fiscal year, with fx reserves reaching $2,965mn at end-2019  
versus $3,415mn at end-June 2019. Though full BOP data are not available to 
end-March 2020, the fx reserves figure seen in monetary data reveal a level 
of $2.5bn as of end-March 2020, equivalent to around 2 months imports. 
Exchange rate: The exchange rate reached 32.81 Birr/USD at end-March 
2020, and fell further to 33.53 at end-April 2020, equivalent to a depreciation 
of 15 to 17 percent from year-ago levels.  The pace of depreciation has been 
stepped up from a monthly rate of 21 to 26 cents seen in January and 
February to monthly rates of 54 cents and 72 cents in March and April 
respectively. The accelerated rate of annual depreciation observed in recent 
months is now almost sufficient to cover domestic inflation, which should 
thus—going forward—help prevent an increase in the real effective exchange 
rate and what would be a consequent loss of external competitiveness. 
Sovereign bond and Market Ratings:  Ethiopia’s sole international sovereign 
bond showed the largest change in prices and yields since its issuance back in 
2014. Between mid-January and mid-March, as the global consequences of 
the corona pandemic became apparent (and largely before the first reported 
case in Ethiopia on March 13, 2020), the bond’s price had already fallen from 
109.7 to 89.7 (an 18 percent drop), while its yield—indicative of the interest 
rate needed to attract lenders—jumped by 500 basis points from a record 
low of just 4.4 percent in mid-January to 9.4 percent by end-March. The yield 
has moved to an even higher 10.1 percent as of early May, which broadly 
parallels the rising yields seen for many frontier and emerging markets over 
the past few months.2 With respect to the rating agencies (which have 
downgraded over 18 emerging markets in recent months per data from The 
Economist), Moody’s recently indicated that it will initiate a review of 
Ethiopia’s B1 rating following a downgrading to a ‘negative’ outlook late last 
year, while Standard and Poor’s and Fitch Ratings have maintained their ‘B’ 
credit ratings. 
2 Per Tellimer research data (Macro Analysis Note April 28, 2020), following expectations of debt 
relief for many low-income African countries, yields on their USD sovereign bonds are now close 
to or above 10 percent in many cases, including for  Ghana (12.1%), Nigeria (11.9%), Mozambique 
(11.6%), Rwanda (9.9%), Kenya (9.1%), Egypt (8.3%) and Cote d’Ivoire (8.0%).

Macroeconomic Outlook:
Main Points

Baseline Assumptions: Our underlying expectation for the year ahead 
remains that a ‘limited virus spread scenario’ can be maintained due to the 
substantial scale and scope of public health measures implemented in recent 
months. Accordingly, we expect the most severe economic impacts of the 
Corona virus will largely be confined to four sub-sectors whose combined 
weight in the overall economy is below 20 percent of GDP. 

Policy support: Policy interventions are beginning to provide assistance to  
affected sectors and the broader economy through direct funding, debt 
rescheduling, tax relief, and liquidity support. The size of stimulus measures 
on the fiscal side is close to 3 percent of GDP (including foregone/lower taxes 
and extra expenditure) and also substantial on the monetary side (with a 
planned doubling of growth rates in money supply, 1.2 percent of GDP in 
liquidity support, and a generous relaxation of bank rescheduling rules). In 
addition, a combination of reduced imports, increased foreign assistance 
($500mn already received, a similar amount likely forthcoming), and 
anticipated debt relief (possibly up to $1bn) is mitigating impacts from a 
balance of payments perspective.

Outlook: As the policy response to the economic shocks brought about by 
the Corona virus has been substantive, well-managed, and supported by 
foreign assistance, we think growth next year can reach 5 percent, though 
this will partly come at the expense of a much larger budget deficit, possibly 
higher inflation, lower private credit growth, and somewhat higher debt. 
Overview 
GDP growth: The severity of the corona pandemic on Ethiopia’s growth 
prospects will depend mainly on developments in three large sub-sectors that 
collectively account for 70 percent of GDP—namely agriculture, construction, 
and wholesale/retail trade. In our view, all three of these sectors are likely to 
face only modest or moderate impacts:
o For agriculture (36% of GDP), prospects in this sector are primarily  
influenced by rainfall conditions plus the availability of key inputs for 
farmers. In this respect, the outlook for the 2020 crop season shows 
favourable trends judging from the recent belg rains, the substantial 
growth in fertilizer imports (up 32 percent from year-ago and with a 
record 1.7mn tons to be distributed to farmers, per Ministry of 
Agriculture data) as well as the extensive government preparations 
taking place in the pre-harvest months (including recent campaigns in 
many regions to prepare as much lands as possible for the coming

planting season). Regarding concerns over recent locust infestations, this 
appears substantial at first glance (with around 200,000 hectares 
affected and 3.6 mn quintals lost according to government and donor 
assessments),3 but is actually comparatively modest when seen relative 
to Ethiopia’s total farmland (12.8mn hectares), total crop output (323mn 
quintals) or overall GDP (the net impact is on the order of 0.36 percent 
of total economic activity). Accordingly, with a (presumed) favourable 
rainy season, good supplies of fertilizer in place, and extensive regional 
plans to boost acreage under cultivation, growth of 3 to 4 percent is 
plausible—in our view—for the upcoming 2020-21 crop season.4
o With respect to construction activity (20% GDP), as this sector has not 
been interrupted by lockdowns and appears to be continuing its activities 
in most urban areas, growth declines should be modest and temporary, 
especially when also considering that public sector projects—which are 
to be maintained—continue to drive a large part of the activity in this 
area. 
o For wholesale and retail trade (14% of GDP) this sector might suffer a 
modest drop in activity, but again most of the activity in this area should 
not be interrupted for too long as it reflects trading in many non-
discretionary items such as basic food crops and consumer goods, 
exports and imports, and routine retail activities. 
o In contrast to the dominant parts of the economy noted above, the 
sectors most heavily affected by the corona virus are generally smaller 
segments of the wider economy, whether for hotels and restaurants 
(2.6% of GDP), exports (2.8% of GDP), manufacturing (4.1% of GDP), or 
banking (3.3% of GDP). Moreover, developments in April and early May 
2020 suggest that anticipated economic damages may turn out less than 
initially feared thanks in large part to series of measured but still 
significant policy and regulatory interventions: (1) the hospitality sector 
is now being compensated by a combination of debt rescheduling, tax 
relief, employee tax support, and a Birr 3.3bn lending program through 
commercial banks; (2) exporters are being provided generous debt 
service relief by banks, flower exports are down sharply but have not 
totally collapsed either (industry growers suggest 30-40 percent of prior 
export levels are taking place), and coffee exports are continuing to do 
well even in the most recent months (reaching $104mn in April 2020 
alone, or the highest monthly level in over a year); (3) manufacturers are 
receiving bank support and seeing a quicker-than-expected resumption 
of supply chains in China; and (4) banks are benefitting from a 
combination of liquidity relief and (thanks to recent NBE Circulars)

generous regulatory forbearance enabling them to much more flexibly 
reschedule loans and modify the short-term/long-term maturity mix of 
their loans without regulatory constraints or penalties.
 
o Overall GDP growth: Considering all of the above, and recalling the late 
onset of the Corona virus within Ethiopia’s current fiscal year (the four 
most affected sub-sectors were impacted for only the last four months 
of the year), we expect GDP growth will be around 6 percent for FY 
2019/20 versus our pre-corona projections of 8 percent.5  For the coming 
fiscal year, we maintain our previous growth projection of 5 percent (a 
2.5 percentage points decline from pre-corona projections), on the 
expectations that the full-year effects of the corona virus will result in 
notably slower growth for industry (9% vs 11%) and particularly services 
(3.5% vs 6.5%).6 In general, given the timing of Ethiopia’s July-to-June 
fiscal year, we are more optimistic about growth outturns for this fiscal 
year (being closer to the Government’s 6.2 projection for FY 2019-20 
rather than the World Bank’s 4.0 percent or the IMF’s 3.2 percent), while 
we expect slightly lower growth outturns for next fiscal year (closer to 
the IMF’s 4.3 percent projection for FY 2020-21 rather than the World 
Bank’s 6.0 percent or the Government’s 8.5 percent).  
Inflation: With respect to the inflation outlook, there is—as always—
considerable uncertainty over its upcoming movements and even direction. 
Several recent developments should certainly help reduce price pressures, 
including lower global oil prices and the deflationary impact of slowing 
activity in several service sectors.  At the same time, inflation could remain 
elevated or rise even further if the upcoming crop season produces weak 
results, if transport interruptions hinder movements in foodstuffs, and if the 
large size of fiscal and monetary stimulus measures (see below) aggravate 
excess demand pressures. On balance, we think a range of pre-emptive 
measures being taken by government can help minimize such risks: large 
government procurements of staple foods have recently been initiated to 
boost stocks of key items (1.8 mn tons of wheat, 320,000 tons of rice, 170,000 
tons of sugar, and 104mn litres of cooking oil); current transport restrictions 
across regions are clearly exempting cargo and foodstuff movements; and 
fiscal/monetary stimulus measures are being put in place only temporarily 
and expected to be unwound in 2021 (see below). Accordingly, we think it is 
more likely than not that inflation can trend gradually lower to 18 percent by 
5 Relative to our Corona Impacts research note of March 31, 2020, we reduce somewhat our 
services sector projection for the last quarter of this year and thus expect sector growth rates of 
4.3/11.0/4.0 for agriculture/industry/services, which gives overall growth of 6.0 percent given 
their respective weights of 33.3/27.1/39.6 percent in real GDP. 
6 More precisely, our projections reflect an assumption that sectors accounting for about 20 
percent of GDP experience a 5 percent drop in real activity over the course of the fiscal year, while 
the remaining non-affected parts of the economy collectively growth at close to 7 percent.

the end of this fiscal year (June 2020), and then fall further to the low teens 
by end 2020.
Fiscal policy and debt: Fiscal policy is set to be the most expansionary seen 
in many years, per the Government-IMF macro program, with the deficit 
deteriorating by a combined Birr 104bn (2.6 percent of GDP) this year and 
next (we had estimated a fiscal deterioration of near Birr 90bn or 2.3 percent 
of GDP).  Considering pre-existing deficit levels (pre-corona), the overall 
deficit this year will be a record high of Birr 134bn (near 4 percent of GDP) 
while another Birr 145bn (3.5 percent of GDP) deficit is planned next fiscal 
year—for a cumulative deficit of 7.5 percent of GDP over the two years.7 This 
exceptionally high budget deficit reflects large increases in COVID-related 
expenditure (Birr 69bn net) as well as a big drop in government revenue (Birr 
35bn net of extra grants).  The financing needed to cover the Birr 134bn 
deficit is, per the IMF Staff Report, to be secured by a combination of foreign 
loans (Birr 62bn or nearly $2bn) as well as domestic borrowing (Birr 71bn 
from NBE, banks, and non-banks). As of May 2020, Birr 32bn ($1bn) out of 
the Birr 134bn needed financing was still to be identified/secured, though a 
sizeable portion of this unidentified financing could potentially be covered by 
debt service relief from multilateral and bilateral creditors, to whom the 
Government owes around Birr 15bn (~$400mn) in annual debt service dues.8 
As should be expected, debt ratios will deteriorate in the coming year, 
reaching 55 percent of GDP vs the 52 percent anticipated pre-corona.
Monetary developments and banking: Alongside the large fiscal stimulus, a 
highly expansionary monetary policy is also being put in place to provide the 
needed support to the economy. While reserve money was (pre-corona) set 
to increase by only 12.5 percent this year, it is now expected to grow by 
double that amount, or 25 percent, per data in the latest IMF Staff Report. 
Similarly, though broad money growth was held to just 18 percent in the 
original Government-IMF macro program, a much higher broad money 
growth of 27 percent is now planned for the year, which will take overall 
money supply from Birr 886 billion as of last June to 1.12 trillion by June 2020 
(30 percent of GDP). The expanded broad money growth is intended to 
enable increased monetary financing of the deficit: government borrowing 
from the domestic financial system is going to be on the order of Birr 42bn 
this year, reflecting Birr 30bn in net borrowing from the central bank and 
another Birr 12bn in borrowing from banks and non-banks. One consequence 
of such expanded government borrowing will be less growth in credit to the 
private sector, which is likely to moderate next year given policy priorities 
7 The fiscal and monetary framework referred to here and expected to guide policy-making for 
the period ahead is based on the Government-IMF macro program as laid out in the May 2020 
IMF Staff Report; see Tables 2a/3 on the fiscal/monetary accounts respectively. 
8 Government debt service was $385mn in FY 2018-19 per MOFED Public Debt data. Most of 
Ethiopia’s nearly $2bn in annual external debt service is owed by state-owned enterprises not 
Government (see Footnote 9 for details on external debt service figures).

(only 6 percent growth is anticipated in the Government-IMF macro program 
for FY 2020-21, though this seems unrealistically low in our view). The high 
level of monetary growth and government financing for this year should be 
short-lived, however, as the macro program shows broad/base money 
growth reverting to more normal growth rates of just 12/10 percent for FY 
2020-21, with net government borrowing from the banking system also 
falling (towards Birr 30bn) by next year. On the regulatory front, besides 
providing flexibility to banks to reschedule loans without penalties, the 
central bank has provided a combined Birr 48bn in liquidity and related 
support to private and public banks as of mid-May (equivalent to 5 percent 
of deposits, or 1.2 percent of GDP, and close to our expectations at end-
March that as much as Birr 46bn in liquidity support may be required).
Balance of payments: With respect to the balance of payments, we broadly 
retain the outlook presented in our Corona impacts note of end-March 2020. 
In particular, we expect the balance of payments to show a near $1.5bn 
deterioration this fiscal year (vs pre-corona expectations), reflecting mainly 
lower service exports, reduced remittances, and delays in privatization-
related FDI inflows that were expected by June 2020. More specifically, for 
the soon-to-be-ending fiscal year, we see goods exports at $2.6bn (3 percent 
decline from last year), services exports at 4.6bn (a 5 percent drop), and 
remittances at $5.1bn (a 10 percent drop). On the capital account, we expect 
FDI will only reach $2.4bn for the year given delayed privatization. Reflecting 
these developments, we expect the fx reserves stock at the end of the fiscal 
year will only be around $2.6bn, rather than the $4bn expected pre-corona 
(which had assumed privatization inflows by June 2020). For next fiscal year, 
while a deterioration in some of the main current account items is likely (as 
service exports and remittances take time to recover) this should be more 
than offset by increased external grants and by a large capital account surplus 
linked to (presumed) privatization-related FDI inflows and significant foreign 
borrowing. Accordingly, we project a small balance of payments surplus and 
a rise in the reserves stock—boosted in part by IMF financing—to $3.7bn by 
June 2021. These projections do not incorporate potential debt relief from 
foreign creditors which, if it fully materializes from multilateral/bilateral 
creditors, would imply close to $1bn of reduced fx outflows and thus—all else 
equal—a correspondingly higher foreign reserves figure at year-end ($4.7bn 
rather than $3.7bn by June 2021).9   
9 Of the near $2bn in annual external debt service dues, and using FY 2018-19 data in MOFEC’s 
Public Debt Bulletin, $385m is owed by Government and $1,615mn is owed by SOEs. Roughly 
$620mn reflects interest repayments and $1,375mn are principal payments. By creditor, $207mn 
of the debt repayments were to multilaterals, $733mn to bilaterals, and $1,054mn to private 
creditors. Considering debt service relief only from multilateral and bilateral creditors, roughly 
$940mn (207+733) is very likely to be rescheduled under recent IMF/WB and G-20 initiatives. 
Some portion of the $1,054mn remaining dues owed to private creditors may be rescheduled, but 
this is unlikely for interest due on the sovereign bond ($66mn given the 6.65% coupon on the 
bond) as well as Ethiopian Airlines repayments due to private commercial bank lenders. Figures 
for this year and FY 2020-21 would be somewhat (but not much) higher than these numbers.

Exchange rate: As noted earlier, the pace of exchange rate depreciation has 
been stepped up since November 2019, and has recently been moving at a 
rate of 15 to 17 percent from year-ago levels.  The trends observed in the first 
half of May suggest that the depreciation will continue at a pace that stays 
within the 15-17 percent annualized rate. We assume this accelerated rate of 
annual depreciation is being pursued by the central bank to prevent a rise in 
the real effective exchange rate and so expect this to continue in the current 
environment of elevated inflation. Accordingly, we anticipate gradual 
depreciations of 50 to 60 cents per month continuing for the remainder of 
the calendar year, and thus see the rate at just under 35 Birr/USD by end-
June 2020 and just under 38 Birr/USD by end-2020. 
A summary of our full set of macroeconomic projections—covering the real, 
banking, fiscal, and external sectors—is provided in the attached Annex.

Median, excluding Ethiopia:
Ethiopia if case/death rates per million
were at Top 20 median:

Ethiopia still has the lowest reported case among the world’s 20 most populous countries

Reported deaths are also among the lowest, second only to Vietnam which reports zero deaths.

Ethiopia’s low case numbers may reflect limited testing (around 50,000 so far), but the low death 
count still suggests a relatively contained and/or non-fatal virus spread.

ECONOMIC ACTIVITY: Recent Developments and Outlook
Growth outlook:

We expect only a 2 percentage points 
drop in growth this year, largely since 
two-thirds of the fiscal year was 
unaffected by corona impacts and the 
most heavily affected sub-sectors make 
up a comparatively limited segment of 
the economy.

For next fiscal year, we see a somewhat 
larger drop and forecast 5 percent 
growth, reflecting mainly service sector 
impacts. This would mark Ethiopia’s 
slowest growth in 18 years.

The Government, IMF, and World Bank 
all expect positive—but reduced—
growth both this year and next.

We are closer to the Government’s 
growth projection for this year, but less 
optimistic than others for next fiscal 
year.

Activity indicators as of March 2020 
(thus pre-corona) showed positive 
trends in many areas—such as in fuel 
consumption, tax collections, bank 
lending, industrial park exports as well 
as employment, and ECX commodity 
trades of major agricultural products. 

The weak areas observed were in FDI 
inflows, electricity power generation, 
and tourist arrivals.

Recent Developments… continued:

Locust infestations in Ethiopia and 
the region have continued to be of 
concern for their potential impact 
on food crops. 

However, most food-growing areas 
within 
Ethiopia 
are 
still 
not 
substantially affected.

Estimates of affected farmland and 
crop losses have increased since 
February, with the size of locust-
infested areas now estimated at 
nearly 200,000 hectares versus just 
70,000 before.

However, even with this increase, 
the overall impact remains limited 
to date: 1.5 percent of hectares 
farmed and 1.1 percent of annual 
crop output.

Recent rainfall data suggest most 
areas of the country are having 
average to above-average rains. 

The 
Meteorological 
Agency’s 
forecast for the kiremt months is 
not yet available and is expected to 
be released in June 2020. But if the 
pattern of recent belg rains 
continues into the kiremt months, 
this should bode well for the 
upcoming crop season.

PRICES AND INFLATION: Recent Developments and Outlook
Inflation outturns:

Inflation has been above 20 
percent for six months now and 
stood at 22.9 percent as of April 
2020. 

Inflation has increasingly spread 
to non-food items as well as to 
services 
(though 
it 
was 
previously very high mainly for 
food items) 

Items whose inflation rate has 
risen 
markedly 
in 
recent 
months 
are 
alcoholic 
beverages, 
housing/utilities,

Recent Developments… continued:

Cereals (grains) remain the 
largest contributor to inflation, 
which also reflects their high 17 
percent weight in the inflation  
index

Housing/utilities and vegetable 
prices were also among the 
highest sources of inflation. 

Within cereals, price increases 
for teff have been particularly 
high (up around 50 percent to 
Birr 3,700 per quintal from Birr 
2,400 a year ago)

Prices of other major grains—
wheat, maize, and sorghum—
remain roughly flat vs year-ago 
levels

Three 
line-items 
with 
a 
combined weight of 50 percent 
are primarily responsible for 
Ethiopia’s double-digit inflation. 
 

Excluding these three items, 
inflation would be 9.9 percent.

Month on month inflation:

Month-on-month 
inflation 
remains unusually high, in 
the range of 2% to 3% 
recently, and thus over 24% 
and 36% on an annualized 
basis.

Month-on-month 
inflation 
has exceeded its normal 
patterns at this time of year 
(based on the ten-year 
average) 
for 
three 
consecutive months.

Looking 
ahead, 
planned 
government procurements 
of 
staple 
foods 
could 
moderate inflation in the 
coming months. 

The planned procurement 
volumes are significant; by 
our calculations, they are 
roughly 36 percent of last 
year’s domestic wheat crop, 
65 percent of the domestic 
sugar harvest, and nearly 
equal to Ethiopia’s (small) 
annual rice crop. 

Supported by moderating 
food prices, we expect 1 
percent 
month-on-month 
inflation 
rates 
for 
the 
coming months, until this 
switches to negative rates 
(per 
seasonal 
patterns)  
following crop harvests. 

On this basis, we project 
inflation of 18 percent by 
June 2020 and 12 percent by 
December 2020.

MONETARY POLICY: Recent developments and outlook
Monetary growth:

Growth in money supply has 
slowed to 19 percent (year-on-
year) as of end-March, and to 
an even lower rate of 11 
percent on a nine-month basis. 

A more restrained monetary 
policy 
stance 
(to 
control 
inflation) was clearly beginning 
to be put in place as of March 
2020, prior to the onset of the 
corona pandemic.

Domestic financing

Total financing supplied within 
the economy grew to Birr 1.4 
trillion, up around 22 percent 
from a year-ago.

The public sector’s use of total 
domestic financing (reflecting 
past financing patterns) remains 
dominant but has been declining, 
from 68 percent two years ago to 
63 percent as of Dec 2019. 

By instrument, the share of bond 
financing stands at 36 percent, 
reflecting large SOE borrowings 
via bond issues to the CBE 
Bank loans by sectors:

The four sectors with the fastest 
credit growth were domestic 
trade, 
housing/construction, 
exports, and personal loans.

Industry remains the largest 
recipient of loans, reflecting SOE 
allocations at CBE.

Outstanding bond issuances:

SOE 
bond 
borrowing 
has 
essentially come to a stop in the 
last six months, with their 
outstanding bond issues up only 
slightly from Birr 339bn at end 
June 2019 to Birr 341bn at end 
December 2019. 

Regional governments are seen 
to be repaying their bond debt 
on a net basis. 
BANKING: Recent developments and outlook

Overall deposit growth has moderated to just 18 percent (year-on-year), and particularly 
so at CBE (16 percent year-on-year)

Loan growth of 32 percent suggests expanding activity levels in the economy, and especially 
in the private sector (to whom most private bank lending is provided).

Monetary developments and outlook… continued:

Looking ahead, the Govt-IMF 
macro program shows a planned 
loosening of monetary policy, 
with reserve money growth set to 
double (25% vs 12.5%) and broad 
money growth rising by one-and-
a-half times previous plans (27% 
vs 18%).  

To help finance the much larger 
deficit (see below), an increased 
allowance is being made for net 
credit to government: Birr 41bn 
vs a previously planned Birr 7.6bn

Liquidity support to private and 
public banks explains part of the 
planned increase in monetary 
growth. Approximately Birr 48bn 
in such liquidity and related 
support is being provided based 
on NBE announcements.

FISCAL POLICY: Recent developments 
Revenue performance

Tax collections continued to 
post positive results (Birr 183bn 
in nine months), with the latest 
reading at end-March up 26 
percent from last year.

Trade taxes, which are boosted 
by the faster depreciation, did 
particularly well with growth of 
46 
percent 
from 
year-ago 
levels—despite 
lower 
USD 
import levels.
Budget performance: 

Full budget data (including 
expenditure outturns) are only 
available up to Dec 2019 and 
show spending growth below 
revenue growth, while the 
deficit appears to be in line with 
the year-total levels (Birr 85bn 
for the year).
Public debt, in USD terms:

For the second quarter in a row, 
total public debt is declining in 
level terms, and not just as a 
share of GDP. 

Public debt remains roughly 
evenly split between external and 
domestic debt.

Public debt, relative to GDP:

Relative to this year’s anticipated 
GDP, public debt is now nearly 10 
percentage points lower than it 
was 18 months ago.  
External debt stocks:

Total external debt has moved 
slightly upwards in USD terms 
due to new loans contracted in 
the past year, but is down relative 
to GDP when compared to the 
start of the year. 

Of the nearly $2bn in external 
debt service dues last year, most 
of it ($1.6bn or ~70%) was owed 
by state-owned enterprises. 

By creditor, private lenders are 
owed the highest share of debt 
service, followed by bilateral 
creditors. 
If 
recent 
corona-
related debt relief schemes cover 
just multilateral and bilateral 
creditors, then only about half of 
Ethiopia’s 
debt 
service 
obligations would be postponed 
through such debt relief.

FISCAL OUTLOOK: Post-Covid Developments

 The 
Government’s 
Corona 
Response Plan covers three 
distinct 
areas—emergency 
spending 
for 
health, 
food, 
nutrition, and shelter; support to 
the 
private 
sector; 
and 
accommodating 
foregone/lost 
revenues 
due 
to 
reduced 
business activity. 

The emergency spending needs 
are 
areas 
where 
Ethiopia 
normally 
receives/allocates 
funding even in past years. 

 The budget deficit was expected 
to be Birr 85bn pre-corona, but is 
now projected to reach Birr 
134bn (2.6% of GDP) due to extra 
corona related spending and 
foregone/lower revenue. 

Seen over a two-year time frame, 
the cumulative budget deficit will 
be a high 7 percent of GDP.

Fiscal outlook… continued:

Financing of the large deficits 
is relying somewhat more on 
domestic borrowing though 
external loans of $2bn this 
year are also anticipated. 

As of May 2020, and based on 
the IMF staff report, around 
Birr 32bn of the needed 
financing is still to be secured; 
part of this may be covered by 
forthcoming 
debt 
service 
relief 
expected 
from 
multilateral 
and 
bilateral 
creditors. 

Figures reported by both the 
Government and IMF are 
nearly identical, though there 
are 
some 
compositional 
differences; our estimates of 
net required fiscal resources 
in our March 2020 research 
note were somewhat below 
these figures (2.3 percent vs 
2.7 percent of GDP).

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS (BOP): Recent developments 

Full balance of payments data 
are only available to Dec 2019, 
though some components 
(exports, imports, reserves) 
are available and reported 
here for end-March 2020. 

The outturns for the first half 
of the fiscal year point to a 
notable improvement (from 
year-ago levels) in the trade 
deficit, 
but 
a 
drop-in 
remittances, official grants, 
and FDI.  

Some of these six-month data, 
such as for grants, may reflect 
lumpy inflows and may thus 
reverse 
in 
subsequent 
quarters.
FX reserves:

Foreign exchange reserves 
were around $2.5bn at end-
March 2020, down from 
nearly $3bn the previous 
quarter.

Large external debt service 
repayments appear to explain 
this drop, which has occurred 
despite the receipt of the IMF 
program’s 
first 
loan 
disbursement of $315mn.

TRADE PERFORMANCE: Recent developments
Export performance:

Exports are continuing to 
perform moderately well (10 
percent growth), though this 
is somewhat below the 15 
percent growth seen earlier in 
the fiscal year.

The top performers by dollar 
receipts continue to be coffee, 
flowers, and chat—each of 
which generated more than a 
quarter billion dollars in just 
nine months. 

Among large-value exports, 
those with the best growth 
record this past quarter were 
flowers, fruits and vegetables, 
textiles, coffee, and chat.

The declines seen in two large 
export items—oilseeds and 
pulses—continues 
to 
hold 
back Ethiopia’s export growth. 
A strong increase in these two 
categories could push export 
growth to the high teens or 
above 20 percent.

Trade performance… continued:

Coffee exports have continued 
to do well even since the onset 
of the corona pandemic.

Exports in April 2020 reached 
$104mn for the month, the 
highest level seen in a year and 
up 39 percent from year-ago 
levels. 
For 
Jan-April 
2020, 
coffee exports were up by 26 
percent versus the same four-
month period last year.

Industrial park exports have 
declined slightly over the past 
two 
consecutive 
quarters, 
though they are up 30 percent 
from year-ago levels ($43mn in 
the latest quarter vs $33mn a 
year ago).

Trade performance… continued:

Overall import growth continues 
to be negative, though slightly 
less so than earlier in the fiscal 
year (now -4% vs -7% before). 
This would normally suggest 
weak or declining levels of 
economic activity. 

However, excluding fuel imports 
and one-off aircraft purchases, 
import growth shows a more 
solid rate of 6 percent.

Consumer goods imports are flat 
in USD terms (and thus shrinking 
relative 
to 
GDP). 
“Other 
consumer goods” which were a 
large share of imports at $627mn 
last year and represent many 
discretionary items have fallen by 
20 percent—likely reflecting their  
greater sensitivity to a more 
depreciated exchange rate.

Capital 
goods 
imports 
for 
industrial and agricultural goods 
continue 
to 
show 
positive 
growth, 
especially 
so 
for 
agricultural machinery.

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS OUTLOOK: Post-Covid Developments 

The IMF projects a balance of 
payments 
deterioration 
of 
over 
$1.9bn this year and $0.3bn next year, 
for a cumulative impact of $2.2bn over 
the two years (versus pre-corona 
projections). 

Most of this deterioration is due to a 
drop in service exports, remittances, 
and FDI—which are only partly offset 
by much reduced imports.

The balance of payments outlook 
involves considerable uncertainty as a 
lot depends on judgements regarding 
the speed and scale of the global 
recovery in areas such as trade, travel, 
and remittances.  

For perspective on some of the 
differing judgements possible on key 
BOP 
flows, 
we 
compare 
our 
projections to those in the latest IMF 
staff 
report. 
We 
note 
similar 
expectations on the current account 
(but with compositional differences), 
though show marked differences on 
the capital account, where we see 
more scope for net new borrowing to 
be more in line with recent norms.

The overall BOP deficits anticipated 
this year and next will be financed in 
part by exceptional financing from the 
IMF (not shown in the capital account, 
per conventions) as well as expected 
debt relief. Accordingly, fx reserve 
levels will not decline as implied by the 
BOP deficit figures shown here (since 
financing items are not included and 
debt relief also not shown).

ETHIOPIA’S SOVEREIGN BOND: Recent developments and outlook
Sovereign Bond Yields:

Ethiopia’s sovereign bond is now 
showing its highest yield since it was 
issued back in December 2014.

Ethiopia is not alone in seeing such a 
rapid and significant jump in yields, 
however, with most frontier and 
emerging 
markets 
witnessing 
increases of 4 to 8 percentage points 
over the past few months. 
Sovereign Bond Prices:

Prices for the bonds are at record 
lows, and bondholders (who are 
mostly US-based asset managers) 
would thus have seen a drop in their 
holdings of near 18 percent over the 
past quarter. 

The price drop reflects expectations 
that many developing countries will 
seek 
debt 
rescheduling 
and/or 
reduction over the coming months, 
and that this will potentially apply to 
private as well as official creditors.
Spread vs US Treasuries:

Spreads vs US Treasures have jumped 
in line with rising yields; the effective 
borrowing rate on the Ethiopian bond 
is thus now 10 percentage points 
higher 
than 
the 
US 
Treasury 
equivalent. 

The larger gap reflects not just the rise 
in Ethiopia’s sovereign bond yield but 
also the drop in US 10-year Treasury 
yields—which are now just 0.65% 
versus 2.3% this time last year.

EXCHANGE RATE: Recent developments and outlook
Exchange rate trends:

The Birr exchange rate of 33.53 
per USD at end-April 2020 is 
now 17 percent below its year-
ago level. 

While annual depreciation rates 
were near 6 percent in early 
2019 
and 
before, 
the 
annualized 
exchange 
rate 
depreciation has moved to a 
rate of 13-17 percent since 
December 2019.

The gap between the official 
and parallel rates has continued 
to narrow, though it still 
remains sizeable.

Exchange rate developments… continued:

After moderating in January 
and February (21 to 26 cents 
of monthly depreciation), 
the pace of Birr depreciation 
has picked up pace in the last 
two months and has been 
between 54 and 72 cents per 
month.

Looking ahead, we assume 
and expect the accelerated 
rate of monthly depreciation 
is being pursued by the 
central bank to prevent a 
rise in the real effective 
exchange rate (and loss of 
competitiveness) 
in 
the 
context of elevated inflation. 

Accordingly, we anticipate a 
50 to 60 cents pace of 
monthly depreciation to the 
end of the calendar year, 
and 
we 
thus 
see 
the 
exchange rate at just under 
35 Birr/USD by end June 
2020 and just under 38 
Birr/USD by end Dec 2020.
