This note summarizes the main contents of Ethiopia’s recently released 
government budget and highlights: (1) the policy priorities being articulated for 
the new fiscal year; (2) the composition of spending across key departments, 
and; (3) the implications of the budget deficit for government borrowing from 
the banking system. 
 
§ 
New Budget: The Ethiopian Parliament approved on July 8, 2019 a 
federal government budget with planned expenditure of Birr 387bn for 
the 2019-20 fiscal year (Table 1).  The spending planned for the new fiscal 
year (which started July 8) shows only a 2 percent increase in nominal 
terms (after including last year’s Supplementary Budget), and will 
amount to an 8 percent expenditure reduction in real terms (Table 2).  
 
§ 
Funding sources: Around 75 percent of government spending is to be 
covered by revenue and grants (Birr 253bn in revenue and Birr 36.8bn in 
grants). At the same time, nearly a quarter of total expenditure, equal to 
Birr 97.1 bn or 3 percent of GDP, will require deficit financing in the form 
of new loans from both foreign and domestic sources. Of the total net 
new borrowing planned for the year, around Birr 40bn (~$1.4bn) is to be 
covered by foreign loans, while the remaining Birr 57bn will require 
government borrowing from domestic sources (i.e., the central bank, 
commercial banks, and pension funds). 
 
§ 
Budget expenditure: Per the classifications of the federal budget 
document, Ethiopia’s total government spending of Birr 387bn  is split 
across four categories: (1) current spending; (2) capital spending; (3) 
subsidies to regions; and (4) support for the Sustainable Development 
Goasl or SDGs (Table 2). The first two items, collectively amounting to 
Birr 240bn, are items spent directly by the federal government and can 
be further broken down into the following main federally administered 
spending items (Table 3 and 4):  
 
§ 
Education holds the highest spending allocation in this year’s 
federal budget, at Birr 50.6bn, with funding in this line-item 
mainly allocated to about 50 federally-administered universities  
(for an average allocation of around one billion per university). 
§ 
Roads constitute the second largest federal spending item, with 
Birr 46.7bn allocation to start or complete several dozen road 
projects spread throughout the country.

§ 
Debt service: Allocations to cover external as well as internal 
debt are the budget’s third largest spending item at Birr 25.2bn, 
indicative of the cumulative impact of deficit-related borrowing 
over the past decade, particularly from external lenders (61 
percent of this line-item covers external debt repayments). 
§ 
Water & Energy is the fourth largest budget allocation, at Birr 
17.5bn, and covers funding for irrigation, water development, 
and energy projects. 
§ 
Administrative and ‘general service’ allocations, covering units 
such as the PM/President’s Offices, Courts, and key federal 
ministries, comprise the 5th largest expenditure allocation (or 
about 10 percent of federally administrative expenditure for 
what may be seen as ‘overhead’ functions/departments). 
§ 
Defence has been allocated Birr 15bn this fiscal year, 6th largest 
overall and held flat in nominal terms from last year’s levels.  
§ 
Two economic sectors—agriculture and industry—have the 7th 
and 10th largest budgetary allocations, with funds in this area 
mainly used for key agencies and institutes providing sector-
wide support within those productive sectors. 
§ 
Health related funding is Birr 12.8bn for this year, making this 
the 8th largest government budget allocation. 
§ 
Security: At Birr 8.1bn, security and justice related allocations 
make up the 9th largest government expenditure item, roughly in 
line with its relative ranking in recent years. 
 
Policy Priorities 
 
The most notable policy features of the new budget document include: 
 
• 
A responsible spending stance to address macro risks: The planned 
spending increase of the new budget is set to be the lowest seen in 
many years. This choice to hold back growth in government 
spending, at a time when there are numerous and competing 
expenditure demands across sectors, reveals a strong policy 
commitment to maintaining a responsible macroeconomic stance—
and is quite commendable in limiting spending to  available 
resources and in reducing the risks of future debt distress.    
• 
Still-high capital expenditure: At 54 percent of federal expenditure 
(Birr 131bn out of Birr 240bn), capital spending remains a high share 
of Ethiopia’s federal spending allocations, reflecting still-high outlays 
for public investment activity. The share of current spending in total 
spending is gradually rising, however, and is now 46 percent of 
federal spending, up from 42 percent two years ago and 45 percent 
last year. The new budget also reveals higher growth for current 
spending (19 percent) than for capital spending (16 percent).

• 
Still-strong focus on revenue mobilization: The need to support 
spending levels with expanding revenue is clearly recognized in the 
budget, with revenue set to rise from Birr 225bn to Birr 290bn, or by 
29 percent in nominal terms. Strong increases are planned in both 
tax (34% increase) and non-tax revenue (52% increase), particularly 
in VAT (+63%) as well as indirect taxes (+43%).  At the same time, 
specific tax rate changes (per recent press reports) are likely to 
involve higher excise taxes, higher taxes on specific commodities 
(e.g., automobiles), and a streamlining of tax incentives to limit 
foregone tax revenue going forward. 
 
Spending composition  
 
Spending priorities seen by detailed departmental line-item show a 
continuation of past norms in many areas, but also reflect emerging priorities 
in selected sub-sectors (Table 5):  
 
• 
Supporting traditional priorities: Still-high allocations for education, 
roads, and other capital projects show policy-makers’ continued 
commitment to the provision of (poverty-reducing) public goods and 
public infrastructure. These areas have not only maintained their 
high expenditure allocations, but many have also seen further 
planned increases of 15-20 percent for the coming year. In particular: 
o Education allocations were already among the highest 
within the federal budget, but are boosted even further this 
year from last year’s Birr 43bn to Birr 50 bn (up 13 percent); 
o Road allocations, a high priority item for many years, are 
raised by 21 percent to Birr 47bn from Birr 39bn last year. 
o Debt service allocations are raised from Birr 22 to 25 bn, up 
by 14 percent, likely reflecting the profile of repayments but 
also a commitment to fully cover outstanding dues. 
o Justice and security service allocations are raised from Birr 
6.8 to 8.1, or up by a sizeable 19 percent for the new year.  
 
• 
Addressing new priorities: Some of the most notable new policy 
priorities are seen in spending allocations for irrigation (Birr 15bn), 
planned national elections in 2020 (Birr 2bn), and contingencies for 
unexpected items (Birr 13bn, likely to include contingencies for 
wages and other recurrent items). At the same time, the 
discontinuation of certain line-items points to new policy priorities: 
within transfers to state enterprises/agencies, for example, the 
Industrial Parks Development Corporation (IPDC) was a large 
beneficiary in past years but no explicit transfer allocations have 
been made for it this year in line (it appears) with modified directions 
to use PPPs and private-led initiatives in this area (Table 5).

Deficit financing implications 
 
The planned deficit of near Birr 100bn, though a record high in nominal 
terms, amounts to 3 percent of the projected 2019-20 nominal GDP of Birr 
3.2 trillion. Per the budget document, about Birr 40 billion of the required 
deficit financing should be secured from foreign loans including the World 
Bank, the African Development Bank, and other bilateral/multilateral 
lenders—leaving Birr 57bn to be covered by financing from domestic 
sources.  
 
The Birr 57bn in required domestic financing should be seen in relation to 
the total available pool of domestic financing resources, as well as in the 
context of specific funding sources typically used to cover government 
deficits (Table 6):  
 
• 
Total domestic financing stood at around Birr 1,130bn as of 
December 2018—based on our compilation of the sum of all bank 
loans and bonds provided to government, SOEs, and the private 
sector.  In this context, the new financing need of Birr 57bn 
represents around 5 percent of the (pre-existing) stock of total 
domestic financing provided from all sources by Ethiopia’s financial 
system.  
 
• 
Bank deposits: Looking only at deposits, the commercial banking 
system held around Birr 837bn in deposits as of March 2019 and is 
likely to have ended the fiscal year with a deposit stock of near Birr 
891bn (22 percent growth from year-ago levels).  With similar 
growth for the new year, deposit levels should reach close to Birr 1.1 
trillion by end-June 2020, implying that the Birr 57bn in government 
borrowing would be equivalent to around 5 percent of outstanding 
bank deposits. Relative to the incremental deposit growth for the 
fiscal year of only around Birr 208bn, however, the government’s 
financing need absorbs the equivalent of 27 percent of new bank 
deposits—a significant, if not overwhelming, crowding out of funds 
that might have otherwise gone to private sector borrowers.  
 
• 
Central bank credit: Based on MOFED debt data, government 
borrowing from the central bank amounted to Birr 182 bn as of 
March 2019, comprised mostly of direct advances from the NBE to 
government (Table 7). Were the full Birr 57bn in new domestic 
financing secured solely from the central bank (a very inflationary 
form of deficit financing), this would imply a 31 percent growth in 
the rate of central bank lending to the government—a high rate of 
growth whether seen in nominal or real terms.

• 
T-Bills and Pension Funds: Government borrowing via T-Bills 
(purchased mainly by pension funds) amounted to Birr 132bn as of 
March 2019, and Birr 57bn in new borrowing would imply a 43 
percent increase from the latest outstanding stock. Judging from 
increases in pension fund holdings of T-Bills in recent years, annual 
net new purchases of T-Bills by pension funds were as high as Birr 
20bn last year, implying that only around one-third of the budget’s 
domestic borrowing requirement would be covered if relying solely 
on incremental pension fund assets.  
 
To summarize, for all three sources of domestic financing noted above—
commercial banks, NBE, and pension funds—accommodating the full 
amount of the Birr 57bn in required domestic financing would represent a 
material use of their respective funds.1 Indeed, a sole reliance on just one of 
the three financing sources could lead to excessive private sector crowding 
out (i.e., if relying on just bank deposits) or bring highly inflationary 
consequences (if resorting solely to central bank credit). However, a 
balanced mix of the three options could avoid such extreme outcomes and 
have only moderate inflationary and crowding out impacts. We expect this 
will be the case for the coming year, and anticipate that 10-15 percent 
growth in the stock of credit from banks, from NBE, and from pension funds 
(each separately) could collectively cover the total required domestic 
financing without unduly straining one particular source of financing.  
 
Conclusion 
 
Overall, the budget for the new fiscal year is—in our view—safe, sound and 
sensible, given its expenditure restraint to address prevailing macro concerns 
(inflation, exchange rate); its continued allocation for high-priority public 
investment outlays (roads, education, energy); its focus on new initiatives 
(irrigation) that promise to boost critical productive sectors; its due 
allowances for supporting the on-going political transition (elections, 
justice/security funding); and finally its responsible borrowing limits (held to 
just 3 percent of GDP and unlikely to worsen existing debt-to-GDP ratios).    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                        
1 For the current outstanding stock of domestic debt, it is worth noting that the Birr 344bn borrowed by the government 
has been sourced from the following domestic debt sources: 53 percent from the central bank, 39 percent from T-Bills 
(mainly held by pension funds); and 8 percent from commercial banks (Table 7).
