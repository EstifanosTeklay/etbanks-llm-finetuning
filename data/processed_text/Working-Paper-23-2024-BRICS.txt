EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
Regulation of international trade and cross-border exchange of goods, 
services, and capital requires an international economic order established with a set 
of prescribed rules, norms, ad procedures. The New International Economic Order 
(NIEO) is an economic movement after the second world war with the aim of 
reforming the governance of international financial institutions, redistributing wealth 
between developing and developed nations, ensuring economic sovereignty of 
developing nations, and enhancing south-south collaboration.  
However, the objectives of the NIEO are not fulfilled and have become one 
of the global debatable issues. The failure of the NIEO is believed to be the principal 
reason for the formation of new economic blocs that could realize the development 
objectives of nations. The BRICS4 is one of such economic blocs with new 
ambitions.  
The BRICS formed in 2010, invited six more countries to join the bloc. 
These are Ethiopia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, United Arab Emirates, and Argentina. 
Ethiopia is the focus of this study. Its primary purpose is to investigate the benefits 
Ethiopia is likely to get from joining the BRICS and the costs it is likely to incur. 
The BRICS formed in 2010, invited six more countries to join the bloc. 
These are Ethiopia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, United Arab Emirates, and Argentina. 
Ethiopia is the focus of this study. Its primary purpose is to investigate the benefits 
Ethiopia is likely to get from joining the BRICS and the costs it is likely to incur. 
Primary perception data were collected from expert survey of 233 
economists (EEA members) and used to investigate their views on Ethiopia’s 
decision to join the BRICS. The expert survey covers potential costs, benefits, and 
threats.  Since financial sectors are the principal actors in the global economy in 
general and the BRICS in particular, the perception survey also covered to what 
extent respondents trust these institutions in achieving their goals and their 
aspirations.  
 
The failure of the NIEO to realize its four global objectives has been 
evidenced. The two IFIs (WBG and IMF) were not reformed and developing nations 
were not able to get equitable access to development finance. Governance of these 
financial institutions is controlled by a few member states. The governance problem 
in both the WBG and the IMF is nearly similar. Top five and top 20 countries,

respectively, control 37 and 69.3 percent of the voting power (capital stock) in the 
WBG. On the other hand, other !62 member states have only 30 percent of the total 
voting power (average of 0.19 each). 
The two international financial institutions, namely WBG and IMF, were not 
reformed and developing nations were not able to get equitable voice and access to 
development finance. Governance of these financial institutions is controlled by a 
few member states. The top five and top 20 countries, respectively, control 37 and 
69.3 percent of the voting power (capital stock) in the WBG. The other 162 member 
states have only 30 percent of the total voting power (average of 0.19 each). 
The objective of the NIEO to redistribute wealth between developing and 
developed nations was not realized as verified by the following indicators.  
 
Income and output gaps between the two groups were rather increasing;  
 
Export gaps were increasing and LDCs could not benefit from 
international trade; 
 
The gap in external balance of goods and services was increasing; and 
 
There is no improvement or significant change in Foreign Direct 
Investment (FDI) inflows and outflows. 
 
The BRICS bank was established in 2014 and has set a 3-year deadline (by 2026) 
to de-dollarization, that is, to switch away from the USD. The majority of the survey 
participants support Ethiopia’s decision to join the BRICS and concur with de-
dollarization initiatives of the New Development Bank (NDB). However, they have 
a longer time horizon of 10+ years for the BRICS group to be able to abandon the 
USD and replace it with local currencies.  
It is perceived that economic benefits will outweigh other benefits of joining the 
BRICS. Likewise, political costs will outweigh other costs. Nearly half of the experts 
perceive that Ethiopia will incur economic costs as well. Vast majority say that 
Ethiopia will face several adverse measures from the western powers. These include 
refusal or reduction of new loans and grants, financial disbursement problems, and 
pressure for devaluation of local currency. Substantial political measures and 
pressure on FDI are also expected from the western powers. 
From financial institutions perspectives, the National Bank of Ethiopia’s 
(NBE) ability to achieve its predefined goals and objectives is perceived to be low. 
Consequently, the experts have very low institutional trust and confidence in the 
NBE to be an active player within the BRICS group and therefore needs to reform 
and strengthen its capacity to the level comparable to financial institutions in the 
 viii  
member states of the BRICS. The NBE is expected to undertake reform measures 
related to development of financial markets and the banking system in Ethiopia. 
The failure to realize the global objectives of the NIEO has driven 
developing nations and emerging economies to look for alternative economic blocs 
suitable for realizing their development objectives. Formation of the BRICS is the 
first of its kind initiated to play this role in the international economic system. 
However, the expansion of the BRICS membership is suffocated with and 
overwhelmed by diverse perceptions. There are several issues which require further 
investigation of the tangible benefits, costs, and requirements for Ethiopia to benefit 
from the BRICS.  
The following concluding remarks are drawn from the study. 
1. Flawed implementation of the NIEO calls for the need to identify and 
join relevant economic blocs and exploit development opportunities 
arising from such alternatives. If the WBG and the IMF are not 
committed to undertake significant reforms, nations with common 
agenda should cooperate and establish new economic blocs and enhance 
their development endeavors.  In this regard, the formation of BRICS is 
perceived to be right.   
2. Ethiopia should rigorously investigate the multidimensional effects and 
risks of joining the BRICS even after the January 2024 deadline. 
3. At least in shortrun, Ethiopia should work with both the BRICS and the 
western IFIs mainly because: 
 
Trading with local currencies with member states of the BRICS 
takes time for identification of and collaboration with new trading 
partners. 
 
The use of local currency for Ethiopia is less likely and aggravates 
the existing forex constraint. 
4. Due to its weak financial and banking system, Ethiopia should make 
substantial reform measures and create vibrant banking system and 
financial markets comparable to that of member states in the BRICS.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
After the end of colonialism in the 1960s, the world economy faced several 
challenges constraining sustainable and inclusive development. Though nations had 
realized their political independence, economic colonialism still remains to be the 
problem to the sovereignty of developing countries. They are not able to formulate 
and implement independent and relevant economic policies, benefit from 
international trade, get equitable access to development finance, and ensure 
technological advancement for inclusive and sustainable development. 
 
The New International Economic Order (NIEO) is an economic movement 
after the second world war with the general aim of empowering developing countries 
through economic growth. It was proposed with the primary objectives of bringing 
reform in the governance of the world economy and enabling the integration of the 
decolonized nations. The NIEO is a set of proposals advocated by developing 
countries to end economic colonialism and dependency through a new 
interdependent global economy (Laszlo et al. 1978). It was established to achieve 
objectives of  
a. reforming the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and ensure social 
justice among the trading countries of the world;  
b. redistribution of wealth between developed and developing nations; 
c. enhanced economic sovereignty; and  
d. Enhanced south-south collaboration.  
 
The NIEO criticized the then political and economic systems due to the fact 
that developed countries were benefiting at the cost of developing countries, 
suggesting the need for a new system that benefits the latter more than the former.  
However, literature indicates that the NIEO is hypothetical and unorganized 
movement where clear division and disagreements among its members is evident 
(Fesseha, 2017). Developing countries failed to form unity, to demonstrate their 
commitment to meeting the objectives of NIEO, and unable to compete in the world 
market. 
The NIEO is one of the debatable global issues arising from the controversy its 
success and failure. The need for revision of the NIEO or to develop another global order 
is widely suggested. Some of the reasons include the following (Chang, 2020; WEF, 
2023): 
 
The commitment by developed nations for the NIEO has gradually faded; 
2  
 
There is no longer systematic competition between the capitalist and the 
socialist blocs;  
 
There is a need for increasing interactions among developing economies 
themselves; 
 
There are difficulties of implementing some proposals in the NIEO and loss 
of confidence by LDCs in the global economic systems;  
 
The share of developed nations in the global economy is decreasing thereby 
affecting structure of the world economy; 
 
There are emerging factors in favor of developing countries (including the 
rise of China and climate change);  
 
Many economies are facing contractionary trends due to pandemics and 
other global shocks; and 
 
The lack of power of the South in world politics, and disparities within the 
South have created divergent interests among member states of the NIEO. 
 
A new economic order, other than NIEO, may emerge from the slowly 
disintegrating neoliberal international economic order that came into being in the 
1980s and 1990s (Chang, 2020). The neoliberal order has been fading and is being 
reshaped. The decline of the multilateral international trading system, the global 
financial crisis in 2008, climate change, the rise of China and the Covid-19 pandemic 
are making the emergence of a new order more likely. 
The BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) was formed in 
2010 to be an alternative to World Bank and IMF to challenge the supremacy of 
the USD, and to provide self-owned and self-managed organizations to develop 
economic plans in its member nations. The New Development Bank (NDB) of the 
BRICS, established in 2014, is a multilateral development bank with the purpose of 
mobilizing resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in 
emerging markets and developing countries.  
Unlike the WBG and the IMF where decision is dictated by the voting power 
of a few member states, in the BRICS bank all members have equal power to decide 
and therefore may be considered as the “bank of equals”. In August 2023, the BRICS 
invited six more countries to join the bloc. As of January 2024, Ethiopia, Egypt, Iran, 
Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Argentina were expected join the bloc 
raising the number of member states to 11. However, Argentina has announced that 
it will not join the BRICS bloc for the fact that it has pledged to pursue closer ties 
with pursue a foreign policy that aligns with western countries, moving away from 
3  
the previous administration’s efforts to build ties with other developing countries 
(BBC, 29 December 2023; Al Jazeera, 29 December 2023). 
The BRICS aims to achieve regional development, to acts as a bridge 
between developed and developing countries, contribute to development of 
humanity, establish a more equitable and fairer world, boost intra-BRICS trade in 
local currencies, promote the technological information exchange among the 
member states; and to enhance inclusive economic growth. 
BRICS has expressed its desire to abandon the USD by 2026. There are high 
chance that the BRICS with 10 nations will minimize paying in the greenback to 
strengthen their local currencies (Dsouza, 2023). If BRICS cuts ties with the USD, 
however, the domestic economies of these countries are expected to face the risk of 
losing investors’ confidence. Investors may not have confidence in the stability of 
“BRICS currency”.  
On the other hand, since the USD has proven to be a stable and reliable 
currency, its abandonment might lead to foreign investors refraining from investing 
in BRICS markets. This development could lead to a dry in foreign cash flow making 
their native economies face severe challenges. The USD is the most widely used 
currency and ending reliance on the greenback could prove BRICS costly. In 
addition, BRICS countries will also have limited access to the dollar markets. 
Generally, BRICS countries could suffer losses if they completely abandon the USD 
for global trade. It could potentially affect their trade balances, investment flows, and 
the overall economic stability of their respective countries. 
Ethiopia’s participation in the BRICS is expected to generate financial and 
technical assistance from the NDB including soft loans without the more stringent 
conditions typically imposed by the IMF (Bonesh, 2023). However, there are diverse 
views on the reasons behind, and the costs and benefits arising from joining the 
BRICS. This study examines the global trends in the NIEO and the likely benefits of 
Ethiopia from joining the BRICS. The specific objectives are to:  
1. Examine the global trends, realization of the objectives of the NIEO, and 
the driving forces for new global economic order; 
2. Identify the expected costs and benefits and the economic and political 
consequences of Ethiopia joining the BRICS; 
3. Evaluate the institutional value of the IFIs (WBG, IMF, BRICS/NDB) 
and the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) in the context of operating 
within BRICS; 
4. Measure the perceived achievement of goals predefined by the financial 
institutions; 
4  
5. Allow experts of economics to contribute to the BRICS policy dialogue 
in Ethiopia; and 
6. Raise public awareness on the benefits and costs of Ethiopia joining the 
BRICS.

2. DATA AND METHODS 
 
Primary data on the views of economists and world development indicators 
were widely utilized to investigate the global dynamics in the NIEO and the 
perception of experts on Ethiopia joining the BRICS.  
 
2.1. Datasets 
 
Primary data was collected using online expert survey questionnaires sent to 
EEA members. The expert survey questionnaire was supported by background 
information on organization, objectives, and governance of the WBG, IMF, NDB, 
and NBE. Responses were received from 233 EEA members (Table 1 & Table 2). 
Outputs of the perception survey were expected to provide helpful insights on the 
potential costs, benefits, threats, institutional trust, and aspirations where policy 
makers should focus and undertake further investigation of the issues and generate 
more reliable scientific evidence for policy making and implementation in Ethiopia.

The expert survey is different from sample survey for the fact that sampling 
frame and sample representation are not required in expert surveys. The views of an 
expert or a few experts are considered adequate and relevant to conclude about the 
subject matter under investigation and the population from which they are selected. 
Experts are assumed to be essentially knowledgeable about the subject matter in 
which they are specialized. The experts were allowed to reflect on the issues they are 
6  
more acquainted with and to skip issues they are less knowledgeable about. More 
number of experts are surveyed to capture the technical difference in their views. 
Unskilled or nonprofessional difference is not expected among the experts.

Secondary data on World Development Indicators (WDI) and governance 
indicators of the IFIs were utilized to investigate the achievement of the objectives 
of the NIEO. The performance of the NIEO over the last 22 years (2001-2022) was 
measured by seven variables defined in Table 3 (WBG, 2023).

2.2. Methods of Data Analysis  
 
Data was analyzed using correlations, two-way scatter plots, percentage of 
responses, and indices. Institutional trust was estimated using a 4-point linear rating 
scale of respondents’ confidence on the financial institutions. 
Goal Achievement Index (GAI) was estimated to measure the achievement 
of institutional goals of financial institutions. The institutional goals are expected to 
be interdependent where the performance of one affect that of the other. Accordingly, 
investigation of the achievement of the WBG, IMF, NDB and the NBE help identify 
the extent of their interdependence in the global financial market. 
To measure the interdependence of these financial institutions, an overall 
goal achievement index was estimated from their specific goals and objectives. The 
perceived goal achievement index (GAI) was aggregated as a geometric mean of 
specific goals/objectives as follows: 
𝐺𝐴𝐼𝑖= 𝑙𝑛(𝑔1 ∗𝑔2,𝑖∗… ∗𝑔𝑛,𝑖)
1
𝑛 
 
where 𝐺𝐴𝐼𝑖 is the goal achievement index for respondent 𝑖; ln is the natural 
logarithm; 𝑔1,𝑖   to  𝑔𝑛,𝑖  are the perceived goal achievement index for goals 1 to n by 
respondent 𝑖; and 𝑛 is the number of specific goals of an institution under 
investigation.

TRENDS IN THE NEW INTERNATIONAL 
ECONOMIC ORDER 
 
The gaps experienced and observed in developed and developing nations have 
verified the flawed achievement of the objectives of the NIEO. This is demonstrated 
by world development indicators analyzed and reported below. 
 
3.1. Governance Gaps 
 
One of the primary objectives of the NIEO is reforming the IFIs and improve the 
governance and decision-making process to better represent the interests of developing 
countries by giving them a greater voice. However, the decision-making power at the 
WBG and the IMF is in the hands of a few member states. In the WBG, out of 189 
countries, the top five have 37 percent and the top 10 countries have 52 percent of 
the total votes. The top 20 countries take the share of 69.3 percent (Figure 1). Around 
162 developing countries have a total vote of only 30% in the bank. Countries with 
higher votes have the power to decide. The plan to empower LDCs in NIEO was not 
realized.

Figure 1: Top 10 countries with high voting power in the WBG (2023) 
 
The distribution of voting power at the IMF is similarly skewed. The lion’s 
share of votes is distributed to similar set of countries in the IMF as well (Figure 2). 
The top five countries take the share of 38.1 percent.  The top 10 countries have a 
share of 52.6% (over half of the total votes). The top 20 countries control two-third 
(68.7%) of the share. The rest 170 countries (89.5% of the members with below 1% 
vote) have a total voting power of 31.3 percent (an average of 0.18% vote each). 
They are members to just to accept decisions made by a few powerful members of 
the Fund. The relative distribution of voting power of all the 190 member states of 
the IMF clearly verifies that LDCs have no considerable participation in the 
governance and decision-making process. The IMF is not reformed to address the 
primary objectives of the NIEO.

Figure 2: Top 10 countries with high voting power in the IMF (2023) 
 
The governance and decision-making in both the WBG and the IMF are 
determined by their share of capital stock. The objective of reforming the IFIs to 
improve the governance and decision-making process was not realized. Though four 
of the founders of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) are still among the top 
10 at the WBG, the governance problem in the WBG and the IMF have driven them 
to establish an alternative IFI governed by equal voting power. In 2001, the BRICS 
and the NDB was formed as an alternative to the World Bank and IMF to challenge 
the supremacy of the USD and to provide self-owned and self-managed 
organization for carrying out development plans in its member nations. 
The New Development Bank (NDB) is a multilateral development bank 
established by BRICS with the purpose of mobilizing resources for infrastructure 
and sustainable development projects in emerging markets and developing countries. 
It has been given $50 billion in initial capital. The NDB   works on an equal-share 
voting basis, with each of the five signatories contributing $10 billion. Every 
member of the BRICS bank (NDB) has one vote and no member would have any 
veto power. Unlike the WBG and the IMF where decision is dictated by the voting 
power of a few member states, the BRICS bank may be considered as the bank of 
equals where all members have equal power to decide.

Out of the top 10 ultimate investors in the BRICS member states, seven of 
them are from Europe and North America (USA, UK, Germany, Netherlands, France, 
Switzerland, Spain) (UN, 2023). These countries are also dominant in the WBG and 
the IMF. Their benefits are substantially overlapping implying that development in 
the BRICS member states is dominated by investments from the western nations. 
Any changes may affect both groups (BRICS and the western powers). 
 
3.2. Output and Income Gaps 
 
Redistribution of wealth between developed and developing nations is one of 
the primary objectives of the NIEO. However, evidence shows that the wealth 
redistribution between the rich and the poor is not realized as stipulated in the NIEO. 
The GDP per capita of high-income countries (HIC) and the least developed 
countries (LDCs) over the two decades shows that the wealth gap between them was 
rather increasing (Figure 3). The gap in GDP per capital between the HIC and the 
LDCs5) is increasing suggesting that the NIEO is not able to realize its objective of 
wealth redistribution. 
 
                                                          
 
5 The United Nations defines LDCs as countries that have low levels of income and face 
severe structural impediments to sustainable development. 
12  
 
Figure 3: GDP per capita gap between HIC and LDCs 
 
3.3. Trade and Export Gaps 
 
The NIEO aims to enhance economic sovereignty of developing nations by 
reducing their dependence on developed countries through trade between them. 
However, the trend in the last two decades clearly shows the increasing and widening 
trade gap between HIC and LDCs (left and right panel of Figure 4).  Under the NIEO, 
LDCs are not able to equitably benefit from international trade. 
 
13  
 
Figure 4: Trade gap between HIC and LDCs 
 
Like the overall trade gap presented above, export by HIC and LDCs has similar 
patterns over the last 22 years. As shown in Figure 5, the export gap between HIC 
and LDCs is widening as well as increasing (left and right panel of Figure 5). The 
NIEO has failed to enhance trade and investment in LDCs. 
 
Figure 5: Export gap between HIC and LDC 
14  
The external balance on goods and services (% of GDP) between HIC and 
LDCs was widening over the last 22 years (Figure 6). Moreover, the HIC have higher 
and positive extremal balance whereas LDCs have experienced negative external 
balance. The gap between HIC and LDCs has been aggravated. 
 
Figure 6: Dynamics of external balance between HIC and LDCs 
 
3.4. FDI Flows  
 
The inflow and outflow of net foreign direct investment (FDI) in LDCs did not 
show significant improvement over the last two decades (Figure 7). Inflow of FDI in 
HIC and LDCs is substantially fluctuating with negligible positive effect on 
redistribution of wealth between developed and underdeveloped nations around the 
world. 
 
15  
 
Figure 7: FDI inflow gap between HIC and LDCs 
 
Over the last 22 years, the outflow of FDI in LDCs is significantly lower 
than the outflow in HIC (Figure 8). There is substantial gap in FDI outflow between 
HIC and LDCs with increasing gap in recent years. High income countries are not 
able to enhance FDI in LDCs and ensure growth and development under the 
framework of the NIEO. 
16  
Figure 8: FDI outflow gap between HIC and LDCs 
 
The global failure to realize the four objectives of the NIEO over the last two decades 
clearly verifies the urgent need to reform the western IFIs and/or the formation of 
alternative economic blocks around the world. Reforming the western IFIs and the 
formation of new blocs are expected to address previous limitations of the WBG and 
the IMF associated with governance, wealth redistribution, economic sovereignty, 
and south-south collaboration.

PERCEPTIONS ON BRICS 
 
The views of EEA members on the reasons behind joining the BRICS, the 
expected costs and benefits, and the consequences and the associated risks arising 
from joining the BRICS are investigated and reported hereunder.  
   
4.1. 
Why BRICS for Ethiopia? 
 
There is no common understanding on the reasons why Ethiopia had applied 
to join the BRICS. Experts perceive that economic and political sanctions, its 
emerging economy, geopolitics, deteriorating relation with the western powers in 
recent times, and external intervention are the top five reasons that had driven 
Ethiopia to apply and join the BRICS (Figure 9). Very small minority (2.6%) of the 
experts also have expressed other reasons including diverting attention from the 
internal political problem the regime is failing to handle, international trade and a 
move towards a multipolar world, alternative source of finance and expecting power 
shift from West to East, trade integration and facilitation of common currency among 
member states, and diversification of economic partnership. 
 
 
Figure 9: Reasons for Ethiopia to apply and join the BRICS 
 
18  
Common agenda, such as inclusive development, equity, trade partnership, 
the desire to use local currency for international trade, and technological information 
exchange among member states are important for the performance and sustainability 
of economic blocs.  
The experts suggest that presence of common agenda among member states 
of the BRICS is higher than member states of the WBG and IMF (Table 4). To be 
specific, 60.3 percent of the experts perceive that member states of the WBG have 
no or fewer common agenda whereas 52.3 percent perceive that the BRICS member 
states have more common agenda.

4.2. 
Benefits and Costs 
 
De-dollarization, a process of moving away from reliance on the USD as 
the chief reserve currency, is one of the instruments BRICS intends to assert its 
global position and create opportunities for member states to trade and to conduct 
other financial transactions with their local currencies (Bromberg & Miller, 2023). 
The BRICS bank has revealed a 3-year de-dollarization initiative to switch away 
from the USD. Joining the BRICS is also expected to help mobilize additional source 
of development finance for new and emerging economies like Ethiopia.  
There is no clear understanding on whether the NDB will be able to realize 
its de-dollarization initiative. However, majority of the respondents (68.6%) concur 
with de-dollarization initiatives of the NDB. About 61.0 percent also perceive the 
BRICS will abandon the US dollar. The timeline for de-dollarization varies between 
five and 15+ year as shown in Table 5.

Economists (45.9%) say that the selection criteria to join the BRICS is not 
clear. However, great majority (73.8%) support Ethiopia’s decision to apply and join 
the BRICS. Respondents expect that economic benefits (69.7%) and political costs 
(66.8%) outweigh other costs and benefits of joining the BRICS (Figure 10). 
Moreover, nearly half of the respondents (47%) perceive that Ethiopia will incur 
economic costs.  
 
 
Figure 10: Perceived benefits and costs of joining the BRICS 
 
Overall, the majority (50.9%) expect that Ethiopia will gain net benefits due 
to its decision to join the BRICS (Figure 11). The rest (49.1%) perceive that either 
costs outweigh benefits or difficult to understand and calculate it (18.8%). 
20  
 
Figure 11: Perceived net benefits and costs of joining the BRICS 
 
4.3. 
Consequences of Joining the BRICS  
 
Following its entry into BRICS, 73.4 percent of respondents perceive that 
Ethiopia will face several adverse measures from the western powers. This includes 
refusal or reduction of new loans and grants (55.6%), financial disbursement 
problems (42.7%), and pressure from the WBG and the IMF for devaluation of its 
local currency (39.7%) (Table 6). Substantial political measures and pressure on FDI 
(37.5%) are also expected from the western powers.

The EEA member economists perceive that BRICS will face several challenges. The 
top three challenges are influence from the WBG and IMF, conflicts of political 
interest among BRICS members, and limited financial capacity of the BRICS to 
support emerging economies like Ethiopia (Figure 12). 
 
21  
 
Figure 12: Expected challenges adversely affecting achievement of BRICS goals 
 
4.4. Banking System 
 
A financial system is a set of institutions (such as banks, insurance 
companies, and stock exchanges) that permit the exchange of funds. A well-
functioning financial system is expected to have complete markets with effective 
financial intermediaries and financial instruments allowing investors to move money 
from the present to the future, borrowers to easily obtain capital, and hedgers to offset 
risks. Development of financial markets in Ethiopia requires a good banking system 
comparable to member states of the BRICS.  
The institutional trust and people’s confidence in the IFIs is related to their 
performance and sustainability. Experts’ confidence in the IFIs (WBG, IMF and the 
BRICS bank) is estimated to be higher than the NBE (Figure 13). More specifically, 
64.5 percent of the experts expressed high confidence in the BRICS bank followed 
by the WBG and the IMF (58.2%), and the NBE (57.1%).  
 
22  
 
Figure 13: State of institutional trust on the financial institutions  
 
The level of achievement of predefined goals and objectives of the 
international financial institutions and the NBE were perceived to be generally low. 
The goal achievement index (GAI) shows the BRICS is less likely to realize its goals 
(Figure 14). The GAI for the BRICS is low (29.9%), whereas that for the WBG 
(45.0%) and the IMF (46.8%) are relatively better. Following the BRICS, the NBE 
is the second bottom financial institution with the lowest GAI (43.2%) and social 
trust to realize its institutional goals. 
 
23  
 
Figure 14: Perceived goal achievement by financial institutions 
 
 
The results strongly verify that Ethiopia is expected to reform its financial 
system and strengthen its capacity to the level comparable to member states of the 
BRICS. Ensuring the legal and actual independence of the NBE is the other priority 
required to reform the banking sector and to benefit from the expected opportunities 
in the BRICS.  
 
4.5. 
Interdependence of Financial Institutions 
 
Financial institutions with more common agenda, overlapping or related 
objectives, and governance system are perceived to be strongly interdependent in 
their goal achievements. As shown in Figure 15, the link between goal achievements 
of the WBG and the IMF verifies that they are strongly interdependent institutions 
with 79 percent strong linear association in the achievement of their institutional 
goals.  
24  
 
Figure 15: Goal achievement by WBG and IMF are strongly interdependent 
 
Similarly, the link between goal achievements of the WBG and the BRICs 
was analyzed and found to have nonlinear, relatively lower positive association 
(r=0.211) (Figure 16).  The link between achievement of institutional goals by the 
WBG and the BRICS is not strong and direct mainly because they have few common 
agenda, different objectives, and governance system. 
 
 
 
 
 
25  
Figure 16: Goal achievements by WBG and BRICS have weak association 
The interdependence between the BRICS and the NBE was also investigated 
by the association between their goal achievements measured by the GAI (Figure 
17). The achievement of goals by the NBE is exponentially associated with that of 
the BRICS implying that the NBE (and Ethiopia) will benefit from the BRICS to 
realize its institutional and national objectives. 
 
26  
 
Figure 17: Goal achievements by NBE and BRICS are exponentially linked 
 
The evidence also shows that the NBE is directly dependent on the WBG to 
achieve its objectives (Figure 18). The NBE is less likely to realize its institutional 
goals without its existing partners (WBG and IMF). At least in shortrun, the NBE is 
expected to work with the existing two IFIs while strengthening its link with the new 
bloc (BRICS).

CONCLUDING REMARKS 
 
The NIEO was intended to reform the IFIs, redistribute wealth between 
developed and developing nations, and to enhance economic sovereignty and south-
south collaboration. However, evidence shows that the primary objectives of the 
NIEO were not realized over the last two decades. Wealth and governance gaps 
between developed and developing nations were rather widening. Their gaps in 
output and income was substantially widening. Gaps in GDP shares of trade, export, 
and external balance between developed and developing nations significantly 
increased over the period. 
The global failure to realize the objectives of the NIEO is believed to have 
led developing nations and emerging economies to look for alternative financial 
institutions and economic blocs suitable for realizing their overriding development 
objectives. Formation of the BRICS is the first of its kind initiated to play this role 
in the international economic system. The expansion of the BRICS membership is 
suffocated with and overwhelmed by diverse perceptions about the costs and benefits 
of countries joining the bloc. Though there is substantial overlap of positive 
expectations by joining countries, they are also expected to face several threats 
related to trade, investment, aid, development assistance, and foreign exchange. 
Ethiopia, as an upcoming member of the BRICS, is perceived to have joined 
the bloc mainly driven by political and economic challenges the regime is currently 
facing. There are several issues which require further investigation of the tangible 
benefits, costs, and requirements/preparedness. The following recommendations are 
drawn from the findings. 
1. Flawed implementation of the NIEO calls the need to identify and join new 
alternative economic blocs. If the WBG and the IMF are not committed to 
undertake significant reforms, nations with common agenda are more likely 
to identify and establish new economic blocs and ensure realization of their 
development objectives.    
2. Ethiopia should conduct rigorous investigation of the economic, political, 
and overall effects and risks of joining the BRICS and make final decisions 
on how to proceed with the BRICS and the western powers. 
3. Given its current state of domestic and global economic and political 
challenges and international relations, Ethiopia should work with both the 
BRICS and the western IFIs at least in shortrun. 
29  
a. Trading with local currencies among member states of the BRICS 
requires new trading partners. It also takes time to identify and 
collaborate with new trading partners.  
b. Ethiopia is suffering from serious forex constraint. Acceptance of its 
local currency (ETB) by member states in the bloc is also less likely. 
Ethiopia is not in a position to benefits from international trade with 
local currencies for the fact that trading with local currencies 
aggravates the existing forex constraint and constrains trade with 
other partners using the USD.  
4. Due to its poor achievement of predefined objectives, the NBE is given low 
institutional trust and value. Ethiopian is required to take relevant reform and 
policy measures and create vibrant banking system and financial markets 
comparable to that of member states in the BRICS.
