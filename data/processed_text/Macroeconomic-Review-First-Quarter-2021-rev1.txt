While most macro indicators for the first quarter of 2021 showed a recovery from COVID-
related shocks, the economic outlook has since become clouded by on-going impacts from 
the recent conflict, heightened geo-political tensions, and rising risks to external funding. 
Still, we think it is probably too early to assume there will be materially negative macro 
impacts for the upcoming fiscal year (July 2021-June 2022), as current geo-political tensions 
may turn out to be short-lived, economic reform initiatives could see improved momentum 
post-election, and potential declines in foreign funding—should they materialize—will be at 
least partly offset by other fx inflows such as privatization, the IMF’s new SDR allocation, 
and improving exports/services/remittances. As important, policy decisions and directions 
adopted in the coming months will be key in setting the path for macro outcomes in the new 
fiscal year. Accordingly, we await the release of the 2021-22 Budget Document as well as 
the start of the fiscal year before fully revisiting our macro projections, and keep unchanged 
for now most of our current fiscal year estimates and year-ahead forecasts. 
 
§ Growth: We are now more confident of our 4% GDP growth projection for the just-   
ending fiscal year and somewhat less confident of our 7.5% growth projection for the 
upcoming fiscal year. Recently released crop data reveal growth of 2 percent in this 
year’s main harvest (from 335mn to 342mn quintals) and this, together with anticipated 
growth rates of around 8 percent for industry and 4 percent for services now makes it 
almost certain that the current fiscal year (July 2020-June 2021) will register GDP growth 
that is at or slightly above 4 percent. The estimated growth rates for industry and 
services are plausible, in our view, considering nine-month outturns seen in bank 
lending, tax collections, and construction sector activity. Looking ahead, while our 
previous forecast was for 7.5 percent growth in the coming fiscal year, the outlook is 
now more uncertain. On the positive front, forecasts of above-average rainfall suggest 
good outturns for the upcoming crop season, multiple agriculture-related policy 
initiatives (expanded use of fertilizers, irrigation, cluster farming, modern machinery) 
continue to support growth in crop volumes/yields, and further expansion can 
reasonably be expected in industry/services given the post-COVID recovery, strong 
private sector credit growth, and the launch of new public sector projects under the new 
Ten Year Development Plan. At the same time, the on-going repercussions from the 
recent conflict and associated geo-political tensions with the US/EU could adversely 
impact investor sentiment and reduce some portion of foreign assistance (including 
possibly multilateral flows and debt relief), with attendant impacts for growth in public 
investment,  industry, and services. Greater clarity in these areas will be possible only 
following developments over the coming months, i.e., post- budget, post-election, and 
depending on how the currently elevated geo-political tensions eventually play out. 
 
§ Inflation: We have continued to under-estimate the persistence of inflation and this past  
quarter was no different, with inflation remaining near 20% despite our expectations 
that it would drop to the low teens by now. Virtually all key inflation drivers appear to 
have played a part over the past few months, including supply-side shocks (due to 
conflict-related disruptions and transport fleet diversions), rapid growth in money 
supply (up 28 percent), rising imported commodity prices (up 15-20 percent even in 
dollar terms), and a sizeable Birr depreciation (26 percent on a year-on-year basis).

The role of imported inflation appears to have been particularly significant this past 
quarter, with high price increases seen for fuel (up 41%), re-bars (up 32%), fertilizers (up 
32%), and wheat (up 20%). One positive aspect of latest inflation data has been a decline 
in April’s month-on-month inflation, which fell sharply to 0.8 percent (10% annualized) 
from average monthly rates of 2-3 percent in the prior three months. However, even a 
continuation of the recent reduced monthly rate of price increases (which is far from 
certain given still-strong imported price pressures) would lower inflation only slightly to 
17 percent by June 2021 and to 15 percent by December 2021. In short, inflation is 
unlikely to fall below the mid-teens for the remainder of 2021.  
 
§ Fiscal policy: While budget execution data showed significant under-spending up to 
December 2020, the latest figures on government financing suggest that the fiscal deficit 
is likely to end up very close to its budgeted figure of Birr 126bn (3.1% of GDP).  
Government spending as of end-December 2020 was held below budgeted levels, at just 
Birr 215bn for the six months or just 45 percent of the Birr 476bn full year allocation. 
The budget deficit for the first half of the year was only Birr 41bn versus a budgeted year 
total figure of birr 126bn—or only 33 percent of the full year figure. This significant 
under-spending in the first six months has allowed for large unanticipated expenditures 
that have subsequently been allocated for exceptional outlays in recent months. 
Reflecting these developments, more recent nine-month data point to a deficit of 
around Birr 91bn, by our estimates, based on the change in the stock of domestic debt 
(up by Birr 66bn in the last nine months) and in external borrowing (up by a net of 
$667mn or Birr 25bn over the same period).  At around 72 percent of the annual deficit 
figure for the first nine months (91bn vs 126bn), it appears the annual deficit will be 
close to its budgeted figure of near 3 percent of GDP. With this deficit figure, and given 
a nominal GDP of Birr 4.2 trillion this year, the debt ratio at end-June 2021 should remain 
roughly unchanged from its level of a year ago, or around 51 percent of GDP. A rising 
share of the government’s domestic debt is now financed via Treasury Bills, and in fact 
70 percent of government’s new domestic borrowing (Birr 46bn out of Birr 66bn as of 
March 2021) is now taking place at market interest rates, which have reached double-
digit levels for the first time in the auction’s history. This policy shift brings with it a 
somewhat higher cost of borrowing for the government (10 percent effective rate across 
all T-Bill maturities), but it is at the same time welcome for making possible properly 
functioning money markets and for helping better reflect the opportunity costs of funds 
invested by banks and pension funds.  
 
§ Banking: The banking sector continues to show strong year-on-year growth in deposits 
and in lending, both of which are up around 28 percent from year ago levels. Growth 
rates were even stronger at private banks (where deposits were up 40 percent and 
lending up 46 percent from year-ago levels), while CBE showed a slowdown in credit 
growth despite a 20 percent growth in deposits.  The likelihood of a major NPL problem 
at private banks still appears very low and most banks are, in any case, well-provisioned 
and well-capitalized for any surprises on this front. Nine-month data suggest record 
levels of income and profits will be reported by both the public and private banks when 
they close their financial year at the end of June 2021.  
 
§ Balance of Payments: Contrary to our expectations, fx reserves have been under 
pressure over the past quarter, and official NBE reserves declined to $2.5bn as of end-
March 2021 (down by $550mn from the prior quarter but roughly the same as a year 
ago). By contrast, commercial bank reserves rose to $1.3bn as of end-March 2021 and 
are up $230mn for the quarter and $600mn for the year. The decline in official fx

reserves relative to expectations reflects delays in IMF disbursements ($448mn) and a 
pause in US/EU budgetary support (on the order of $240mn), both of which have not 
been offset by better-than-expected performance seen for exports, airline receipts, and 
remittances. FDI has performed reasonably well, with nine-month data pointing to 
$2.1bn in inflows, while industrial park exports have recently surpassed their pre-COVID 
levels (reaching $17mn per month in March 2021 vs a low-point of just $7mn following 
the onset of the COVID pandemic in April 2020). Looking ahead, fx reserves should get a 
big boost in June 2021 from the recently completed telecom license sale ($850mn) and 
will also likely be supported in the coming months by forthcoming inflows from a second 
telecom sale (likely to be at least $850mn), from the 40% equity sale of ethio telecom 
(potentially well above $1bn), and from the IMF’s SDR allocation ($430mn likely by 
August 2021). These inflows could compensate for potential declines in grants and loans 
in the coming fiscal year, thus leaving fx reserves broadly in the range of $3.0bn to 
$3.5bn (2.7 to 3.2 months import cover), but there are considerable uncertainties on the 
prospects for external financing flows linked to grants from bilateral partners, loans from 
multilateral institutions, and debt service relief under the G20 ‘Common Framework’ 
scheme. Accordingly, we keep largely unchanged our previous BOP projections until 
revisiting this next quarter when the scope of potential funding gaps is likely to become 
apparent. It is nonetheless worth noting that, even with the large fx sums anticipated 
above (from the telecom license sales, part privatization, IMF SDR funds), these 
exceptional inflows are directed to public sector accounts (i.e., to the central bank), 
making any large infusion of fx funds into the private banking system unlikely and thus 
implying that there will not be much relief for businesses facing prolonged fx waiting 
times at commercial banks.   
 
§ Exchange rate: The central bank appears to still be following an exchange rate policy 
that aims to avoid any real appreciation of the currency by fully offsetting inflation 
differentials with trading partners. Accordingly, recent months have continued to show 
nominal rates of depreciation that have moved to compensate for observed inflation 
outturns plus some small margin.  Rates of annual depreciation in recent months have 
turned out somewhat higher than what we anticipated (25% actual vs 22% projected for 
April 2021), but this is consistent with inflation that was also similarly above our 
expectations (19% actual  vs 16% projected).  With the fiscal year now likely to end at an 
exchange rate of 44 Birr/USD (June 2021), and consistent with a slower anticipated 
decline in inflation from here on (i.e. inflation is very likely to remain in the mid-teens 
till end-2021), we now expect depreciation rates will stay within the range of 20-25 
percent on a year-on-year basis for the next six months, thus implying a rate of near 47 
Birr/USD by end-December 2021. 
 
A summary of our full set of macroeconomic projections—largely unchanged from 
our 2021 Macroeconomic Handbook publication—is provided in the attached Annex. 
We will revisit our projections more fully in the next Quarterly Macro Review.

ECONOMIC ACTIVITY—Recent Developments:  
 
§ 
The Central Statistical Authority has 
just released final crop estimates for 
the current fiscal year, with figures 
showing 
34.2mn 
tons 
of 
total 
agricultural production, or growth of 2 
percent from last year’s 33.5mn tons. 
 
§ 
Earlier forecasts from the Ministry of 
Agriculture officials had suggested 
that crop outturns may reach as high 
as 37mn tons, but actual outturns 
have turned out lower. 
 
§ 
Seen by the major crop categories, the 
highest growth rates were registered 
in the production of pulses (6.5%) and 
in cereals (1.8%). The output of 
oilseeds fell by nearly 8 percent 
compared to the prior year’s outturns. 
 
 
 
§ 
This year’s 2 percent growth in crop 
output is the slowest seen in five 
years, and only one-third of the 6 
percent 
average 
annual 
growth 
registered over the past decade. 
 
§ 
Still, this year’s crop growth is 
noteworthy 
when 
seen 
against 
multiple adverse shocks experienced 
during the year—including locust 
invasions, 
conflict, 
and 
harvest 
disruptions. Offsetting these adverse 
impacts were the positive effects of 
favourable rains, increased acreage 
farmed, higher fertilizer use, and 
greater reliance on irrigation as well as 
commercialized cluster farming.

Recent developments … 
 
§ A closer look at trends in cereals crop 
production show falling teff output 
(down 4%), which has been offset by a 
much larger maize harvest (up 10%) as 
well as higher wheat production (up 9%).  
 
§ Maize production in Ethiopia—at 106mn 
quintals—is now close to double that of 
either teff or wheat, and has become by 
far the single largest cereal crop. Ethiopia 
also remains among the continent’s 
largest maize producers, after only South 
Africa (113mn quintals) and Nigeria 
(110mn quintals). 
 
§ For pulses, outturns were driven by 6 
percent higher output for faba beans, 
which comprise one-third of this sub-
category. Other large increases were 
seen for soya beans, white chick peas, 
and red haricot beans,  
 
§ Oilseeds output fell almost across the 
board, including for sesame (-1%, 
reflecting the conflict in key production 
regions), sunflower seeds, and neug.

Recent Developments …  
 
§ 
 Outside of agriculture, activity 
indicators for the first nine months 
of the fiscal year point to increases—
in real terms—in power generation, 
bank deposit, bank loans, state 
enterprise 
revenue, 
and 
remittances. 
 
§ 
Notable declines were registered—
when comparing this fiscal year’s 
nine months to that of the prior 
year—in fuel consumption, FDI, 
industrial park exports, and tourism 
arrivals. 
 
§ 
Several of the indicators showing 
negative nine-month growth rates 
nonetheless 
show 
sequential 
improvement, i.e., when looking at 
monthly trends since the same 
period last year (see next page).  
 
 
 
 
 
§ 
Investment indicators/proxies show 
a mixed picture, with public sector 
investment metrics showing positive 
growth for the first half of the year. 
At the same time capital goods 
imports showed continued declines 
(14 percent), as did FDI inflows 
which reached only $2.1bn in the 
nine months to March 2021 and are 
down 13 percent from year-ago 
levels.  
 
§ 
The decline in FDI is arguably not as 
severe as might have been expected 
given global conditions with the 
COVID pandemic as well as domestic 
conditions.

Activity Indicators—monthly trends …  
§ 
Monthly indicators show industrial park exports exceeding pre-covid levels for the first time, overall exports and 
remittances continuing to rise, tourism inflows reaching close to pre-covid norms, and still-strong deposit 
growth. At the same time, revenue levels  and credit growth are slowing partly due to seasonal factors.

Growth estimates and outlook … 
§ 
On the basis of 2 percent growth in 
agriculture, 4 percent growth in services, 
and 9 percent growth in industry (the 
latter mostly driven by construction), we 
estimate this year’s overall GDP growth 
will reach at least four percent. 
 
§ 
There is some over-performance possible 
in services growth which could bring 
growth closer to 5 percent for this year. 
 
§ 
 For the year-ahead, while we will revisit  
our projections more fully in July-August, 
our previous projection of 7.5 percent 
reflected continued recovery from COVID 
shocks for the services sector (expected 
to grow by 7 percent), 11 percent 
expansion in industry (reflecting FDI and 
public 
investment), 
and 
continued 
increases in farm output (forecast to rise 
4.5 percent) due to many wide-ranging 
initiatives to boost acreage farmed, 
fertilizer use, irrigation, and cluster 
farming. 
 
§ 
Current downside risks are that: (1) farm 
output may be lower due to a disrupted 
planting season in Northern Ethiopia; (2) 
construction/industrial activity may show 
slower growth due to shortfalls in 
fiscal/external financing and thus slower 
expansion in public investment and FDI, 
and; (3)  services growth may be more 
limited due to a slower rebound (partly 
conflict-related) in tourism and domestic 
retail activity.  
 
§ 
Projections 
by 
various 
external 
institutions point to an average expected 
growth rate of 6.6 percent for the 
upcoming fiscal year, though most of 
these reflect forecasts from early 2021.

Overall GDP Growth:
7.5
            
Overall GDP growth reflects sub-component growth rates (see below) and real 
GDP weights of 32.7% for agriculture, 31.6% for industry (including 
construction), and 35.7% for services
Agriculture
4.5
            
Multiple initiatives underway to expand acreage farmed and implement yield-
boosting improvements through expanded use of fertilizers, irrigation, cluster 
farming, and modern machinery.
Industry
11.2
          
Construction sector likely to show continued double-digit growth on account 
of increased public sector projects in line with budget (roads, housing, etc) as 
well as private projects supported by high bank credit growth to the sector and 
rapid urbanization. Industrial Park data point to a rising momentum in recent 
export/production volumes. Mining and Power sectors also increasingly more 
significant contributors to industry sector reflecting recent/on-going private 
and public investments in these areas. 
Services
7.0
            
Public administration and social services (health, education) expected to rise 
in line with government budgets and expanding population demands. Tourism 
figures point to recovery from post-COVID lows, boosting the hotels/restaurant 
sub-sector. Wholesale/retail trade to grow in line with broader 
agricultural/industrial activity, while financial sector should continue strong 
growth trends of recent years given still unmet demands.

PRICES AND INFLATION: Recent Developments and Outlook 
Inflation outturns: 
 
§ 
Inflation over the last quarter has 
remained in the range of 19-20 
percent, as has been the case for the 
last 18 months now. 
 
§ 
The same three main commodity 
groups—namely 
bread/cereals, 
vegetables, and housing/utility/fuel 
expenses—remain the main sources 
of inflation.   
 
§ 
Commodities 
that 
are 
mainly 
imported 
showed 
the 
highest 
inflation rates of near 25 percent, a 
rate similar to the year-on-year Birr 
depreciation of 25 percent as of April 
2021.  
 
§ 
Domestic 
services 
showed 
the 
lowest inflation rates of just 9 
percent, 
mainly 
reflecting 
a 
moderation of housing/utility price 
increases after very large increases 
in late 2020 and early 2021.  
 
 
§ 
The role of cereals and  vegetables 
continues to be significant in driving 
inflation, given their large weight in 
the index. Excluding these two line 
items shows inflation at around 13 
percent.

Prices and Inflation… continued: 
§ 
Ranked by year-on-year inflation rates, 
cooking oil and dairy product prices show 
the largest increases (34%), followed by 
health 
service 
fees, 
bread/cereals, 
transport (all above 25%). 
 
§ 
Products registered below-average price 
increases were education fees, sugar, fish, 
vegetables, and meat.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
§ 
Seen on a month-on-month basis, 
inflation has shown a very welcome drop, 
with only a 0.8 percent average price 
increase between March and April 2021.  
 
§ 
The 
latest 
month-on-month 
price 
increase is around half the monthly 
inflation of 1.5% registered over the past 
year and, if sustained, would imply 
annualized inflation of just 10 percent.

Prices and Inflation… continued 
 
§ 
Differences in regional inflation have 
narrowed 
somewhat 
in 
recent 
months, with the gap between the 
highest and lowest regions now 
standing at 12 percentage points (25 
percent in SNNP vs 13 percent in 
Amhara) vs 17 percentage points in 
late 2020. 
 
§ 
SNNP is now the region showing the 
highest inflation rate, while Tigray had 
until 
recently 
been 
the 
region 
exhibiting the highest inflation.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Inflation Outlook: 
§ 
While the recent drop in monthly  
inflation is encouraging, the continued 
impact of imported price inflation and 
the fact that June-August are the lean 
(pre-harvest) months for crop supplies 
suggests that inflationary pressures 
are unlikely to ease in the immediate 
period ahead.  
 
§ 
We expect month-on-month inflation 
of between 1.0 to 1.5 percent for each 
of the coming five months (roughly in 
line with seasonal norms), followed by 
negative monthly inflation starting in 
October 2021 reflecting the typical 
post-harvest price movements.  
 
§ 
Based on this assumed profile for 
monthly price developments, year-on-
year inflation would still remain at a 
high of 17 percent by end-June 2021 
and remain close to 15 percent even 
by  end-December 2021.

MONETARY POLICY: Recent developments and outlook 
 
Money supply developments: 
 
§ 
Monetary growth accelerated this 
past quarter, with broad money 
supply up 28 percent or the highest 
rate of expansion seen in three years. 
 
§ 
The growth rate of broad money is 
now 
well 
beyond—and 
likely 
contributing to—inflation rates of 
near 20 percent.  
 
Monetary growth: 
 
§ 
Reserve 
money 
growth 
has 
moderated somewhat to 19 percent 
(down from recent growth rates of 30-
plus 
percent) 
but 
remains 
comparatively high. 
 
§ 
The Government-IMF macro program 
had 
anticipated 
reserve 
money 
growth being limited to just 10 
percent. Even after some allowance 
for post-COVID monetary loosening, 
the current rate of growth appears 
well above those planned targets.  
 
 
§ 
Credit growth has been the main 
driver of money supply growth, with 
several sectors such as exports, 
transport, 
mining/power, 
and 
construction seeing growth rates in 
excess of 50 percent on a year-on-year 
basis.   
 
§ 
Excluding government, the sector 
receiving the largest share of bank 
credit has now become mines/power 
(Birr 317bn and 18% of total), though 
it had been industry for a very long 
time.  Other large credit users are 
construction, exports, and domestic 
trade each with at least Birr 100bn 
outstanding.

Monetary and banking developments… 
 
§ 
Bond issuance by state enterprises has 
picked up strongly in recent months, 
most 
notably 
by 
the 
Railway 
Corporation which now shows Birr 69bn 
in bonds issued to the banking system. 
 
§ 
Issuance by the Addis Ababa City 
Government has also jumped to Birr 
56bn as of December 2020, nearly 
double the outstanding stock a year 
earlier, and presumably directed to 
many public investment projects under 
implementation 
throughout 
the 
municipality. 
 
 
§ 
Deposit expansion has continued in line 
with recent quarters, and reached Birr 
1.27 trillion as of March 2021. The 
growth rate of deposits is the highest 
seen in more than three years.  
 
§ 
Private banks continue to make gains in 
market share, with their share of total 
deposits reaching 45 percent, up from 
41 percent a year ago. 
 
§ 
Banks are moderating their branch 
expansions, with growth in bank 
branches halving to just 11 percent now 
vs 22 percent growth seen a year ago.  
 
§ 
Looking at quarterly growth trends over 
time, deposit growth is slightly above its 
three 
year 
average 
while 
credit 
growth—despite a slowdown this past 
quarter—is roughly in line with its 
recent growth.

FISCAL POLICY: Recent developments  
 
Revenue performance 
 
§ 
Revenue collections continue to show 
strong nominal growth, rising 16 percent in 
the first nine months. This is, however, now 
below recent rates of inflation and is thus 
equivalent to a slight decline in real terms. 
 
§ 
However, just looking at domestic taxes, 
there is strong nominal and real growth and 
suggests expanding domestic economic 
activity. The fall in trade taxes (despite a 26 
percent year-on-year depreciation) reflects 
the significant fall in overall imports. 
 
 
§ 
Seen on a quarterly basis, revenue data for 
Jan-March 2021 show a seasonal decline, 
but are up 14 percent in nominal terms 
from year ago levels (Birr 63bn vs Birr 
56bn). The bulk of annual revenue 
collection continues to take place in the 
July-December months of the fiscal year.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
§ 
Looking at the overall budgetary trends 
based on six-month data (latest available), 
revenue collections are roughly on track 
with the budget while expenditure shows 
significant underspending relative to the 
budget. 
 
§ 
The overall budget deficit for the first six 
months was only Birr 41bn, equivalent to 
1% GDP or just 33 percent of the planned 
year-total figure. This suggests that the 
overall budget deficit target of near 3 
percent for this year is unlikely to be 
surpassed.

T-Bill Market Developments: 
 
Volumes… 
 
§ 
Net T-Bills issued under the auction-based 
system reached close to Birr 69 bn as of end-
March 2021, from just Birr 24bn at the start 
of the fiscal year. The two main T-Bill 
maturities outstanding are 182-day Bills (44% 
of total) followed by 91-Day Bills (30%).  
 
§ 
The Birr 46bn in net T-Bills issued for the first 
nine months of the fiscal year corresponds to 
37 percent of the planned budget deficit of 
Birr 126bn.  About Birr 20bn of the Birr 46bn 
net T-Bill increase (or 44%) represents 
commercial bank purchases; the remainder 
reflects mostly pension fund purchases.  
 
Yields… 
 
§ 
Yields have trended upwards for all three 
categories of T-Bills, with the highest change 
seen in 91-day Bills whose yield has now 
passed 14 percent as of end-May 2021 from 
just 6 percent in June 2020.  
 
§ 
The effective cost—for Government—of T-
Bill related borrowing (across all  maturities) 
has now reached 10 percent from just 6 
percent at the start of the year.  
 
§ 
Auction participants appear to be recognizing 
that high inflation and the opportunity cost 
of their funds merit higher yields, while the 
central bank has tolerated the higher rates 
despite the increased costs for government.   
 
§ 
Commercial 
banks 
continue 
to 
be 
concentrated in shorter maturity T-Bills.  
Banks hold more than 90 percent of the 
outstanding 28-day Bills, but only 20 percent 
of 182-day Bills and none of the 364-day Bills. 
T-Bill maturities where bank bids are most 
concentrated (the 28-day and 91-day T-Bills) 
have shown the largest increase yields over 
the past year.

Public debt, in USD terms: 
 
§ 
Latest debt data for end-March 2021 show 
total public sector debt declining slightly to 
$53.9bn, with nearly 55 percent of this total 
representing external debt. 
 
§ 
The decline in the USD value of debt has 
come from a fall in the dollar value of 
domestic public debt, as the depreciation of 
the Birr has reduced the USD value of Birr-
denominated debt. 
 
 
Public debt, relative to GDP: 
 
§ 
Expressed relative to GDP, public debt now 
stands at just 51 percent of GDP (using the 
March 2021 debt figure and estimated 
2020-21 USD GDP). Even with some new 
debt accumulation in the final quarter of 
the fiscal year, the public debt to GDP ratio 
is likely to end the fiscal year at or below 51 
percent of GDP. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
External debt stocks 
 
§ 
Public external debt has trended up in the 
last two years (from $27.1bn in June 2019 
to $29.4bn at present), reflecting large 
multilateral loan disbursements following 
much stronger engagements with the IMF 
and World Bank. 
 
§ 
Relative to USD GDP, the external debt ratio 
is now essentially unchanged from its level 
of two years ago, and stands at 28 percent 
of GDP.

External debt service … 
 
§ 
Debt service data for the first nine months 
of the fiscal year show $1.4bn in total 
principal and interest payments.  
 
§ 
Most external debt service repayments 
($1,249mn out of $1,429mn) continue to 
reflect repayments of state enterprise debt. 
Government external debt repayments are 
only 13 percent of the total.  
 
 
 
 
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS (BOP): Recent developments  
 
§ 
BOP data for the first six months of the 
fiscal year show a $306mn reserves loss, 
reflecting a $1.3bn current account deficit, 
a $1.3 bn capital account surplus, and 
errors 
and 
omissions 
term  
(unaccounted/unrecorded 
items) 
of 
around $300mn.  
 
§ 
The current account deficit has fallen to 
one of its lowest levels in recent years, 
reflecting a shrinking trade deficit, a 
positive services balance, and an improved 
level of private and public transfers (as of 
end-2020).  
 
§ 
In the capital account, the main inflows 
continue to be FDI ($1.3bn over the six 
months) and external borrowing ($0.5bn 
over the same period).

FX reserves: 
 
§ 
Trends in official fx reserves 
show latest levels at roughly 
where they were a year ago, 
namely near $2.5bn. Reserves 
are down from the recent highs 
of near $3.2bn registered in 
June and September 2020.  
 
§ 
Trends in commercial banks’ fx 
reserves are up notably from 
year-ago levels ($1.3bn at 
March 2021 vs $0.8bn a year 
ago), but still not from their 
near $1bn average seen in 
recent.  
 
 
TRADE PERFORMANCE: Recent developments 
 
Export performance: 
 
§ 
Exports continue to show double-digit 
growth, and were up 17 percent in the 
first nine months compared to the 
same period last year.  
 
§ 
The very strong performance of gold 
exports continues to dominate overall 
export performance. Gold exports are 
now average $50mn per month, or 
roughly double what was the annual 
export figure last fiscal year. 
 
§ 
Besides gold, large export categories 
showing double-digit growth included 
chat, oilseeds and electricity exports. 
 
§ 
Large 
export 
categories 
showing 
declines so far this fiscal year include 
coffee (down 9 percent) and textile 
products (down 23 percent). Exports of 
flowers and pulses are roughly flat from 
their levels of a year ago.

Trade performance… continued: 
 
 
§ 
Ranked by growth rates, the fastest 
increase in exports—besides gold—is 
seen in cereal exports (though from a 
tiny base), electricity exports, chat, 
and oilseeds.  
 
§ 
As has been the case for most of the 
fiscal year, export growth is still not 
broad-based but rather driven by the 
oversized 
impact 
of 
a 
few 
commodities. Excluding gold, exports 
are still showing negative growth of 4 
percent so far in the fiscal year.  
 
§ 
Moreover, some of the underlying 
weakness in overall exports is seen 
from the fact that 11 of the 19 
categories by which export data are 
reported 
are 
showing 
negative 
growth.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
§ 
In a very positive development, industrial 
park exports have for the first time 
exceeded the monthly levels registered 
just before the COVID pandemic. After 
dropping from $16mn in monthly exports 
just before the onset of the pandemic, 
exports fell to a low of just $7mn per 
month in April 2020, but have now fully 
recovered to reach $17mn per month.  
 
§ 
At the current run rate, industrial park 
exports will for the first time exceed 
$200mn on an annual basis.

Trade performance… continued: 
 
§ 
The Hawassa and Bole Lemi 
industrial park continue to 
dominate overall IP exports, 
and their share of the total has 
increased somewhat from 71 to 
74 percent of total IP exports. 
Large improvements in exports 
has been seen in Adama IP.  
 
§ 
Some 
new 
industrial 
parks 
beginning to register export 
activity are Bure Agro Industrial 
Park and Debre Berhan Industrial 
Park. The former has already 
reached $5mn in exports in just a 
few months of operation.  
 
 
§ 
While gold exports averaged 
$50mn per month since the 
start of the fiscal year, the most 
recent quarter has begun to 
show a decline to a level of near 
$30mn to $40mn per month.  
 
§ 
Gold purchase prices by NBE 
continue to trend higher, and 
were roughly 30 percent higher 
from year-ago levels.

Import performance: 
 
§ 
Imports continue to show negative 
growth rates (7 percent decline), as has 
been the case since the start of the year. 
This is a reflection of the significant year-
on-year depreciation, large drops in fuel 
imports earlier in the fiscal year 
(especially during June-Dec 2020), and 
likely some weakness in demand in 
certain economic activities.   
 
§ 
The decline in imports is broad-based and 
is seen in virtually all sub-categories 
except cereal imports (wheat) and the 
“other foods” categories which appears 
to mainly include large cooking oil 
imports. The few other categories 
showing positive import growth include 
fertilizers (which reflect policy decisions 
to boost usage) and textile fabrics (which 
are inputs to industrial parks and 
consistent with rising IP exports). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
§ 
Capital goods imports were also down 
across all main sub-categories, including a 
13 percent drop for industrial capital 
goods. The only exception seen was for 
agricultural capital goods, but these are 
only around 2 percent of total capital 
goods imports.

ETHIOPIA’S SOVEREIGN BOND: Recent developments and outlook 
 
Sovereign Bond Yields: 
 
§ 
Sovereign bond yields remain elevated at 
near 8 percent, or about 2 percentage points 
higher 
than 
their 
level 
before 
the 
announcement of Ethiopia’s plans to seek 
debt relief under the G20 Common 
Framework schemes.  
 
§ 
Ethiopia’s credit rating has now been down-
graded by all three main agencies, with 
Moody’s doings so in May 2021 (from B2 to 
Caa1), following earlier moves by S&P and 
Fitch.  These downgrades reflect—as is their 
purpose—judgements on the likelihood of 
Eurobond repayments and are thus not 
surprising given Government’s intentions to 
seek debt relief under the G20 Common 
Framework. However, the potential inclusion 
of the $1bn Eurobond (3% of external debt) 
in any future debt service relief scheme still 
remains uncertain at this time. 
 
Sovereign Bond Prices 
 
§ 
The price for the sole sovereign bond has 
stayed below its par value since December 
2020, reflecting the higher yield demanded 
by investors anticipating the potential need 
for debt relief to be provided by private 
bondholders. Whether this will actually be 
the case remains unsettled, as the overall 
implementation 
of 
the 
‘Common 
Framework’ is still in its early stages.  
 
Spread vs US Treasuries: 
 
§ 
Reflecting the rising yields on Ethiopia’s 
bonds as well as 10-Year US Treasury rates of 
around 1.6 percent,  the spread vs US 
Treasuries is now in the range of 750-800 
basis points.

EXCHANGE RATE: Recent developments and outlook 
 
§ 
The exchange rate continues to show 
sizeable monthly depreciations, and has 
reached 43.03 Birr/USD as of end-May 
2021 versus 34.16 Birr/USD a year ago.  
 
§ 
The Birr’s depreciation has averaged 77 
cents per month since the start of 2021. 
By contrast, the depreciation averaged 
only 61 cents per month in 2020.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
§ 
Seen in terms of the percentage 
change from year-ago levels, the 
Birr rate depreciation has picked 
up slightly to a range of 26 percent 
in the last three months, versus 
annual depreciation rates of near 
23 percent in the prior three 
months.  
 
§ 
The 
latest 
rate 
of 
annual 
depreciation is still slightly below the 
peak level of 28 percent seen in 
October 2020.

Disclaimer: This report represents solely the views, analysis, and judgement of the Cepheus research team and does not 
necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Fund’s Managing Partners, Advisors, or Investors. 
 
Exchange rate… continued: 
 
§ 
The gap versus the parallel market 
rate moderated slightly in the last two 
months (April, May) versus the first 
quarter of the year, but it still remains 
significant at around 30 percent. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Exchange rate outlook: 
 
§ 
Looking ahead, it appears the central 
bank is comfortable with annual 
depreciation rates of near 23-25 
percent 
(given 
the 
current 
environment of still-elevated inflation 
and its apparent aim of avoiding a real 
appreciation of the currency).  
 
§ 
Since we now expect inflation to 
remain mostly in the mid-teens for the 
rest of 2021, it appears very likely that 
depreciation rates will stay elevated to 
offset what would otherwise be a loss 
in external competitiveness. We thus 
work with the assumption that year-on-
year depreciation rates of 20-25 percent 
will persist for the rest of 2021 followed 
by annualized rates declining to 15 
percent in early 2022. 
 
§ 
On this basis, we project a rate of just 
under 44 Birr/USD by end-June 2021 and 
near 47 Birr/USD by December 2021.
