I am very pleased to disclose to all stakeholders that 2021/22 was another successful fiscal year 
for our Bank, which ranks 30th in The Banker’s rating of top African banks. 
Global developments such as expansion of e-commerce and increased tendency to use digital 
banking favoured our business performance. In addition, local efforts such as demonetization 
of Birr notes and cash holding limits enhanced the circulation of money through banks and the 
public’s use of bank services.  
In contrast, various challenges negatively affected the operation of our service channels and the 
economic activities of both our customers and partners.The disruption of logistics due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic and the inflation arising from the Russia-Ukraine war were among such 
global level factors. At the local level, we faced security issues in some parts of Ethiopia, a wide 
exchange rate gap between the official and parallel markets, high inflation and rapid currency 
depreciation. 
Annual Report 2021/22
1
During the fiscal year, Ethiopia registered a 6.4 % growth in GDP, and the banking and insurance 
sector contributed 3.5% of the GDP. Our stake here was paramount as we lead the banking 
industry, covering over half of the deposit, asset and loans and advances shares in the market. 
Similarly, we contributed USD 2.6 billion (more than 38% of the national foreign currency inflow) 
to the Ethiopian economy. 
Our Bank earned a pre-tax profit of Birr 21.8 billion (41% of what the industry made) in the fiscal 
year, which marks another above-target achievement and a new profit record for us!  
Moreover, we raised our total asset by over 16.8% to Birr 1.16 trillion. Hence we ranked 14th 
among the top African banks in The Banker’s rating and raised our total equity to Birr 71.5 billion 
(including undeclared dividend of Birr 11.9 billion). 
As we managed to mobilize above Birr 155.0 billion deposit and collect Birr 120.6 billion from 
loans, we could disburse a total loan of Birr 179.2 billion and exceed our disbursement target well. 
Remarkably, our IFB business showed a 33.7% increase in deposit mobilization performance and 
a 44% growth in amount of financing. 
We continued to be the most accessible Ethiopian bank by opening 124 new branches across the 
country. We also maintained the largest banking customer base by raising the total number of 
our account holding customers to 35.9 million. 
We increased the number of users of our card banking, mobile banking and mobile money 
services to 7.7 million, 5.9 million, and 5.4 million, respectively. Besides, we raised the number 
of our mobile money service agents and merchants to 20,892 and 37,851.  As a result, digital 
transactions covered a total amount of Birr 1.2 trillion and 35.4% of all transactions mediated by 
our Bank.
2021/22 was a fiscal year marked by considerable efforts for effecting our Bank’s comprehensive 
transformation and reform. Notably, we developed five-year corporate and functional strategies 
and a financial model that would help our Bank to become more competitive and customer-
centered.
 
Like in the previous years, our Bank fulfilled its corporate social responsibilities. We spent nearly 
Birr 1 billion in the fiscal year mainly on supports to other organizations and our country wide 
green initiatives. Our interventions have tremendously assisted in alleviating the social and 
economic problems of the society as the beneficiaries witness it. 
Our Bank has constantly been victorious due to the strategic support of the Board of Directors, 
the coordinated efforts of its executives and employees, the good rapport with its partners, and 
most importantly, the trust of our customers. Deeply grateful for the outstanding contribution of 
all stakeholders, I call for your respective sustained support in making our Bank’s transformation 
agenda, objectives and vision a reality.

CBE SHARIÁ ADVISORY COMMITTEE (SAC) STATEMENT FOR THE
 FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30 2022
Pursuant to the CBE’s SAC charter and its provision associated to IFB service, and in accordance 
with the IFRS & AAOIFI Shariá standard, the SAC presents the following report:
CBE Interest Free Banking (CBE Noor) offers a wide range of deposit, financing and various 
banking and services comparable to other banking services in Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, 
irrespective of race, religion or company. 
We are very glad when we are honored to announce that the interest free banking (CBE Noor) 
has mobilized deposit of birr 69.6 billion and earned profit before tax of birr 1.67 Billion from 
IFB business during the budget year ended June 30 2022. 
Thus, we hope and anticipate that CBE Noor will continue to contribute more by upholding similar 
Shariah compliance dedication, implementations and applications without undermining the 
never-ending quest of customers and by addressing banking the unbanked, serving the missing 
middle and accommodating all those who are far from banks due to their uncompromised 
belief. 
As Shariah Advisory Committee of the Bank, we have given our highest dedication to ensure 
best quality and demonstrated commitment to Shariah compliance in the products, process, 
documentations, marketing and other related Sharia compliant products and services by the 
Bank during the fiscal year. Besides its advisory and Shariá compliance assurance services on 
the regular banking businesses, the Shariah Committee also supports on the development of 
other Shariah based products and services initiated and attend awareness creation programs 
to address questions may be raised by the Community at large. 
We have reviewed the principles and the contracts relating to the transactions and applications 
introduced by CBE Noor during the year ended 30 June 2022.  We have also conducted our 
reviews to form an opinion as to whether the Bank has complied with Shariá Rules and Principles 
and also with the specific Fatwas, rulings and guidelines issued by us and the Bank. 
Annual Report 2021/22
3
The Bank’s management is responsible for ensuring that the bank conducts its business in 
accordance with Shariá Rules and Principles. It is our responsibility to form an independent 
opinion, based on our review of the operations of the Bank, and to report. 
We planned and performed our review so as to obtain all the information and explanations 
which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the Bank has not violated Shariá Rules and Principles. 
In our opinion:
a.  The contracts, transactions and dealings entered into by the Bank during the year ended 
      30 June 2022 that we have reviewed are in compliance with the Shari’a Rules and 
      Principles;
 b. The profits distribution and loss allocation to the investment accounts complies with the 
     principle adopted according to the Sharia rules and principles. 
c.  All amounts devolved to the Bank from sources or realized from sources like penalties 
        or by means that do not comply with the Sharia rules and principles were not  incorporated 
     in the Bank’s revenues and are placed and reported separately for charity purposes. 
d.  The Responsibility of paying Zakat falls on Investment account holders. The Bank is not 
     authorized to pay Zakat directly, as there is no law to that effect. 
Finally, the Sharia Advisory Committee takes this opportunity to express its thanks to the 
Board of Directors and the Bank’s management for their co-operation and their keenness in 
understanding and adherence to the rules of the noble Shariá principles.

1  HIGHLIGHTS OF GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC ECONOMIES
1.1 The Global Economy
1.2  The Ethiopian Economy
The recovery of the global economy that started 
in the first half of 2021 was hampered by the 
resurgence of the COVID-19 Omicron variant in 
the fourth quarter of 2021 and the Russia-Ukraine 
war in the first quarter of 2022. Multiple shocks, 
among which is the Russia-Ukraine war, persistent 
inflation, tighter financial conditions, and lingering 
supply constraints impacted global economic 
activity. According to World Bank (June 2022)1, 
global economic growth was estimated to fall from 
5.7% in 2021 to 2.9% in 2022, which is the weakest 
growth since 2001 except for the years that saw the 
global financial crisis.
Global trade was slow owing to the lingering 
effects of the Coronavirus pandemic and disrupted 
global value chains due to the war in Ukraine. The 
services trade has regained its pre-pandemic level, 
driven by a rebound in non-tourism services. The 
tourism sector started to recover in 2021 from the 
COVID-19 impact as countries eased restrictions. 
International tourism continued to recover at a 
strong pace in the first quarter of 2022, though 
it remained 61% below its 2019 levels in the first 
quarter of 2022. 2
Global foreign direct investment (FDI) flow grew 
by 64% in 2021 from the level in 2020 (during the 
first year of the COVID-19 pandemic). However, with 
the war in Ukraine, investor uncertainty and risk 
aversion could put significant downward pressure 
on global FDI in 2022 (UNCTAD, June 2022).3
Global unemployment is expected to remain above 
the pre-COVID-19 level (ILO, January 2022).4 The 
global labor force participation rate in 2022 is 
projected to remain at 1.2% below that of 2019. On 
the other hand, remittance inflow to low and middle 
income countries increased by 10.2 % in 2021 and 
is estimated to moderately grow by 4.9 % in 2022 
(World Bank, Nov 2022). 5
During 2021/22, the average price of energy and 
non-energy items increased by 89.5% and 24.9% 
respectively. The strong increase in commodity 
prices had large implications for the Ethiopian 
economy and that of the CBE.
The Ethiopian economy grew by 6.4% during the 
2021/22 FY despite the impacts of the conflict in 
the northern part of the country, the COVID-19 
pandemic, drought, an external price shock, and a 
slowdown in external finance.
Exports remained buoyant during the 2021/22 FY, 
in which export earnings exceeded USD 4 billion, 
with a 14.2% increase from the previous fiscal year. 
Likewise, goods imports showed a 26.6% increase. 
Ethiopia earned USD 2.8 billion during the FY from 
private transfers, which showed a slight decline 
from the earnings in the preceding year. The current 
account deficits widened during the year, while the 
overall balance of payments registered a deficit in 
contrast to the surplus in the preceding year.
Inflation continued to rise during the year under 
review, 
with 
general 
year-on-year 
inflation 
reaching 34% in June 2022. While the year-on-year 
food inflation reached 38.1%, the non-food inflation 
was 28.4%, with some possible adverse impacts on 
banks’ mobilization of deposits from the household 
sector of the economy.
The financial sector became robust as eleven 
newly joining banks increased the competition in 
the banking industry. The government continued 
to implement its reform programs during the FY. 
On the other hand, the National Bank of Ethiopia 
issued various directives, notably on foreign 
currency retention, utilization, and intermediation; 
revising the reserve requirements of banks, and 
investing in Development Bank of Ethiopia bonds.

The total asset of CBE reached Birr 1.16 trillion as of 30 June 2022, growing by 16.8% from the

asset growth. During the 2021/22 FY, the loan portfolio increased by 19.1% to Birr 990.7 billion. CBE 
NOOR financing grew by 44.2% from the preceding year, which indicates the bank’s commitment to

Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (the Bank) 
and its consolidated subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated and the Bank’s 
statements of ﬁnancial position as at 30 June 2022, and the consolidated and the Bank’s statements 
of proﬁt or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated and Bank’s statements of changes in 
equity and consolidated and the Bank’s statements of cash ﬂows for the year then ended, and notes 
to the consolidated and the Bank’s ﬁnancial statements, including consolidated and the Bank’s 
summaries of signiﬁcant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated ﬁnancial statements present fairly, in all material 
respects, the consolidated ﬁnancial positions of the Group and of the Bank as at 30 June 2022 and 
the consolidated and the Bank’s ﬁnancial performances and the consolidated and the Bank’s cash 
ﬂows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs).
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs).   Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.   We are independent of the Group in 
accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements in Ethiopia, and we have fulﬁlled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with those requirements and the IESBA Code.   We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA - (Continued)
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signiﬁcance 
in our audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the current period.   These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
Group and Consolidation
 
The scope of our Group audit was determined by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its 
environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at 
the Group level.   Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope on the audit work 
at all companies operating within the Group.
Our audit work was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were 
lower than Group materiality.   At the Bank level we also tested the consolidation process and 
carried out analytical procedures.
Loans and Advances
There are risks that loans and advances may be given without proper managerial approval; may not 
be accurately recorded; do not exist; may not be recorded at appropriate values; and all bad and 
doubtful balances may not have been provided for written off. In our response to these risks, we 
have assessed the reasonableness of the design of the system of internal control by enquiring of 
the relevant Bank personnel and reviewing the documented system developed by the Bank. We 
tested this system in order to conﬁrm our understanding of it. We identiﬁed the preventive and 
detective controls. We checked a sample of selected transactions covering the whole year to see 
that all controls were exercised on all transactions. For a sample of disbursements made during 
the year, we checked the approval of appropriate level of management and checked that all 
formalities necessary before disbursement of loans and advances had been fulﬁlled. We test 
checked loan agreements and legal documents to verify the terms and conditions of loans and 
advances. We obtained an analysis of loans and veriﬁed that they had been classiﬁed in correct 
categories and we considered the value of collateral available against each loan for calculating the 
provision for doubtful loans and advances. Our testing did not identify major weakness in the 
design and operation of controls that would have required us to expand the nature or scope of our 
planned detailed test work. Overall, we found no major concerns in respect to the completion of 
formalities or the recording of loans and advances at appropriate values.
                 
Responsibilities of the Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to 
enable the preparation of ﬁnancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
Annual Report 2021/22
15
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE SUPERVISING AUTHORITY OF 
COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA - (Continued)
Responsibilities of the Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial 
Statements - (Continued)
In preparing the ﬁnancial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate 
the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s ﬁnancial reporting 
process.
Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an audi-
tor’s report that includes our opinion.   Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists.   Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these ﬁnancial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISA, we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the audit.   We also:
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁnancial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and 
obtain audit evidence that is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion The 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast signiﬁcant doubt on the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the ﬁnancial 
statements or if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE SUPERVISING AUTHORITY OF

Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements - (Continued)
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with 
relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current 
period and are therefore the key audit matters.   We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our 
report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh 
the public interest benefits of such communication.
The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Woizero 
Banchiayehu Tamirat.
Date 27 April 2023
 
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY
The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements of Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (“The Group”), comprising the consolidated

for the year then ended and the notes to the ﬁnancial statements , which include a summary of 
signiﬁcant accounting policies and other explanatory notes, in accordance with International

To enable the Directors to meet those responsibilities, the Board of Directors (the "Board") and 
management sets standards and management implements systems of internal control, 
accounting and information systems aimed at providing reasonable assurance that assets are

responsibilities and authorities within a clearly deﬁned framework, effective accounting 
procedures and adequate segregation of duties.

(1)  REPORTING ENTITY
Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (the Bank) is a financial institution established in 1942 as State Bank 
of Ethiopia and later incorporated as a limited liability public enterprise pursuant to the laws of the 
Governement of Ethiopia on December 16, 1963 for an indefinite time period as a holding Bank. 
The Bank’s registered office is in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and it has 1,831branches.
(2)  BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The Bank has subsidiaries in Ethiopia, the Republic of Djibouti and the Republic of South Sudan. The 
consolidated financial statement incorporates the financial statements of the Bank and four entities 
controlled by the Bank- its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group or individually as Group 
entities). Control is achieved where the Bank has the power to govern the financial and operation 
policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
(3)  BASIS OF PREPARATION
(a) Statement of Compliance
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(“IASB”).
(b)  Basis of Measurement
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the following 
significant items:
1. Equity instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income; 
2. Non-current assets held for sale measured at lower of their carrying amounts and fair value 
    less costs to sell; and
3. The liability for defined benefit obligations is recognized as the present value of the defined 
    obligation, plus unrecognized actuarial gains less unrecognized past service cost and 
    unrecognized actuarial losses.
(c)  Use of Judgments and Estimates
In preparing these financial statements, management has made judgments, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts 
of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are 
recognized prospectively.
Judgments 
Information about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant 
effects on the amounts recognized in the financial statements included in the following note: 
Note 4 (a) – determination of control over investees. 
Management used the control model under IFRS 10, to determine whether the control indicators

Note 4(t) – recognition of deferred taxes.
Note 4(c) vii) Fair value measurement of financial instruments
Information on assumptions and uncertainty of estimates posing a significant risk of resulting in a 
material adjustment is presented as follows:
d)  Classification and Impairment of Financial Assets
The classification of financial assets includes the assessment of the business model within which the 
assets are held and assessment of whether the contractual terms of the financial asset are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
The impairment of financial instruments includes the assessment of whether credit risk on the 
financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and incorporation of forward-looking 
information in the measurement of expected credit losses (ECL). 
The measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised 
cost and FVOCI is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about 
future economic conditions and credit behaviour (e.g. the likelihood of customers defaulting and the 
resulting losses). Explanation of the inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used in measuring 
ECL is further detailed in note 4(c)(viii) which also sets out key sensitivities of the ECL to changes in 
these elements. 
A number of significant judgements are also required in applying the accounting requirements for 
measuring ECL, such as: 
• Determining criteria for significant increase in credit risk; 
• Choosing appropriate models and assumptions for the measurement of ECL; 
• Establishing the number and relative weightings of forward-looking scenarios for each type of 
    product/market and the associated ECL; and 
• Establishing groups of similar financial assets for the purposes of measuring ECL. 
Detailed information about the judgements and estimates made by the Group in the above areas is 
set out in Note 4(c)(viii).
e)  Deferred Tax
The Group is subject to income tax under different jurisdictions. Estimates are made through a tax 
projection for determining the provision for income taxes and liabilities. When the final tax outcome is 
different from the amounts that were recorded, differences will impact the provision for income taxes 
and deferred taxes in the period in which such determination is made (see note 4(t).

(4)  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in this 
financial statement.  
(a)  Details of Consolidation
i.  Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are investees controlled by the Bank. The Bank controls a subsidiary if it is exposed to, 
or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over the investee. The Bank reassesses whether it has control if there 
are changes to one or more of the elements of control. The financial statements s of subsidiaries, 
as described below, and are included in the financial statements s from the date on which control 
commences until the date when control ceases.
The Bank’s subsidiaries are as follows:

ii. Associates
Associates are all entities over which the Bank has significant influence but no control, generally 
accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates 
are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the investments 
are initially recognized at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize the 
investor’s share of profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. 
If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a 
proportionate share of the amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) is 
reclassified to profit or loss as appropriate.
The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognized in profit or loss. 
When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equal or exceeds its interest in the associate, including 
other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred legal 
or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Bank and its 
associate are recognized in the Bank’s financial statements only to the extent of unrelated parties’ 
interests in the associates. 
iii. Transactions Eliminated on Consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-
group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized gains 
arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to 
the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee.  Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as 
unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

(b)  Foreign Currency
(i)  Foreign Currency Transactions
 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group’s 
entities at the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated 
into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss 
on monetary items is the difference between the amortized cost in the functional currency at the 
beginning of the year, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the year, and the amortized 
cost in the foreign currency translated at the spot exchange rate at the end of the year.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated 
into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate at the date on which the fair value is determined. 
Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated 
using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
This consolidated financial statement is presented in Ethiopian Birr (“ETB”), which is the Group's 
functional currency. The loans granted and liabilities contracted are in Ethiopian Birr, which is the 
currency that predominates in the economic environment where the Group operates. Similarly, the 
main cash flows for settled goods and services, taxes and other obligations are in Birr.
For entities incorporated in Ethiopia the legal currency is the Ethiopian Birr; whereas for the entities 
incorporated in the Republic of South Sudan the legal currency is the South Sudanese pound while 
Djibouti Franc is the legal currency in the Republic of Djibouti.
(ii)  Foreign Operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, 
are translated into Ethiopian Birr (ETB) at the spot exchange rates at the reporting date. The income 
and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Ethiopian Birr (ETB) using an average rate for 
the period.
Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI), and accumulated 
in the foreign currency translation reserve.
(c)  Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
(i)  Recognition and Initial Measurement
The Group initially recognises loans and advances, deposits and debt securities on the date at which 
they are originated. All other financial assets and liabilities (including assets designated at fair value 
through profit or loss) are initially recognised on the trade date on which the Group becomes a party to 
the contractual provision of the instrument.
A financial asset or liability is initially measured at fair value plus (for an item not subsequently 
measured at fair value through profit or loss) transaction costs that are directly attributable to its 
acquisition or issue. Subsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities (deposits and debt securities) 
are measured at their amortized cost using the effective interest method.

(ii)  Classification and Measurement
Classification and Measurement of Financial Assets
On initial recognition, financial assets are classified into one of the following measurement categories:
•  Amortised cost;
•  Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI);
•  Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL);
•  Elected at fair value through other comprehensive income (equities only); or
•  Designated at FVTPL.
Financial assets include both debt and equity instruments.
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not 
designated as at FVTPL:
•  The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual 
     cash flows; and
• The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
    solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not 
designated as at FVTPL:
• The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting 
    contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
• The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
    solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably 
elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-
investment basis.
All other financial assets are classified as measured at FVTPL.
In addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise 
meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates 
or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. 
Debt instruments, including loans and debt securities, are classified into one of the following 
measurement categories:
• Amortised cost;
• Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI);
• Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL); or
• Designated at FVTPL
Classification of debt instruments is determined based on:
(i) The business model under which the asset is held; and
(ii) The contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument.

Business Model Assessment
Business model assessment involves determining how financial assets are managed in order to 
generate cash flows. The Group’s business model assessment is based on the following categories:
• Held to collect: The objective of the business model is to hold assets and collect contractual 
   cash flows. Any sales of the asset are incidental to the objective of the model.
• Held to collect and for sale: Both collecting contractual cash flows and sales are integral to 
    achieving the objectives of the business model.
• Other business model: The business model is neither held-to-collect nor held-to-collect and for 
    sale.
The Group makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a 
portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided 
to management. The information considered includes:
• The stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in 
   practice.In particular, whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest 
   revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial 
   assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows 
   through the sale of the assets;
• How the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group’s management;
• The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held 
    within that business model) and how those risks are managed;
• How managers of the business are compensated – e.g. whether compensation is based on the 
   fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and
• The frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its 
     expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered 
    in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Group’s stated objective for managing 
    the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.
Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair 
value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor 
held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.
Assessment whether Contractual Cash Flows Is Solely Payments of Principal and Interest
The contractual cash flow characteristics assessment involves assessing the contractual features of 
an instrument to determine if they give rise to cash flows that are consistent with a basic lending 
arrangement. Contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement if they represent 
cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI).
For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on 
initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit 
risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other 
basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as profit margin.
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the 
Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial

Assessment whether Contractual Cash Flows Is Solely Payments of Principal and Interest - (Continued)
asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows 
such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Group considers:
•  Contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;
•  Leverage features;
•  Prepayment and extension terms;
•  Terms that limit the Group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse asset 
    arrangements); and
•  Features that modify consideration of the time value of money – e.g. periodical reset of interest 
    rates.
The Group holds a portfolio of long-term fixed rate loans for which the Bank has the option to propose 
to revise the interest rate at periodic reset dates. These reset rights are limited to the market rate at 
the time of revision. The borrowers have an option to either accept the revised rate or redeem the loan 
at par without penalty. The Group has determined that the contractual cash flows of these loans are 
solely payments of principal and interest because the option varies the interest rate in a way that is 
consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and costs associated 
with the principal amount outstanding.
Debt instruments measured at amortized cost
Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost if they are held within a business model whose 
objective is to hold for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely 
payments of principal and interest. After initial measurement, debt instruments in this category are 
carried at amortized cost. Interest income on these instruments is recognized in interest income using 
the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future 
cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the gross carrying amount 
of a financial asset. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on 
acquisition, transaction costs and fees that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.
Impairment on debt instruments measured at amortized cost is calculated using the expected credit 
loss approach. Loans and debt securities measured at amortized cost are presented net of the allowance 
for credit losses (ACL) in the statement of financial position.
Debt instruments measured at FVOCI
Debt instruments are measured at FVOCI if they are held within a business model whose objective 
is to hold for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling financial assets, where the assets’ 
cash flows represent payments that are solely payments of principal and interest. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, unrealized gains and losses on debt instruments measured at FVOCI are recorded in other 
comprehensive income (OCI), unless the instrument is designated in a fair value hedge relationship. 
When designated in a fair value hedge relationship, any changes in fair value due to changes in the 
hedged risk are recognized in Non-interest income in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other 
Comprehensive Income. Upon derecognition, realized gains and losses are reclassified from OCI and 
recorded in Non-interest income in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income 
on an average cost basis.

Debt instruments measured at FVOCI - (Continued)
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to the amortized cost of the debt instrument are 
recognized in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.
Premiums, discounts and related transaction costs are amortized over the expected life of the 
instrument to Interest income in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income 
using the effective interest rate method.
Impairment on debt instruments measured at FVOCI is calculated using the expected credit loss 
approach. The ACL on debt instruments measured at FVOCI does not reduce the carrying amount of the 
asset in the Statement of Financial Position, which remains at its fair value. Instead, an amount equal 
to the allowance that would arise if the assets were measured at amortised cost is recognised in OCI 
with a corresponding charge to Provision for credit losses in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other 
Comprehensive Income. The accumulated allowance recognised in OCI is recycled to the Statement of 
Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income upon derecognition of the debt instrument.
Debt instruments measured at FVTPL
Debt instruments are measured at FVTPL if assets:
i)    Are held for trading purposes;
ii)   Are held as part of a portfolio managed on a fair value basis; or
iii)  Whose cash flows do not represent payments that are solely payments of principal and interest.
These instruments are measured at fair value in the Statement of Financial Position, with transaction 
costs recognized immediately in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income as 
part of Non-interest income. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized as part of Non-
interest income in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.
Debt instruments designated at FVTPL
Financial assets classified in this category are those that have been designated by the Group upon 
initial recognition, and once designated, the designation is irrevocable. The FVTPL designation is 
available only for those financial assets for which a reliable estimate of fair value can be obtained.
Financial assets are designated at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting 
mismatch which would otherwise arise.
Financial assets designated at FVTPL are recorded in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value. 
Changes in fair value are recognized in Non-interest income in the Statement of Profit or Loss and 
Other Comprehensive Income.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments are classified into one of the following measurement categories:
• Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL); or
• Elected at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

Assessment whether Contractual Cash Flows Is Solely Payments of Principal and Interest - (Continued)
Equity instruments measured at FVTPL
Equity instruments are measured at FVTPL, unless an election is made to designate them at FVOCI 
upon purchase, with transaction costs recognized immediately in the Statement of profit or loss and 
other comprhensive income as part of Non-interest income. Subsequent to initial recognition the 
changes in fair value are recognized as part of Non-interest income in the Statement of Profit or Loss 
and Other Comprehensive Income.
Equity instruments measured at FVOCI
At initial recognition, there is an irrevocable option for the Group to classify non-trading equity 
instruments at FVOCI. This election is used for certain equity investments for strategic or longer-term 
investment purposes. This election is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is not available 
to equity instruments that are held for trading purposes.
Gains and losses on these instruments including when derecognized/sold are recorded in OCI and are 
not subsequently reclassified to the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.  As 
such, there is no specific impairment requirement. Dividends received are recorded in Interest income 
in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. Any transaction costs incurred 
upon purchase of the security are added to the cost basis of the security and are not reclassified to the 
Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income on sale of the security.
Reclassifications
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after 
the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets.
Classification and Measurement of Financial Liabilities
The Group classifies its financial liabilities, other than financial guarantees and loan commitments, as 
measured at amortised cost.
(iii)  Derecognition
Financial Assets
The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the 
financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in 
which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or 
in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership 
and it does not retain control of the financial asset.
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the 
carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognized) and the sum of (i) the consideration 
received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain 
or loss that had been recognized in OCI is recognized in profit or loss.

(c) Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - (Continued)
(iii) Derecognition - (Continued)
Financial Assets - (Continued)
Any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at 
FVOCI is not recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities. Any interest in transferred 
financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as 
a separate asset or liability.
In transactions in which the Group neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and 
rewards of ownership of a financial asset and it retains control over the asset, the Group continues to 
recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is 
exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset. 
Financial Liabilities
The Group derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or 
cancelled, or expire.
(iv)  Modifications of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
Financial Assets
If the terms of a financial asset are modified, the Group evaluates whether the cash flows of the 
modified asset are substantially different. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the 
contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this 
case, the original financial asset is derecognized and a new financial asset is recognized at fair value.
If the terms of a financial asset were modified because of financial difficulties of the borrower and the 
asset was not derecognized, then impairment of the asset was measured using the pre-modification 
interest rate.
Financial Liabilities
The Group derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the 
modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified 
terms is recognized at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability 
extinguished and the new financial liability with modified terms is recognized in profit or loss.
(v)  Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statement of financial 
position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intents either to 
settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS, or for gains and 
losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Group’s trading activity.

(c) Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - (Continued)
(vi)  Amortized Cost Measurement
The ‘amortized cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset 
or financial liability is measured at initial recognition, minus principal repayments, plus or minus 
the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between the initial 
amount recognized and the maturity amount, minus any reduction for impairment.
(vii)  Fair Value Measurement 
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, 
the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability 
reflects its non-performance risk. 
When available, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active 
market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take 
place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Group uses valuation techniques that maximize 
the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen 
valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in 
pricing a transaction.
There is no active market or observable prices except for foreign currency market to measure the 
Group’s financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value.  Fair value of financial assets and financial 
liabilities is determined at each reporting date for disclosure in the financial statement purposes only.
(viii)  Impairment 
The Group recognises loss allowances for ECL on the following financial instruments that are not 
measured at FVTPL:
•  Financial assets that are debt instruments;
•  Lease receivables;
•  Financial guarantee contracts issued; and
•  Loan commitments issued.
No impairment loss is recognised on equity investments.
The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except for the following, for 
which they are measured as 12-month ECL:
•  Debt investment securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and
•  Other financial instruments (other than lease receivables) on which credit risk has not increased 
    significantly since their initial recognition (see Note 3(a)).
	
Loss allowances for lease receivables are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.The 
Group considers a debt security to have low credit risk when their credit risk rating is equivalent to the 
globally understood definition of ‘investment grade’.

(viii)  Impairment - (Continued)
12-month ECLs are the portion of ECL that results from default events on a financial instrument that 
are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.
Measurement of ECL
ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. They are measured as follows:
• Financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash 
   shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the 
   contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive);
• Financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the difference between the 
   gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows;
• Undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash 
    flows that are due to the Group if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the 
    Group expects to receive; and
• Financial guarantee contracts: the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts 
    that the Group expects to recover.    See also Note 4(a).
Restructured Financial Assets
If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced 
with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made of whether the 
financial asset should be derecognised (see note 4(c)(viii)) and ECL are measured as follows.
• If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, and then the 
    expected cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash 
    shortfalls from the existing asset.
• If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected 
   fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the 
   time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the 
    existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting 
   date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset.
Credit-impaired Financial Assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and 
debt financial assets carried at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when 
one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial 
asset have occurred.
Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:
• significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
• a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
• the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider 
   otherwise;
• it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
• In existence of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

(viii)  Impairment - (Continued)
Credit-impaired Financial Assets - (Continued)
A loan that has been renegotiated due to deterioration in the borrower’s condition is usually considered 
to be credit-impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has 
reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is 
overdue for 90 days or more is considered impaired.
In making an assessment of whether an investment in sovereign debt is credit-impaired, the Group 
considers the following factors:
• The rating agencies’ assessments of creditworthiness;
• The country’s ability to access the capital markets for new debt issuance;
• The probability of debt being restructured, resulting in holders suffering losses through voluntary 
    or mandatory debt forgiveness; and
• The international support mechanisms in place to provide the necessary support as ‘lender of 
last resort’ to that country, as well as the intention, reflected in public statements, of governments and 
agencies to use those mechanisms. This includes an assessment of the depth of those mechanisms 
and, irrespective of the political intent, whether there is the capacity to fulfil the required criteria.
Presentation of Allowance for ECL in the Statement of Financial Position
Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the statement of financial position as follows:
• Financial assets measured at amortised cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of 
    the assets;
• Loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts: generally, as a provision;
• Where a financial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Group 
   cannot identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from those on the drawn 
   component: The Group presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The combined 
   amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any 
   excess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a 
   provision; and
• Debt instruments measured at FVOCI: No loss allowance is recognised in the statement of financial 
    position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance 
   is disclosed and is recognised in the fair value reserve.
Write-off
Loans and debt securities are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of 
recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the borrower does not have assets 
or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the 
write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in 
order to comply with the Bank’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.   
(d)  Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash comprise cash on hand, placements with other banks, cash reserve with the National Bank of 
Ethiopia, payment and settlement account with the National Bank of Ethiopia and Cash in Transit.  Cash 
equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of 
cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in values.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
(4) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (Continued)
(d)  Cash and Cash Equivalents - (Continued)
Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost in the statement of financial position 
(e)  Loans and Advances
Loans and advances are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are 
not quoted in an active market and that the Group does not intend to sell immediately or in the near 
term. 
(f)  Debt Securities
Government securities and coupons and corporate bonds are non-derivative financial assets with fixed 
or determinable payments and fixed maturity that the Group has the positive intent and ability to hold 
to maturity, and which are not designated as at fair value through profit or loss. They are measured at 
amortized cost-plus accrued interest.
(g)  Property, Plant and Equipment
(i) Recognition and Measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, which includes capitalized borrowing 
costs, less accumulated depreciation and cumulative impairment losses. 
Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalized as part 
of that equipment.
If significant parts of an item of property or equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted 
for as separate items (major components) of property and equipment.
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the 
proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognized 
net within operating and administrative expenses in profit or loss.
(ii)  Subsequent Costs
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it is probable that the future economic benefits of the 
expenditure will flow to the Group. Minor ongoing repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
(iii)  Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property and equipment less their estimated 
residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and is generally 
recognized in profit or loss. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their 
useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease 
term. Land is not depreciated. 
Depreciation is charged on the straight –line basis at the following rates per annum.  
                                                                               %

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end and 
adjusted if appropriate.
Minor repairs and maintenance costs are expense as incurred.

(h)  Leases
(i)  Group Acting as a Lessee
The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset at cost and a lease liability at the present value of the lease 
payments that are not paid at that date. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate 
implicit in the lease; if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group used the lessee’s incremental 
borrowing rate.
After the commencement date, the Group measures the right-of-use asset applying a cost model (cost 
less any cumulative depreciation and any cumulative impairment). In the case of the lease liability, the 
Group measure it by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the 
carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made, and re-measuring the carrying amount to reflect 
any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The 
Group exempt to apply the requirement for short term leases and leases for which the underlying 
asset is of low value.
(ii)  Bank Acting as a Lessor – Finance Leases 
Where the Group is the lessor, the Group classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a 
finance lease.
Finance Lease
With a lease agreement that transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership 
of the asset to the lessee, then the arrangement is classified as a finance lease and a receivable equal 
to the net investment in the lease is recognized and presented within receivable.
The Group recognizes assets held under a finance lease in its statement of financial position and 
present them as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. After the initial 
measurement, the Group recognizes finance income over the lease term, based on a pattern reflecting 
a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease.
Operating Lease
A lease agreement that does not transfer substantially the entire risks and rewards incidental to the 
ownership of the asset to the lease is classified as an operating lease.
The Group recognizes lease payments from operating leases as income on either a straight-line 
basis or another systematic basis. The Group applies another systematic basis if that basis is more 
representative of the pattern in which benefit from the use of the underlying asset is diminished.
(i)  Investment Property
Investment property is property held either to earn rental income, capital appreciation, or both, and is 
not intended to be sold in the normal course of business. All investment properties are recognized at 
cost less accumulated depreciation and cumulative impairment losses. 
When the use of a property changes such that it is reclassified as property plant and equipment, its 
carrying value at the date of reclassification becomes its cost for subsequent accounting.

COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
(4) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (Continued)
(j)  Non-current Assets Held for Sale 
Non-Current assets held for sale correspond to acquired assets such as real estate and moveable 
property foreclosed in the absence of repayment of loans due to the Group. This type of non-current 
available-for-sale assets are expected to be recovered mainly through sale and not through continued 
use.
The value of these assets is updated through an internal appraisal made within three months of the 
date on which the Group acquires ownership; therefore, if the appraisal value is less than carrying 
value, a valuation reserve is created and charged to the year’s income. 
Subsequently, the available-for-sale assets or group of assets are recorded at the lower of their carrying 
amount and the fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses in the initial classification of available-
for-sale assets and subsequent gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss. 
If the sale is paid up-front and the amount recovered exceeds the carrying amount, the difference 
is directly recorded in the year’s income. If it is a sale to be paid in installments, and the amount to 
be recovered exceeds the carrying amount, the difference is accounted for as deferred income, and 
accrued as installments are collected. If the recovered amount is less than the carrying amount, the 
loss is charged to income, irrespective of the sale is paid up-front or in installments. 
(k)  Intangible Assets 
Software
Software acquired by the Group is measured at cost less accumulated amortization and any impairment 
losses. 
Subsequent expenditure on software assets is capitalized only when it increases the future economic 
benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
 
Software is amortized on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over its estimated useful life, from 
the date on which it is available for use. The estimated useful life of software for the current and 
comparative periods is four years. 
Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and 
adjusted as found appropriate.
(l)  Impairment of Non-financial Assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (other than 
deferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication 
exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates 
cash inflows from continuing use that is largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or 
Cash Generating Unit CGUs.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs 
to sell. ‘Value in use’ is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset or CGU.
Commercial Bank of Ethiopia
40
COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
(4) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (Continued)
(l)  Impairment of Non-financial Assets - (Continued)
An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable 
amount.
The Group’s corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are used by more than one 
CGU. Corporate assets are allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for 
impairment as part of the testing of the CGUs to which the corporate assets are allocated.
Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other 
assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is 
reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been 
recognized. 
(m)  Deposits from Banks and Customers
Deposits and borrowings are the Group’s sources of debt funding. These liabilities are initially 
measured at fair value minus incremental direct transaction costs, and subsequently measured at 
their amortized cost using the effective interest method.
(n)  Provisions
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation.
(o)  Employee Benefits
i.  Defined Benefit Plans
A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan at the termination of the employment 
relationship, other than a defined contribution plan. The Group accounts not only its legal obligation 
under the formal term described above, also for any constructive obligation that arises from the Group 
´s customary practices. A customary practice gives rise to a constructive obligation where the Group 
has no realistic alternatives but to pay employee benefits.
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated by estimating the amount of 
future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; 
that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and any unrecognized past service costs 
are deducted.  The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on governmental bonds that have 
maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the 
same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.  
The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. 
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service 
by employees is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the average period until the 
benefits become vested.

(o)  Employee Benefits - (Continued)
i.  Defined Benefit Plans- (Continued)
To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognized immediately in profit or 
loss.
The Group recognizes all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other 
comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
ii. Short-term Benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed 
as the related services are provided, current wages including medical expenses, being taken into 
consideration.
A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid and includes mainly wages and salaries, 
bonuses, leave benefits and other allowances, and incentives as a result of past services provided by 
the employees, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
iii. Termination Benefits
According to Law, in case of unjustified dismissal, employers are obligated to pay to their employees 
compensation based on the years of service.
(p)  Legal Reserve
The legal reserve is a statutory reserve required by the regulators. The Bank has to transfer annually 
25% of its annual net profit as a legal reserveuntil such reserve equals its capital. When the legal 
reserve equals the capital of the Bank, the amount to be transferred to the legal reserve shall be 10% 
of the annual net profit. For Commercial Nominees PLC and Bole Printinting Enterprise PLC 5% of 
the net profit until the accumulated legal reserve balance amounts to 10% of the issued share capital 
according to commercial code of Ethiopia Article 454.  
(q)  Revenue and Expense Recognition
Interest income and expense are recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest method. 
The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts 
through the expected life of the financial instrument to:
•  The gross carrying amount of the financial assets; or
•  The amortized cost of the financial liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments other than credit-impaired assets, 
the Bank estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, 
but not future credit losses. For credit-impaired financial assets, a credit adjusted effective interest 
rate is calculating using estimated future cash flows including incurred credit losses.
The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transactions costs, fees and points paid or 
received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental 
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability.

(q)  Revenue and Expense Recognition - (Continued)
Gross Carrying Amount
The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortized cost of a financial asset before adjusting 
for any expected credit loss allowance.
Calculation of Interest Income and Expenses
In calculating interest income and expenses, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying 
amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortized cost of the liability.
However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the financial 
asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the 
gross basis.
For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest income is calculated by 
applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the asset. The calculation of 
interest income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves.
Presentation of Interest Income and Expenses
Interest income and expense presented in the statement of profit or loss and OCI include:
• Interest on financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost calculated on an 
    effective interest basis;
• Interest on debt instruments measured at FVOCI calculated on an effective interest basis;
• The effective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivatives designated in cash flow 
    hedges of variability in interest cash flows, in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect 
    interest income/expense; and
• The effective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivatives designated in fair value 
    hedges of interest rate risk.
Interest income and expense on all trading assets and liabilities are considered to be incidental to the 
Bank’s trading operations and are presented together with all other changes in the fair value of trading 
assets and liabilities in net trading income. 
Interest income and expense on other financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL are presented 
in net income from other financial instruments at FVTPL
(r)  Fees and Commissions
Fees and commission income and expense that are integral to the effective interest rate on a financial 
asset or financial liability are included in the measurement of the effective interest rate. 
Other fees and commission income relate mainly to commissions on local money transfers (LMTS), 
guarantee commission, outward remittance, card charges, and commission on import letter of credit– 
are recognized as the related services are performed.
Other fees and commission expense relate mainly to transaction and service fees, which are expensed 
as the services are received.

(s)  Dividend Income
Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive income is established. Dividends are presented 
in net trading income, net income from other financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss 
or other revenue based on the underlying classification of the equity investment.
(t)  Income Tax
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognized in profit or loss except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity or in OCI.  
Current Tax
The current income tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment 
to the tax payable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable is the best estimate 
of tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects the uncertainty related to income taxes, if 
any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date.  
Deferred Tax
Deferred tax is measured under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between such 
values. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to 
temporary differences when recovered or settled in each of the jurisdictions where the subsidiaries of 
the Bank operate, based on laws enacted or substantially enacted as of the reporting date.
No deferred taxes are recognized for the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that 
is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable income. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 
assets and liabilities, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and to the same 
fiscal entity or on different tax entities, but the intent is to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a 
net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary 
differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
such can be reversed. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.
(u)  Contingencies
Liabilities for loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred 
and the amount thereof can be reasonably estimated.  When a reasonable estimation cannot be 
made, disclosure is provided in the NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Contingent 
revenues, earnings or assets are not recognized until realization is assured.

(v)  New Standards, Amendments and Interpretations
A number of new standards, amendments to standard and interpretations are not yet effective for the 
period ended 30 June 2022 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. These 
are summarized as follows: 
IFRS 17 is not applicable to the business of the Bank and will therefore have no impact on future 
financial statements. The directors are of the opinion that the impact of the application of the 
remaining Standards and Interpretations will be as follows:
Onerous Contracts: Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37)
Amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board, clarify that the 'costs of fulfilling a contract' when 
assessing whether a contract is onerous comprises both:
• The incremental costs – e.g. direct labour and materials; and 
• An allocation of other direct costs – e.g. an allocation of the depreciation charge for an item of 
   property, plant and equipment used in fulfilling the contract.

IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of
International Financial
Reporting Standards
The amendment permits a subsidiary (as a first-time adopter of 
IFRS that applies IFRS later than its parent) that applies IFRS 1. 
D16(a) to measure cumulative translation differences using the 
amounts reported by its parent, based on the parent’s date of 
transition to IFRSs.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
The amendment clarifies that for the purpose of performing the 
‘’10 per cent test” for derecognition of financial liabilities – in 
determining those fees paid net of fees received, a borrower in-
cludes only fees paid or received between the borrower and the 
lender, including fees paid or received by either the borrower or 
lender on the other’s behalf.
IFRS 16 Leases
The amendment removes the illustration of payments from the 
lessor relating to leasehold improvements. As currently drafted, 
this example is not clear as to why such payments are not a lease 
incentive.
IAS 41 Agriculture
The amendment removes the requirement to exclude cash flows 
for taxation when measuring fair value, thereby aligning the fair 
value measurement requirements in IAS 41 with those in IFRS 13 
Fair Value Measurement.

cumulative effect of applying the amendments will be recognised as an opening balance adjustment to 
retained earnings or other component of equity, as appropriate. The comparatives will not be restated. 
Earlier application is permitted. The Bank will make an assessment of the impact of this adoption.

Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16)
The amendment prohibits deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any 
proceeds from selling items produced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary 
for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Instead, an entity recognises 
the proceeds from selling such items, and the cost of producing those items, in profit or loss.
Proceeds from selling items before the related item of property, plant and equipment is available for 
use should be recognised in profit or loss, together with the costs of producing those items. IAS 2 
Inventories should be applied in identifying and measuring these production costs.
Companies will therefore need to distinguish between:
• Costs associated with producing and selling items before the item of property, plant and equipment 
    is available for use; and 
• Costs associated with making the item of property, plant and equipment available for its intended 
    use.
Making this allocation of costs may require significant estimation and judgement. 
The amendments apply for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2022, with earlier 
application permitted. The amendments apply retrospectively, but only to items of property, plant and 
equipment made available for use on or after the beginning of the earliest period presented in the 
financial statements in which the company first applies the amendments.
The Bank will make an assessment of the impact of this adoption.
Reference to the Conceptual Framework (Amendments to IFRS 3)
 The amendment has:
• Updated IFRS 3 so that it refers to the 2018 Conceptual Framework instead of the 1989 Framework; 
• Added to IFRS 3 a requirement that, for transactions and other events within the scope of IAS 37 
   or IFRIC 21, an acquirer applies IAS 37 or IFRIC 21 (instead of the Conceptual Framework) to 
   identify the liabilities it has assumed in a business combination; and
• Added to IFRS 3 an explicit statement that an acquirer does not recognise contingent assets 
   acquired in a business combination.
The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2022. Early application is 
permitted if an entity also applies all other updated references (published together with the updated 
Conceptual Framework) at the same time or earlier.
The Bank will make an assessment of the impact of this adoption.
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (and Its Related Amendments)
IFRS 17 supersedes IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and aims to increase comparability and transparency 
about profitability.  The new standard introduces a new comprehensive model (“general model”) for the 
recognition and measurement of liabilities arising from insurance contracts. In addition, it includes 
a simplified approach and modifications to the general measurement model that can be applied in 
certain circumstances and to specific contracts, such as:

IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (and Its Related Amendments) - (Continued)
• Reinsurance contracts held;
• Direct participating contracts; and
• Investment contracts with discretionary participation features.
Under the new standard, investment components are excluded from insurance revenue and service 
expenses. Entities can also choose to present the effect of changes in discount rates and other financial 
risks in profit or loss or OCI.
The new standard includes various new disclosures and requires additional granularity in disclosures 
to assist users to assess the effects of insurance contracts on the entity’s financial statements.
The entity is in the process of determining the impact of IFRS 17 and will provide more detailed 
disclosure on the impact in future financial statements.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2023. Early adoption is permitted 
only if the entity applied IFRS 9. 
The Bank will make an assessment of the impact of this adoption.
Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1)
Under existing IAS 1 requirements, companies classify a liability as current when they do not have an 
unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the end of the 
reporting period. As part of its amendments, the Board has removed the requirement for a right to be 
unconditional and instead, now requires that a right to defer settlement must have substance and exist 
at the end of the reporting period.
There is limited guidance on how to determine whether a right has substance and the assessment may 
require management to exercise interpretive judgement.
The existing requirement to ignore management’s intentions or expectations for settling a liability 
when determining its classification is unchanged. 
The amendments are to be applied retrospectively from the effective date. 
The Bank will make an assessment of the impact of this adoption.
Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8)
Distinguishing between accounting policies and accounting estimates is important because changes 
in accounting policies are generally applied retrospectively, while changes in accounting estimates are 
applied prospectively.
The changes to IAS 8 focus entirely on accounting estimates and clarify the following:
• The definition of a change in accounting estimates is replaced with a definition of accounting 
    estimates. 
• Under the new definition, accounting estimates are “monetary amounts in financial statements 
    that are subject to measurement uncertainty”.

Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8) – (Continued)
•  Entities develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require items in financial statements 
    to be measured in a way that involves measurement uncertainty. 
•  The Board clarified that a change in accounting estimate that results from new information or 
    new developments is not the correction of an error. In addition, the effects of a change in an 
    input or a measurement technique used to develop an accounting estimate are changes in 
    accounting estimates if they do not result from the correction of prior period errors.
•  A change in an accounting estimate may affect only the current period’s profit or loss, or the 
    profit or loss of both the current period and future periods. The effect of the change relating to 
    the current period is recognised as income or expense in the current period. The effect, if any, 
    on future periods is recognised as income or expense in those future periods.
The effects of changes in inputs and/or measurement techniques are changes in accounting 
estimates. The definition of accounting policies remains unchanged.
The amendments are effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2023, with earlier application 
permitted, and will apply prospectively to changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting 
policies occurring on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period in which the company 
applies the amendments.
The Bank will make an assessment of the impact of this adoption.
Disclosure Initiative: Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2)
Making information in financial statements more relevant and less cluttered has been one of the key 
focus areas for the International Accounting Standards Board (the Board).
The Board has issued amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and an update 
to IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements to help companies provide useful 
accounting policy disclosures. The key amendments to IAS 1 include:
• Requiring companies to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant 
    accounting policies;
• Several paragraphs are added to explain how an entity can identify material accounting policy 
    information and to give examples of when accounting policy information is likely to be material;
• Clarifying that accounting policies related to immaterial transactions, other events or conditions 
   are themselves immaterial and as such need not be disclosed; 
• Clarifying that not all accounting policies that relate to material transactions, other events or 
   conditions are themselves material to a company’s financial statements;
• Accounting policy information may be material because of its nature, even if the related amounts 
   are immaterial;
• Accounting policy information is material if users of an entity’s financial statements would need 
   it to understand other material information in the financial statements; and 
• The amendments clarify that if an entity discloses immaterial accounting policy information 
   such information shall not obscure material accounting policy information.
The Board also amended IFRS Practice Statement 2 to include guidance and two additional examples 
on the application of materiality to accounting policy disclosures. The amendments are consistent 
with the refined definition of material.

Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction (Amendment to IAS 12)
The amendment clarifies that the initial recognition exemption does not apply to transactions that give 
rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences such as leases and decommissioning obligations. 
As a result, companies will need to recognise a deferred tax asset and a deferred tax liability for 
temporary differences arising on initial recognition of a lease and a decommissioning provision.
The Bank will make an assessment of the impact of this adoption.
Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and Its Associate or Joint Venture (Amendments to 
IFRS 10 and IAS 28)
The amendments require the full gain to be recognised when assets transferred between an 
investor and its associate or joint venture meet the definition of a ‘business’ under IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations. Where the assets transferred do not meet the definition of a business, a partial gain 
to the extent of unrelated investors’ interests in the associate or joint venture is recognised. The 
definition of a business is key to determining the extent of the gain to be recognised.
When a parent loses control of a subsidiary in a transaction with an associate or joint venture (JV), 
there is a conflict between the existing guidance on consolidation and equity accounting. 
Under the consolidation standard, the parent recognises the full gain on the loss of control. But under 
the standard on associates and JVs, the parent recognises the gain only to the extent of unrelated 
investors’ interests in the associate or JV. In either case, the loss is recognised in full if the underlying 
assets are impaired.
In response to this conflict and the resulting diversity in practice, on 11 September 2014 the IASB issued 
Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (Amendments 
to IFRS 10 and IAS 28). The IASB has decided to defer the effective date for these amendments 
indefinitely. Adoption is still permitted.
A number of new standards and ammendments to satndards are effective for annual periods beginning 
after 1 January 2022 and earlier application is permitted, however, the Group has not yet early adopted 
the new and amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial satements.
The following new and amended standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements.  
• Classification of Liablities as Current or Non current (Amendments to IAS 1);
• IFRS 17 Insurance contracts and ammendments to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts;
• Lease liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16); and
• Definition of Accounting estimates (Amendments to IAS 8).
In addition to this, the bank will include all new or amended standards and their possible impact on 
the consolidated financial statements.

(5)  FINANCIAL RISK REVIEW
The Group is exposed to the following financial risks from financial instruments, for which it conducts 
regular risk management efforts: 
• Credit risk;
• Liquidity risk;
• Market risk;
• Capital management; and
• Operational risk.
This note presents information about the Bank’s exposure to each of the above risks, and Company’s 
objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risks. Further quantitative disclosures 
are included throughout separate financial statement.
Risk Management Framework
The Board of Directors of the Bank has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the 
Bank’s risk management framework. The Board has established the Loan and Risk Review Committee 
(LRRC) through the Loan and Risk Review Committee charter, which is responsible for providing the 
standards and minimum parameters to be followed in managing the bank’s exposure to risk. Besides, it 
is also responsible for developing and monitoring effectiveness of the Bank´s risk management policies 
and the degree of compliance to national and international regulatory standards. The LLRC reports 
regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.
The Bank's risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Bank, 
to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to those limits. The risk 
management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and 
the Bank's activities. The Bank through its training management standards and procedures aims to 
develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all the employees understand their 
roles and obligations.
The Board Audit Committee of Commercial Bank of Ethiopia oversees how management monitors 
compliance with the Bank´s risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of 
the risk management framework in relation to the risk faced by the Bank. The Bank´s Board Audit 
Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit function. Internal Audit undertakes both 
regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are 
reported to the Bank´s Audit Committee.
In addition, the Bank is subject to the regulations of the National Bank of Ethiopia with respect to, 
among others matters, comprehensive risk management, liquidity and capitalization.

(a) Credit Risk - (Continued)
The term bankable indicates that the borrower’s loan request is feasible and acceptable by the Bank, 
after passing through rigorous business and risk analysis. 
CBE classifies its credit customers in order to identify those who contribute high value to its profitability 
and growth and thereby enhance service quality and customer satisfaction. The classification is 
made based on the result of the analysis of parameters that are allotted with weight such as income 
generated from the customer (30%), total credit exposure (20%), customer’s credit risk grade (25%) 
and sales volume registered (20%). 
CBE’s credit risk grading is only applicable to borrowers classified as Corporate, Business and 
Commercial class customers, except for new customer/newly established business. The grading 
parameters are mainly five that encompass sub-parameters allotted with score from 100 points.

Grade 1: Loan debtors are labeled as “exceptionally low risk” borrowers at the time of the risk review 
                period where the overall score is 85% and above. 
•  Loans and advances fully secured by cash and cash substitute, regardless of the loan status.
•  The borrower has strong repayment capacity, excellent track records in servicing debt regularly, 
          and is not subject to criticism.  
Grade 2: They are classified as “very low risk borrowers, if they meet the following criteria during the 
                issuance of credit risk grade.
•  These borrowers are not as strong as Grade 1 borrowers in terms of credit risk parameters.
•  The borrower has strong repayment capacity. 
•  The borrower has excellent liquidity and low leverage.
•  The business demonstrates consistently strong earnings and cash flows. 
•  The borrower has well established and strong market share.
•  CBE has confidence on the management of the business.
•  The loan is performing in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.
Grade 3: These borrowers are considered as “low risk” borrowers, being capable of meeting the
                following criteria.
•  Not as strong as the Grade 2 in terms of credit risk parameters, but the business still
     demonstrates consistent earnings, cash flow and have good track record.
•  The borrower has adequate liquidity, cash flow and earnings.
•  The borrower has acceptable share in the market.
•  The business has acceptable management capability.
•  The business is performing in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.
Grade 4: These borrowers are rated as “moderate risk” borrowers given the fact that they demonstrate 
                 the following features when the grade is issued.
•  They are not as strong as Grade 3 in terms of credit risk parameters.
•  The loans and advances show sign of irregularity, or have arrears (the credit facilities have been 
     inactive).
•  The borrower needs attention due to conditions affecting the business, the industry, or the
     economic environment.
•  The borrower has above average risk due to strained liquidity, higher than normal leverage, thin 
     cash flow and/or inconsistent earning.
•  The borrower may incur loss.
Grade 5: They are debtors with “potential risk” witnessed by the following results from the credit risk 
                grading analysis.
•  Lower than Grade 4 in terms of credit risk parameters.
•  The borrower has potential weaknesses that deserve CBE’s close attention. If left uncorrected, 
         these weaknesses may result in a deterioration of the repayment prospects of the borrower.

•  The loans and advance show extended irregularities, or have the arrears (the credit facilities have 
     been inactive).
•  Severe management problem exists.
•  Credit facilities should be downgraded to this grade if sustained deterioration in financial condition 
    is noted (consecutive losses, negative net worth and excessive leverage). 
Grade 6: These are “high risk” borrowers.
•  Financial condition is weak and capacity or inclination to repay is in doubt.
•  These weaknesses jeopardized full settlement of credit facilities.
Grade 7: “very high risk” borrowers
•  Full repayment of principal and interest is unlikely and the possibility of loss is extremely high.
•  However, due to especially identifiable pending factors, such as litigation, liquidation procedures 
     and capital injection, the asset is not yet classified as loss.
Grade 8: “default risk”
•  The loan has been long outstanding with no progress in obtaining repayment or on the verge of 
     liquidation/wind up.
•  Prospect of recovery is poor and legal options have been pursued or initiated.
•  Proceeds expected from the liquidation or realization of security may be awaited.
•  CBE’s criteria for timely write-off shall be adhered to apply.
In order to classify the outstanding loans according to the risk grade of debtor, the following assumptions 
are used because of the fact that retail loans are not regularly graded except at the initial stage of the 
credit assessment.
•  Loan disbursed to Business, Corporate and Commercial customers are presented according to 
     their risk grade from the risk grading analysis.
•  Emergency staff loan, staff personal loan and staff mortgage loan are assigned grade 1 because 
    of the fact that such loans are regularly repaid from salary account of the staff without any 
    delinquency and arrears.
All loans and that are unrated assumed to be graded as follows:
•   All ungraded Pass status retail loans are assigned with grade 2.
•   All ungraded Special Mention status retail loans are assigned with risk grade 3.
•   All ungraded Sub-standard  status retail loans are assigned with risk grade 5.
•   All ungraded Doubtful status retail loans are assigned with risk grade 6.
•   All ungraded Loss status retail loans are assigned with risk grade 7.
•   All loans and advances under litigation decision (ALD) are assigned with risk grade 8.
The risk grade classification and the underlying assumptions are made based on the analysis of the 
repayment trend of retail borrowers and default history in the Bank over the past five years.

Inputs, Assumptions and Techniques Used for Estimating Impairment
See accounting policy in Note 4(c)(viii).
Significant Increase in Credit Risk
When determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased significantly 
since initial recognition, the Bank considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant 
and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information 
an analysis, based on the Bank’s historical experience and expert credit assessment and including 
forward-looking information.
The objective of the assessment is to identify whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred 
for an exposure by comparing:
• The remaining lifetime probability of default (PD) as at the reporting date; with
• The remaining lifetime PD for this point in time that was estimated at the time of initial recognition 
of the exposure (adjusted where relevant for changes in prepayment expectations).
Credit Risk Grading 
The Bank has applied the days past due approach to determine the credit risk grading for financial 
assets classified at amortised cost for purposes of estimating PDs. 
Generating the Term Structure of PD
Credit risk grades are a primary input into the determination of the term structure of PD for exposures. 
The Bank collects performance and default information about its credit risk exposures analysed by 
economic sector. 
The Bank employs statistical models to analyse the data collected and generate estimates of the 
remaining lifetime PD of exposures and how these are expected to change as a result of the passage of 
time.
This analysis includes the identification and calibration of relationships between changes in default rates 
and changes in key macro-economic factors as well as in-depth analysis of the impact of certain other 
factors (e.g. forbearance experience) on the risk of default. For most exposures, key macro-economic 
indicators include: GDP growth, benchmark interest rates and exchange rate.
Based on advice from the Risk Committees and economic experts and consideration of a variety of 
external actual and forecast information, the Bank formulates a ‘base case’ view of the future direction 
of relevant economic variables as well as a representative range of other possible forecast scenarios 
(see discussion below on incorporation of forward-looking information). The Bank then uses these 
forecasts to adjust its estimates of PDs.

(5) FINANCIAL RISK REVIEW - (Continued) 
(a)  Credit Risk - (Continued)
Determining whether Credit Risk Has Increased Significantly
The criteria for determining whether credit risk has increased significantly vary by portfolio and include 
quantitative changes in PDs and qualitative factors, including a backstop based on delinquency.
The credit risk of a particular exposure is deemed to have increased significantly since initial recognition 
if, based on the Bank’s quantitative modelling, the days past due excedes 30 days. 
Using its expert credit judgement and, where possible, relevant historical experience, the Bank may 
determine that an exposure has undergone a significant increase in credit risk based on particular 
qualitative indicators that it considers are indicative of such and whose effect may not otherwise be fully 
reflected in its quantitative analysis on a timely basis. 
As a backstop, the Bank considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when 
an asset is more than 30 days past due. Days past due are determined by counting the number of days 
since the earliest elapsed due date in respect of which full payment has not been received. Due dates are 
determined without considering any grace period that might be available to the borrower.
The Bank monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify significant increases in credit risk by 
regular reviews to confirm that:
• The criteria are capable of identifying significant increases in credit risk before an exposure is in 
    default;
• The criteria do not align with the point in time when an asset becomes 30 days past due; and
•  There is no unwarranted volatility in loss allowance from transfers between 12-month PD(stage 1) 
    and lifetime PD (stage 2).
Modified Financial Assets
The contractual terms of a loan may be modified for a number of reasons, including changing market 
conditions, customer retention and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration 
of the customer. An existing loan whose terms have been modified may be derecognised and the 
renegotiated loan recognised as a new loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy set out 
in Note 4.
When the terms of a financial asset are modified and the modification does not result in derecognition, 
the determination of whether the asset’s credit risk has increased significantly reflects comparison of:
• Its remaining lifetime PD at the reporting date based on the modified terms; with
• The remaining lifetime PD estimated based on data at initial recognition and the original contractual 
    terms.
The Bank renegotiates loans to customers in financial difficulties (referred to as ‘for bearance activities’) 
to maximise collection opportunities and minimise the risk of default. Under the Bank’s forbearance 
policy, loan forbearance is granted on a selective basis if the debtor is currently in default on its debt or if 
there is a high risk of default, there is evidence that the debtor made all reasonable efforts to pay under 
the original contractual terms and the debtor is expected to be able to meet the revised terms.

(5) FINANCIAL RISK REVIEW - (Continued) 
(a)  Credit Risk - (Continued)
Modified Financial Assets - (Continued)
The revised terms usually include extending the maturity, changing the timing of interest payments and 
amending the terms of loan covenants. Both retail and corporate loans are subject to the forbearance 
policy. The Bank Audit Committee regularly reviews reports on forbearance activities.
For financial assets modified as part of the Bank’s forbearance policy, the estimate of PD reflects 
whether the modification has improved or restored the Bank’s ability to collect interest and principal 
and the Bank’s previous experience of similar forbearance action. As part of this process, the Bank 
evaluates the borrower’s payment performance against the modified contractual terms and considers 
various behavioural indicators.
Generally, forbearance is a qualitative indicator of a significant increase in credit risk and an expectation 
of forbearance may constitute evidence that an exposure is credit-impaired /in default. A customer 
needs to demonstrate consistently good payment behaviour over a period of time before the exposure is 
no longer considered to be credit-impaired/ in default or the PD is considered to have decreased such 
that the loss allowance reverts to being measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECL.
Definition of Default
The Bank considers a financial asset to be in default when:
• The borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank in full, without recourse by the Bank 
   to actions such as realising security (if any is held); or
• The borrower is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the Bank. Overdrafts 
   are considered as being past due once the customer has breached an advised limit or been advised 
   of a limit smaller than the current amount outstanding.
In assessing whether a borrower is in default, the Bank considers indicators that are:
• Qualitative – e.g. breaches of covenant;
• Quantitative – e.g. overdue status and non-payment on another obligation of the same issuer to the 
   Bank; and
• Based on data developed internally and obtained from external sources.
Inputs into the assessment of whether a financial instrument is in default and their significance may 
vary over time to reflect changes in circumstances.
The definition of default largely aligns with that applied by the Bank for regulatory capital purposes.
Incorporation of Forward-looking Information
The Bank incorporates forward-looking information into both its assessment of whether the credit risk 
of an instrument has increased significantly since its initial recognition and its measurement of ECL. 
Based on advice from the Bank Market Risk Committee and economic experts and consideration of a 
variety of external actual and forecast information, the Group formulates three economic scenarios: a 
base case, which is the central scenario, base don available projections, and two less likely scenarios, 
one upside and one downside scenario. Both the upside and downside scenarios are derived from 
analysis of historical volatilities on each identified macroeconomic variable.

Incorporation of Forward-looking Information - (Continued)
The Bank applies, in modelling of forward-looking information, Ethiopian historical macroeconomic 
data and forecasts published by Business Monitor International (BMI), a reputable external data body.
The scenario probability weightings are derived from each segment’s macro economic information 
values. 
PD computed for ECL estimation is point-in-time. It captures all macroeconomic factors that will 
affect PD estimate in the future. Therefore, the impact of forward-looking indicators on PD has to 
been analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in order to generate FLI adjusted PD.
The Cox proportional hazards model's exponent function is used to compute the FLI adjusters as a 
function of PCA coefficients and macroeconomic projections on a base, upside and downside basis. 
PCA coefficient values are used as base probability weights and split the difference equally for upside 
and downside scenarios.
The Bank has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for each portfolio 
of financial instruments and, using an analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between 
macro-economic variables and credit risk and credit losses. The economic scenarios used as at 30 
June 2022 included the following key indicators:
•  Real GDP growth rate;
•  Gross national expenditure (% of GDP);
•  Real rate of interest (lending);
•  Gross national savings;
•  Gross national income;
•  Exports of goods and services;
•  Debts servicing;
•  Import of goods and services;
•  Real rate of interest (time deposit);
•  Gross domestic savings; and
•  Official exchange rate.
Predicted relationships between the key indicators and default and loss rates on various portfolios of 
financial assets have been developed based on analysing historical data over the past 10 to 15 years.
Measurement of ECL 
The key inputs into the measurement of ECL are the term structure of the following variables:
• Probability of default (PD);
• Loss given default (LGD); and
• Exposure at default (EAD).
These parameters are generally derived from internally developed statistical models and other 
historical data. They are adjusted to reflect forward-looking information as described above. PD 
estimates are estimates at a certain date, which are calculated, based on statistical models, and 
assessed using tools tailored to the various categories of counterparties and exposures.

(a)  Credit Risk - (Continued)
Measurement of ECL - (Continued)
These statistical models are based on internally compiled data comprising both quantitative and 
qualitative factors. Where it is available, market data may also be used to derive the PD for loans and 
advances to banks and investment securities. 
LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Bank estimates LGD parameters based 
mainly on the counterparties’ collateral and also on the history of recovery rates of claims against 
defaulted counterparties. The LGD models consider the structure, collateral, seniority of the claim; 
counterparty industry and recovery costs of any collateral that is integral to the financial asset. They 
are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis using the effective interest rate as the discounting 
factor.
EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Bank derives the EAD from the 
current exposure to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the 
contract including amortisation. The EAD of a financial asset is its gross carrying amount. For lending 
commitments and financial guarantees, the EAD includes the amount drawn, as well as potential future 
amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated based on historical observations 
and forward-looking forecasts.
As described above, and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for financial assets for which 
credit risk has not significantly increased, the Bank measures ECL considering the risk of default 
over the maximum contractual period (including any borrower’s extension options) over which it is 
exposed to credit risk, even if, for risk management purposes, the Bank considers a longer period. The 
maximum contractual period extends to the date at which the Bank has the right to require repayment 
of an advance or terminate a loan commitment or guarantee.
Where modelling of a parameter is carried out on a collective basis, the financial instruments are 
grouped on the basis of shared risk characteristics that include:
•  Instrument type;
•  Credit risk gradings;
•  Collateral type;
•  Date of initial recognition;
•  Industry; and
•  Geographic location of the borrower.
The groupings are subject to regular review to ensure that exposures within a particular group remain 
appropriately homogeneous.

Default but not Impaired Loans
According to the NBE’s directive No. SBB/69/2018, non-performing (defaulted) loan refers to loans or 
advances whose credit quality has deteriorated such that full collection of principal and/or interest 
in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions is in question.  Loans with pre-established 
repayment program are non-performing (impaired) when principal and/or interest is due or uncollected 
for 90 consecutive days or more.
Overdrafts and other advances that do not have pre-established repayment program are non-performing 
(defaulted) when:
• The debt remains outstanding for 90 consecutive days or more beyond the scheduled payment date 
   or maturity
• The debt exceeds the borrower’s approved limit for 90 consecutive days or more.
• Interest is due and uncollected for 90 consecutive days or more.
• For overdrafts, 
     - The account has been inactive for 90 consecutive days or more;
- Deposits are insufficient to cover the interest capitalized during 90 consecutive days; or
- The account fails to show debit balance of 5% or less from the approved limit at least once over 
     360 days preceding the date of loan review.
While managing credit risk, default is considered to have occurred with regard to particular obligor 
when either or both of the following two events have occurred.
Loans secured by cash or cash substitute guarantees and/or sources of payment that are enough to 
cover the carrying value are deemed default but not impaired, that means, with no losses incurred.
Restructured/Renegotiated Loans 
Renegotiated loans or advances refers to loans which have been refinanced, rescheduled, rolled over, 
or otherwise modified at favorable terms and conditions for the borrower because of weaknesses in the 
borrower’s financial condition or ability to repay.
Non-performing loans are restructured when the result of analysis on the obligor’s financial capacity 
witnesses the need to modify/change the original terms and conditions of the loan contract in order to 
recover the outstanding loan. As per CBE’s problem loans management procedure, any NPL (defaulted 
loan) is worked out and restructured by taking either of the following changes or combined options.
•  Extension of the repayment period with the consent of the concerned parties 
    (borrower and guarantor);
•  Changing the form of the loan fully or partially (e.g. overdraft to a term loan);
•  Requesting additional collateral or change of collateral;
•  Cross-collateralizing multiple loans;
•  Including additional covenants;
•  Arranging transfer of loans from one borrower to other borrowers upon request by the borrower, 
    based on the mutual agreement of both the borrower and the would-be buyer of the loan, when 
    an acceptable agreement is submitted to the Bank and a new buyer of the loan is deemed to be 
    better than the actual customer;

    justifiable reasons; and
•  An existing loan whose terms have been modified may be derecognized and the renegotiated 
    loan recognized as a new loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy. Once a non-
    performing loan has been restructured, it doesn’t remains in the same category of loan status as 
    prior to the restructuring. However, the status (category) is turned to “substandard), without 
    prejudice to the standard definition of substandard when:
     (a) Renegotiated term loans equivalent of all past due interest is paid by the borrower in cash at the 
          time of renegotiation and the following payments are made by the borrower on a consistent and 
         timely basis in accordance with the restructured terms of the loan or advance:
 -  Loans with monthly or quarterly installment payments, at least 3(three) consecutive 
     repayments;
 -  Loans with semi-annual installment repayments, at least 2(two) installments;
 -  Loans with annual installment repayments, at least one repayment.
    (b) Renegotiated non-performing overdraft facilities equivalent of all past due interest is paid by 
             the borrower in cash at the time of renegotiation and the account shows at a minimum:
 -   A nil balance at least once;
 -   A turnover rate of once the approved limit.
 Write-off Policy
The Bank determines the write-off of a loan or group of loans demonstrating non-recoverability. This 
determination is made after performing an analysis of the financial conditions from the date of default 
and the likelihood of recovering such loans.
As per the credit procedure a loan is written-off when the Bank exhausts all means to recover the 
outstanding loan. It is uncertain to know how long it will take to get court verdict on litigations to recover 
the outstanding amount of defaulted loans from other attachable properties registered in the name 
of the defaulters. Hence, doesn’t consider time limit for write-offs. Defaulted loans are written-off 
immediately after exhausting all means to recover the loan.
After having fully exhausted all possible means for the recovery of loans and advances and after 
ascertaining that the property held as collateral does not cover the loan in full; and after having 
ascertained that there is no other attachable property to cover the remaining balance fully or partially, 
the recovery area shall compile evidence to support that the loan or part of the loan it proposes to write-
off is unrecoverable.
Loan write-offs can be initiated for the following reasons:
•  Absence of  attachable property;
•  Insolvency of the borrower;
•  Declaration of bankruptcy of the borrower by a court;

Collateral
CBE has guarantee on loans granted, mainly Government bond and written government undertaking by 
the Ministry of Finance, Motor Vehicles, Buildings and other class of collaterals.
Fair value estimates are based on the value of guarantees at the time loans commitments are originated. 
The Bank has technical employees (appraisers) for a constant monitoring of these collaterals in order 
to update such fair values if it is necessary. In addition, the fair value of collateral is updated when a loan 
is individually assessed as impaired or by any change in conditions that the debtor request in advance 
and in the case of project financing, according to the progress of work.
While estimating the value of the collateral held, CBE may opt to use the cost sales comparison or 
income valuation approach as appropriate. Every collateralized property is insured by appropriate 
insurance company and they have 100% insurance policy coverage against perils related the property.
According to credit procedure of CBE, collateralized building and other real properties are revalued 
every five year. However, a revaluation of collateral may be undertaken at any time if either of the 
following conditions materializes. 
•  If a sudden price decline of the property held as collateral is ascertained or suspected.
•  When a report is received evidencing that the property held as collateral has sustained damages 
     or master plan changes that affects the value of the collateral.
•  When noticeable construction is added to the collateral held.
•  When the Bank decides to foreclose the collateral.
The table below shows the value of collateral held by CBE as a security for loans granted as at 30 June 
2022 and 30 June 2021.

(a) Credit Risk - (Continued)
Collateral - (Continued)
As can be seen from the above table, the value of collateral held by CBE as a security for loan granted are 
measured when the loans are initially granted. The overall collateral coverage ratio to the outstanding 
principal loan is estimated about 212%,(2021: 237%).
In conducting the credit analysis of loan case, collateral coverage ratio is considered apart from loan 
granted on clean basis. The borrower can pledge one collateral for many loans or different collaterals 
for single loan or different types of collateral for different loans. 
Concentration of Credit Risk
The table intends to briefly indicate the loan portfolio Vs security covered by different class of collaterals 
at the reporting date. While factoring the collateral for loan provision coverage it is adjusted to the 
computuation of EAD.
Some of the collateral classes are very liquid and equivalent to cash such as blocked account balance 
and government bond. The collateral data indicates the balance of collateral securities held by CBE for 
loans and advances disbursed up to 30 June 2021.
The Bank analyzes credit risk concentration by sector and geographic location. The analysis of credit 
risk concentration as of the reporting date of the financial statement is described as follows:

(b)  Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group either does not have sufficient resources available to meet all its 
obligations and commitments as and when they fall due, or can only access these financial resources 
at excessive cost. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that 
it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed 
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation and 
security. 
The Group manages liquidity risk both a short-term and medium-term basis. In short-term, the focus 
is on ensuring that the cash flow demands can be met through asset maturities, customer deposits 
and wholesale funding where required. In the medium-term, the focus is on ensuring the statement of 
financial position remains structurally sound. 
The Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) and the Risk Management Committee regularly 
monitor the liquidity position by analyzing the maturity structure of assets and liabilities, the stability of 
deposits by customer type and the compliance to minimum standards set forth by the regulations and 
corporate policies.
The key measure used by the Group for managing liquidity risk is the ratio of net liquid assets to deposits 
from customers. Net liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and negotiable financial instruments 
that mature in less than 186 days from the date of issue. 
The Group also monitors on a regular basis the advances to deposits ratio. This is defined as the ratio 
of total loans and advances to customers relative to total customer deposits. A low advance to deposit 
ratio demonstrates that customer deposits are in excess of customer loans due to the emphasis placed 
on generating a high level of stable funding from customers.

(5)  FINANCIAL RISK REVIEW - (Continued) 
(b) Liquidity Risk - (Continued)
It is assumed that the fair value of the liquid assets is equivalent to the carrying amount since no 
discounting is involved to realize these assets into cash.
Customer deposits up to three months represent current, savings and call deposit account balances, 
which past experience has shown to be stable and of a long-term nature.
Liquidity risk arises in the general funding of the Group’s activities and in the management of positions. 
It includes both the risk of being unable to fund assets at appropriate maturities and rates, and the risk 
of being unable to liquidate an asset at a reasonable price and in an appropriate time frame.
The Group has access to a diverse funding base. Funds are raised using a broad range of instruments 
including deposits and other liabilities. This enhances flexibility, limits dependence on any source of 
funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. The Group strives to maintain a balance between continuity 
of funding and flexibility through the use of liabilities with a range of maturities. The Group continually 
assesses liquidity risk by identifying and monitoring changes in funding required meeting business 
goals and targets set in terms of the overall Group strategy.
(c)  Market Risk
The Group recognizes market risk as the risk of loss arising from changes in market prices and 
rates. The Group’s exposure to market risk arises principally from customer-driven transactions and 
recognizes that the value of on and off-balance sheet positions of the Group are adversely affected 
by the movement in the market prices or rates such as interest rate, exchange rate, equity prices 
and commodity price that may result in loss for the Group. The objective of the Group’s market risk 
policies and processes is to obtain the best balance between risk and return whilst meeting customers’ 
requirements.  
The Group’s exposure to potential market risk arises mainly due to the open interest rate and exchange 
rate positions. All these elements are exposed to general and specific market movements and may 
result in the reduction of the value of a financial asset. The Asset and Liability Management Committee 
(ALCO) authorize the established limits and monitor results.
(a)  Interest Rate Risk
The interest rate risk is the exposure of the financial position of the Group to any losses arising from 
adverse movements in interest rates.
The Group monitors the sensitivity of changes in interest rates, and determines the balance structure, 
different item terms and investment strategies.
The table below summarizes the exposure to interest rate risks. Included in the table below are the 
Group’s assets and liabilities at carrying amounts, categorized by the earlier of contractual re-pricing 
or maturity dates.

(b) Exchange Rate Risk 
Exchange rate risk is the risk a financial instrument’s value fluctuates as a result of changes in the 
exchange rates of foreign currencies and other financial variables. Foreign exchange rate risks arise 
from financial instruments denominated in currencies other than the Bank’s functional currency.
The Group’s foreign currency denominated assets and liability accounts may result in translational 
gain/loss depending on the net open position and direction of the exchange rate movement. To control 
the risk, the net position in each foreign currency is managed on a daily basis. 
The various foreign currencies to which the Group is exposed to are summarized below:

Sensitivity Analysis
As can be witnessed in the exchange rate movement during the year, the tendency of further depreciation 
of Birr is probable. Hence, we have considered two senarios of Birr devaluation by 15%. In order to see 
the impact on the financial performance of CBE, the sensitivity is applied to the open position in USD, 
GBP and other currencies.
(d) Operational Risk Management
 
Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss arising from a wide variety of causes associated 
with the Group’s processes, personnel, technology and infrastructure and from external factors other 
than credit, market and liquidity risks such as those arising from legal and regulatory requirements 
and generally accepted standards of corporate behavior.
The Group seeks to ensure that key operational risks are managed in a timely and effective manner 
through a framework of policies, procedures and tools to identify, assess, monitor, control and report 
such risks. 
Operational risks arise from all of the Group’s operations and are faced by all business units. As such, 
the Group seeks to ensure that key operational risks are managed in a timely and effective manner 
through a framework of policies, procedures and tools to identify, assess, control and report such risks.

(d)  Operational Risk Management  - (Continued)
 	
The scope of operational risk assessment of any process shall be determined based on various factors 
among them:
• The level of perceived risks;
• Previous operational risk assessment risks;
• Business criticality of the activities, process or product under consideration;
• The presence of overarching regulatory requirement; and
• Management’s need for further examination of ongoing operations (such as lines of business, 
   product, service and processes individually or in combinations).
Every risk assessment unit shall perform a risk assessment on its respective processes/units, at least 
on an annual basis. The Risk and Compliance Management process may request for more frequent 
risk assessment, if the need arises, primarily based on the perceived level of risk of the respective risk 
assessment unit/process.
 
(e)  Capital Management
The Group manages its capital based on Basel guidelines as well as local regulation requirements. The 
Commercial Code of Ethiopia through article 80 (capital and reserves) defines capital as the original 
value of the elements put at disposal of the undertaking by the owner or partners by way of contribution 
in kind or in cash. It further stipulates that all profits preserved for the undertaking and not forming part 
of capital shall constitute a reserve.
The statutory regulator, the National Bank of Ethiopia, has issued directive number SBB/4/95 that 
dictates every bank transfer on an annual basis, 25% of its annual net profit to its legal reserve account 
until such account equals its capital. When the legal reserve account equals the Bank’s capital, the 
amount to be transferred to the legal reserve account shall be 10% of the annual net profit.
The Bank’s capital is therefore managed in accordance with NBE directives and proclamation on banking 
business and those of subsidiaries capital is managed in accordance with the commercial code and 
other related laws.
In addition to regulatory requirements, CBE conducts objective analysis on the adequacy of its 
capitalization on a regular basis. Based on the result of rigorous analysis made on capital management 
and adequacy, CBE injects additional capital after proposing the required amount of additional capital 
to the Ministry of Finance and upon approval by the house of peoples’ representatives of the Federal 
Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.
The National Bank of Ethiopia requires a bank to maintain at all times:
•  Primary or Tier 1 capital: state capital/paid-up capital, declared reserves and accumulated profit 
    or loss.
•  Secondary or Tier 2 capital: includes qualified equity instruments. However, CBE does not have any 
    tier-2 capital account in its statement of financial position.
The Bank and its individually regulated subsidiaries have met with all of the external capital requirements 
to which they are subject. As of  30 June 2022, and 30 June 2021 respectively, the Bank’s regulatory 
capital position was as follows:

(6)  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
(a)  Accounting Classifications
Fair value of a price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or in its absence 
the most advantageous market to which the Bank has access at that date. The fair value of a liability 
reflects its non-performance risk.
When applicable, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an 
active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or 
liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing 
basis.
When there is no quoted price in an active market, the Group uses valuation techniques that maximizes 
the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen 
valuation technique incorporates all the factors that market participants would take into account in 
pricing a transaction.
The following sets out the Group’s basis of establishing fair values of financial instruments:
Investment securities with observable market prices including equity securities are fair valued using 
that information. Investment securities that do not have observable market data are fair valued using 
discounted cash flow method or quoted market prices for securities with similar yield characteristics. 
During the current year, there was sufficient information available to measure the fair value of 
financial instruments based on observable market inputs. In the previous year, the available-for-sale 
equity instruments were measured at cost because the fair value was not considered to be reliably 
measurable. 
Loans and advances to customers and loans to micro-finance institutions are net of allowance for 
impairment. The estimated fair value of loans and advances represents the discounted amount of 
future cash flows expected to be received. Expected cash flows are discounted at current market rates 
to determine fair value hence their fair values approximate their carrying amounts.
The estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is the amount repayable on demand. 
Estimated fair value if fixed interest-bearing deposits without quoted market prices is based on 
discounting cash flows using the prevailing market rates for debts with similar maturities and interest 
rates, hence their fair value approximates their carrying amounts.

(20) RIGHT OF USE ASSETS AND FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATIONS – (Continued)
(B)  Finance Lease Obligation
The Group recognizes a lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at 
that date. The Group uses an incremental borrowing rate that is based on the weighted average cost of 
deposits across the years. The rates used to compute the present values of buildings lease liabilities 
as at 30 June 2022 was 4.88% (2021: 4.13%). The rates used to compute the land lease liabilities as at 
30 June 2022 was 9.0% (2021: 9.0%).
The Group leases buildings for its office space and branches. The building leases typically run for a 
period of between 2 and 10 years with majority of the contracts running for a period of 5 and 6 years. 
Some leases include an option to renew the lease for an additional period at the end of the contract 
term. The renewal term and lease rentals cannot be reliably estimated before the end of a contract.
The Group leases land for construction of its own office buildings. The land leases typically run for a 
period of between 40 years and 99 years with majority of the contracts running for a period of 50 and 
60 years. These leases include an option to renew the lease.

iii. Actuarial Assumptions
The principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date are detailed below:
         30 June 2022
         30 June 2021
Discount rate
12.30-13.10%
2.95-13.10%
Salary increase rate
4.95-15.75%
4.95-16.00%
Gold increase rate
15.00-16.00%
15.00%
Long term inflation rate
2.00-13.00%
2.00-12.50%
The assumed discount rates are derived from rates available on government bonds for which the 
timing and amounts of payments match the timing and the amounts of our projected pension 
payments.

(23) EMPLOYEE BENEFITS -  (Continued)
iv. Sensitivity Analysis
Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date, in any of the actuarial assumptions and assuming 
that all the other variables remain constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligations as of 
30 June 2022 by the amounts shown below:
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other 
assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions 
may be correlated.

NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(29)  FINANCIAL RISK REVIEW
The Bank is exposed to the following financial risks from financial instruments, for which it conducts 
regular risk management efforts: 
•  Credit risk;
•  Liquidity risk;
•  Market risk;
•  Capital management; and
•  Operational risk.
This note presents information about the Bank’s exposure to each of the above risks, and the Bank’s 
objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risks. Further quantitative disclosures 
are included throughout separate financial statement.
Risk Management Framework
The Board of Directors of the Bank has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the 
Bank’s risk management framework. The Board has established the Loan and Risk Review Committee 
(LRRC) through the Loan and Risk Review Committee charter, which is responsible for providing the 
standards and minimum parameters to be followed in managing the bank’s exposure to risk. Besides, 
it is also responsible for developing and monitoring effectiveness of the Bank´s risk management 
policies and the degree of compliance to national and international regulatory standards. The LLRC 
reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.
The Bank´s risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the 
Bank, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to those limits. The 
risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions 
and the Bank´s activities. The Bank through its training management standards and procedures aims 
to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all the employees understand 
their roles and obligations.
The Bank’s Board Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Bank´s 
risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management 
framework in relation to the risk faced by the Bank. The Bank´s Board Audit Committee is assisted in 
its oversight role by Internal Audit function. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews 
of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Bank´s Audit 
Committee.
In addition, the Bank is subject to the regulations of the National Bank of Ethiopia with respect to, 
among others matters, comprehensive risk management, liquidity and capitalization.

(b)  Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that theBank either does not have sufficient resources available to meet all its 
obligations and commitments as and when they fall due, or can only access these financial resources 
at excessive cost. The Bank’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that 
it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed 
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Bank’s reputation and 
security. 
The Bank manages liquidity risk both a short-term and medium-term basis. In short-term, the focus 
is on ensuring that the cash flow demands can be met through asset maturities, customer deposits 
and wholesale funding where required. In the medium-term, the focus is on ensuring the statement of 
financial position remains structurally sound. 
The Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) and the Risk Management Committee regularly 
monitor the liquidity position by analyzing the maturity structure of assets and liabilities, the stability of 
deposits by customer type and the compliance to minimum standards set forth by the regulations and 
corporate policies.
The key measure used by the Bank for managing liquidity risk is the ratio of net liquid assets to deposits 
from customers. Net liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and negotiable financial instruments 
that mature in less than 186 days from the date of issue. 
The Bank also monitors on a regular basis the advances to deposits ratio. This is defined as the ratio 
of total loans and advances to customers relative to total customer deposits. A low advance to deposit 
ratio demonstrates that customer deposits are in excess of customer loans due to the emphasis placed 
on generating a high level of stable funding from customers.

(29)  FINANCIAL RISK REVIEW - (Continued)
(b) Liquidity Risk - (Continued)
It is assumed that the fair value of the liquid assets is equivalent to the carrying amount since no 
discounting is involved to realize these assets into cash.
Customer deposits up to three months represent current, savings and call deposit account balances, 
which past experience has shown to be stable and of a long-term nature.
Liquidity risk arises in the general funding of the Bank’s activities and in the management of positions. 
It includes both the risk of being unable to fund assets at appropriate maturities and rates, and the risk 
of being unable to liquidate an asset at a reasonable price and in an appropriate time frame.
The Bank has access to a diverse funding base. Funds are raised using a broad range of instruments 
including deposits and other liabilities. This enhances flexibility, limits dependence on any source of 
funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. The Bank strives to maintain a balance between continuity 
of funding and flexibility through the use of liabilities with a range of maturities. The Bank continually 
assesses liquidity risk by identifying and monitoring changes in funding required meeting business 
goals and targets set in terms of the overall Bank strategy.
(c)  Market Risk
The Bank recognizes market risk as the risk of loss arising from changes in market prices and rates. The 
Bank’s exposure to market risk arises principally from customer-driven transactions and recognizes 
that the value of on and off-balance sheet positions of the bank are adversely affected by the movement 
in the market prices or rates such as interest rate, exchange rate, equity prices and commodity price 
that may result in loss for the bank. The objective of the Bank’s market risk policies and processes is to 
obtain the best balance between risk and return whilst meeting customers’ requirements.  
The Bank’s exposure to potential market risk arises mainly due to the open interest rate and exchange 
rate positions. All these elements are exposed to general and specific market movements and may 
result in the reduction of the value of a financial asset. The Asset and Liability Management Committee 
(ALCO) authorize the established limits and monitor results.
(a) Interest Rate Risk
The interest rate risk is the exposure of the financial position of the Bank to any losses arising from 
adverse movements in interest rates.
The Bank monitors the sensitivity of changes in interest rates, and determines the balance structure, 
different item terms and investment strategies.
The table below summarizes the exposure to interest rate risks. Included in the table below are the 
Bank’s assets and liabilities at carrying amounts, categorized by the earlier of contractual re-pricing 
or maturity dates.

(b) Exchange Rate Risk
Exchange rate risk is the risk a financial instrument’s value fluctuates as a result of changes in the 
exchange rates of foreign currencies and other financial variables. Foreign exchange rate risks arise 
from financial instruments denominated in currencies other than the Bank’s functional currency.
The Bank’s foreign currency denominated assets and liability accounts may result in translational gain/
loss depending on the net open position and direction of the exchange rate movement. To control the 
risk, the net position in each foreign currency is managed on a daily basis. 
The various foreign currencies to which the Bank is exposed to are summarized below:

Sensitivity Analysis
As can be witnessed in the exchange rate movement during the year, the tendency of further depreciation 
of Birr is expected. Hence, we have considered two senarios of Birr devaluation by 15% and 20%. In 
order to see the impact on the financial performance of CBE, the sensitivity is applied to the open 
position in USD, GBP and other currencies.

(d)  Operational Risk Management
Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss arising from a wide variety of causes associated 
with the Bank’s processes, personnel, technology and infrastructure and from external factors other 
than credit, market and liquidity risks such as those arising from legal and regulatory requirements 
and generally accepted standards of corporate behavior.
The Bank seeks to ensure that key operational risks are managed in a timely and effective manner 
through a framework of policies, procedures and tools to identify, assess, monitor, control and report 
such risks. 
Operational risks arise from all of the Bank’s operations and are faced by all business units. As such, 
the Bank seeks to ensure that key operational risks are managed in a timely and effective manner 
through a framework of policies, procedures and tools to identify, assess, control and report such risks.
The scope of operational risk assessment of any process shall be determined based on various factors 
among them:
• The level of perceived risks;
• Previous operational risk assessment risks;
• Business criticality of the activities, process or product under consideration;
• The presence of overarching regulatory requirement; and
Annual Report 2021/22 117

NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
(29)  FINANCIAL RISK REVIEW - (Continued)
(d)  Operational Risk Management  - (Continued)
 
• Management’s need for further examination of ongoing operations (such as lines of business, 
   product, service and processes individually or in combinations).
Every risk assessment unit shall perform a risk assessment on its respective processes/units, at least 
on an annual basis. The Risk and Compliance Management process may request for more frequent 
risk assessment, if the need arises, primarily based on the perceived level of risk of the respective risk 
assessment unit/process.
(e)  Capital Management
The National Bank of Ethiopia, has issued directive number SBB/4/95 that dictates every bank transfer 
on an annual basis, 25% of its annual net profit to its legal reserve account until such account equals its 
capital. When the legal reserve account equals the Bank’s capital, the amount to be transferred to the 
legal reserve account shall be 10% of the annual net profit.
The Bank’s capital is therefore managed in accordance with NBE directives and proclamation on banking 
business and those of subsidiaries capital is managed in accordance with the commercial code and 
other related laws.  
In addition to regulatory requirements, CBE conducts objective analysis on the adequacy of its 
capitalization on a regular basis. Based on the result of rigorous analysis made on capital management 
and adequacy, CBE injects additional capital after proposing the required amountof additional capital 
to the Ministry of Financeand upon approval by the house of peoples’ representatives of the Federal 
Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.
The National Bank of Ethiopia requires a bank to maintain at all times:
•  Primary or Tier 1 capital: state capital/paid-up capital, declared reserves and Accumulated Profit 
    or loss; and
•  Secondary or Tier 2 capital: Includes qualified equity instruments. However, CBE does not have any 
    tier-2 capital account in its statement of financial position.
The Bank and its individually regulated subsidiaries have met with all of the external capital requirements 
to which they are subject. As of 30 June 2022, and 30 June 2021 respectively, the Bank’s regulatory 
capital position was as follows:

(30)  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
(a) Accounting Classifications
Fair value of a price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal, or in its absence, 
the most advantageous market to which the Bank has access at that date. The fair value of a liability 
reflects its non-performance risk.
When applicable, the Bank measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active 
market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take 
place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
When there is no quoted price in an active market, the Bank uses valuation techniques that maximizes 
the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen 
valuation technique incorporates all the factors that market participants would take into account in 
pricing a transaction.
The following sets out the Bank’s basis of establishing fair values of financial instruments:
Investment securities with observable market prices including equity securities are fair valued using 
that information. Investment securities that do not have observable market data are fair valued using 
discounted cash flow method or quoted market prices for securities with similar yield characteristics. 
During the current year, there was sufficient information available to measure the fair value of 
financial instruments based on observable market inputs. In the previous year, the available-for-sale 
equity instruments were measured at cost because the fair value was not considered to be reliably 
measurable. 
Loans and advances to customers and Loans to micro-finance institutions are net of allowance for 
impairment. The estimated fair value of loans and advances represents the discounted amount of 
future cash flows expected to be received. Expected cash flows are discounted at current market rates 
to determine fair value hence their fair values approximate their carrying amounts.
The estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is the amount repayable on demand. 
Estimated fair value if fixed interest-bearing deposits without quoted market prices is based on 
discounting cash flows using the prevailing market rates for debts with similar maturities and interest 
rates, hence their fair value approximates their carrying amounts.

The Bank recognizes a lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at 
that date. The Bank uses an incremental borrowing rate that is based on the weighted average cost of 
deposits across the years. The rates used to compute the present values of buildings lease liabilities 
as at 30 June 2022 was 4.88%. The rates used to compute the land lease liabilities as at 30 June 2022 
was 9.00%.
The Bank leases buildings for its office space and branches. The building leases typically run for a 
period of between 2 and 10 years with majority of the contracts running for a period of 5 and 6 years. 
Some leases include an option to renew the lease for an additional period at the end of the contract 
term. The renewal term and lease rentals cannot be reliably estimated before the end of a contract.

iii. Actuarial Assumptions
The principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date are detailed below:
30 June 2022
30 June 2021
Discount rate
13.40%
12.90%
Salary increase rate
16.00%
15.00%
Gold increase rate
16.00%
16.00%
Long term medical inflation rate
13.00%
13.00%
Long term inflation rate
12.30%
10.50%
	
The assumed discount rates are derived from rates available on government bonds for which the timing 
and amounts of payments match the timing and the amounts of our projected pension payments.
iv. Sensitivity Analysis 
Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date, in any of the actuarial assumptions and assuming 
that all the other variables remain constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligations as of 
30 June 2022 by the amounts shown below:
2022
2021
Increase
Decrease
Increase
Decrease
Discount rate (0.5% variance)
(1,076,643,355) 1,346,427,614
(529,423,655)
624,662,413
Salary increase rate
(1.00% variance)
995,999,131
(830,393,372)
801,237,145
(668,045,722)
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other 
assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions 
may be correlated.
