. Annual Report 2013/14 9

PRESIDENT

| am very pleased and greatly honored
to announce to all stakeholders the
remarkable achievement of the
Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE)
during the 2013/14 fiscal year. The
gross profit of the Bank reached an
all-time high of Birr 9.9 billion for the
first time in its 72 years of existence.

The Ethiopian economy continues to
perform strongly for the tenth succes-
sive year, registering a 10.9% average
growth per annum, mainly supported
by the market-oriented agricultural
production, expanded local and
foreign investment in construction,
growth in agro-processing and manu-
facturing sector as well as large
public investments on infrastructure

and social services.

As the leading player in the domestic
banking industry, CBE has seized the

opportunities created by the favorable
economic growth in the country. The
total income of the Bank rose to Birr
17.8 billion in 2013/14, showing a Birr
4.1 billion (29.6%) increase over the
performance of the previous year. At
the end of the fiscal year, the total
asset of the Bank stood at Birr 244.1

billion, registering a growth rate of
25% compared with the preceding
year. Total deposit reached Birr 194.1
billion, a 25.7% growth over the per-
formance of the preceding year. On
the other hand, the overall expenses
of the Bank during the year under
review reached Birr 7.8 billion, show-
ing an increase of 51.9% over the pre-
vious year that is generally linked
with the rapid expansion of the Bank.

The CBE has demonstrated its com-

mitment to reaching out potentia
customers and the public by opening
137 additional branches across the
country during the year under review.
The opening of these branches no
only enabled the Bank to widen its

customer base, but also guaranteed

accessibility to the general public a
large.

With the launching of the core bank-
ing project, which went live in May
2012, many of the branches and other
units of the bank are connected, sub-
stantially contributing to improved
service delivery. This process will
continue in the coming years until all
operational units are fully connected

to the core banking technology. The
Bank has also expanded many tech-
nology based services, including
ATMs, POS, Mobile Banking and
Internet Banking services. These ser-
vices will continue to be expanded in
the years to come in line with the
objective of creating a cashless soci-

ety in Ethiopia.
At this occasion, | would like to thank
he Board of Directors for their vision-
ary leadership and CBE’s employees

or their commitment to achieving

such an outstanding result. | would
also like to express my appreciation

o the Bank customers in particular,
and the public in general, for their
priceless contributions to the opera-

ional success attained by the CBE
during the fiscal year 2013/14.

With the continued support of CBE’s
esteemed customers, visionary lead-
ership of the BoD and the commit-
ment of its staff, | am confident that
we will have no difficulty in realizing
our vision of becoming a world-class
commercial bank.

1. Global and Domestic Economic Highlights |
1.1. Global Economy

The global economy has started to strengthen since
he second half of 2013. Despite slowdown in recovery,
it is estimated to grow by 3.6% in 2014, from 3% in
2013, reflecting a recovery in some of the advanced
economies, particularly the US economy. Recovery of
he Euro-area remains weak. Developing and emerg-
ing economies, which have been contributing more
han two-thirds of the global growth, will continue to
register further growth in 2014. Sub-Saharan coun-
ries registered an impressive average growth of 4.9%
in 2013 and are expected to register 5.4% in 2014.
mprovement in the developed economies is expected
o be the driving force in stimulating the global
economy (IMF, July 2014).

The trends in global import and export commodities show that there has been consistent fluctuation
in volume and price, which affected the economic performance of both developing and advanced
economies. The volume of world trade grew by 3% in 2013, and this is expected to rise to 4.3% by the
end of 2014, mainly due to the growth in trade volume from emerging economies. The 2013 import

1.2. Ethiopian Economy

Economic growth in Ethiopia remained strong with the help of large investments in infrastructure and
expanded productive capacity in the energy sector. This solid growth has been inclusive and broad
based, benefiting both the urban and rural population. Growth for 2013/14 was an average of 10.9%
(MoFED, 2013/14], which is similar to the preceding year.

2. Financial Statement Analysis

2.1. Income Statement Analysis

The total income of the Bank for 2013/14 stood at Birr 17.8 billion, registering a growth of
29.6% when compared with the preceding year performance of Birr 13.7 billion. This resulted
because of the growth in both interest income and non-interest income. The income generated
from foreign banking operations was about Birr 5.3 billion, accounting for 29.7% of the total
income.

On the other hand, the total expense of the Bank stood at Birr 7.8 billion, showing an increase

of Birr 2.7 billion (51.9%) over the previous year Birr 5.2 billion. This is due to the rise in both
interest and non-interest expenses in connection with the business expansion of the Bank.

banks around the world. The overall income earned from foreign banking operations stood a

3.1. Human Resources

Cognizant of the fact that strengthening the human resources development is key to
organizational success, CBE continued to exert unreserved efforts towards strengthening its
human capacity through providing various on-and-off the job training and by recruiting
additional new and trained employees and retaining existing staff through devising various
incentives and benefit packages. The Bank recruited 3,905 permanent employees during the
year under review, and the total number of staff was raised to 18,524 during 2013/14 from
15,007 the preceding year.

With the objective of enhancing the expertise and professionalism of its employees to the
required level, a total of 15,478 employees participated in different managerial and technical
capacity enhancement training programs during the year. In addition to the in-house skill
upgrading training programs, the Bank sponsored several employees to attend
post-graduate studies.

As the success of the Bank highly depends on the quality of its human resources, CBE will
continue to give large emphasis on recruiting qualified professionals, training its staff, and
improving the benefit packages. By doing so, the Bank would ensure that its workforce is
equipped with the appropriate managerial and technical knowledge in the competitive and
dynamic business environment.

Annual Report 2013/14 19

Global technological advancement in information technologies towards service industry has
brought about vast opportunities. The effort of CBE to tap these opportunities has been
encouraging and crucial to transform the Bank. The recent performance of CBE shows that
he total cost of investment on IT hardware and software reached around Birr 568 million as
of June 2014. This balance was around Birr 415 million in the preceding year. As a result of
his investment, the number of ATMs and POS machines deployed increased. Most of the
Bank units were also connected to core banking, which went live in 2012, and helped to
mprove service delivery. Mobile and internet banking services had also expanded. These
efforts will continue in the years to come to make the Bank more competitive and win the
hearts and minds of its existing and potential customers.

The Bank opened 137 new branches during 2013/14 FY, bringing its total branch network to
832. Many of its existing branches also expanded their services by opening additional win-
dows. Consequently, the customer base grew significantly, reaching 8.2 million customers,
depicting an incremental of about 2 million during the fiscal year under review. Furthermore,
additional 183 ATMs and 38 points of sale (POS) machines were deployed across major cities
and business locations. Moreover, additional 673,292 visa cards were issued, and the number
of visa card holders reached 973,762 by June 30 2014.

Apart from increased accessibility, impressive progress was also registered during the fiscal
year with respect to introducing new products such as interest free banking, youth, and
women savings schemes. These products have been progressing well and contributed to the
overall deposit mobilization efforts of the Bank.

In the years to come, CBE will continue to expand its branch network, deploy more ATMs and
POS machines so that it should enhance convenience to its customers and further improve
its service delivery. By enhancing its service delivery and expanding its outreach, the Bank is
committed to maintaining its market share in addition to adding more values to its custom-
ers.

a) Statement of compliance

These financial staternents have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and in the
manner required by the Commercial Code of Ethiopia of 1960.

b) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis,
except for the measuremen of impaired assets at their fair values. Historical cost is
generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets.

The principal accounting policies are set out below.

c} Income
Income is recognized in the period in which it is earned. When a lending account becomes
non-performing, interest is suspended and excluded from income until it is received. However,
it is computed and shown ina memorandum account. Expense is recognized in the period in

which it is incurred.

d) Non- interest income

i) Dividend income
Dividend income is recognized when the Bank's right to receive a dividend as a share

holder is established.

ii) Rental income
Rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term.

iii) Other income

ransferred to the recipient and the amounts of revenue can be measured reliably.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
e) Treasury bills and government securities

Treasury bills and government securities bearing interest are stated at cost plus accrued
interest. Non-interest bearing securities are discounted using the effective interest rate

f] Coupon and corporate bonds
Coupon and corporate bonds are stated at cost.

g) Financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Bank becomes a party to
the contractual provisions of the instrument. They are initially measured at fair value.

Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reportin
period. Financial assets are considered to be impaired when there is objective rere tht
as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial
asset, the estimated future cash flows of the asset have been affected.

h) Other investments

Other investments are stated at cost. Income is recognized only to the extent that distributions
are received from net profits that have arisen subsequent to the date of acquisition.

i) Tangible assets
(i) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged on the straight-line basis at the following rates per annum.

| %
| Buildings 5

| Computers and software 25
| Fixtures, fittings and equipment 20
| Motor vehicles 20

ii) Capital work in progress

Capital work in progress is included under property, plant and equipment and

comprises costs incurred on ongoing capital works. These costs include material

COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

3: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

j) Goodwill

Goodwill arose in the acquisition of Bole Printing Enterprise during the year, because the
consideration paid exceeded the values of the tangible assets acquired.
Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at each year end.

) Leases

Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards incidental
o ownership of the leased item, are capitalized at the inception of the lease at the fair value
of the property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease
payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so
as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance
charges are reflected in profit or loss.

Leasehold land is presented separately on the face of the balance sheet and is stated at cost
ess accumulated amortization. The costs are amortized over the period of the leases.

) Taxation

ncome tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

i) Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from
profit reported in the profit and loss account because of items of income or expense that are
axable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The

Bank's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

ii) Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the
computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable
temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available
against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting
period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable
profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in
the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realized, based on tax rates and tax
legislation that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period.
The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities reflects the tax consequences
that would follow from the manner in which the Enterprise, as at the end of the reporting
period, expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of these assets and liabilities.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
m) Distribution of profits

The net profit of the Bank is distributed in accordance with Distribution of Profits of Public
Enterprises Council of Ministers Regulation No. 107/2004.

n) Leave accrual

Employees’ entitlements to annual leave are recognized when they accrue to employees. A
provision is made for the estimated Liability for annual leave at the reporting date.

o) Cash and cash equivalents

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on
hand and in banks and short term, highly liquid investments with maturity periods of three
months or less.

p) Translation of foreign currencies

Transactions in foreign currencies during the year are translated into Ethiopian Birr at the
exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency monetary assets and
liabilities are translated at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Resultant
exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss for the year. Non-monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currency are recorded at the exchange rate ruling at
the date of the transaction.

q) Trust funds
The Bank and its subsidiaries act as trustees and in other fiduciary capacities that result in

the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals, trusts, retirement benefit plans and
other institutions. Assets held in trust are not included in the consolidated balance sheet.

Nature of contingent Liabilities

Letters of credit commit the Bank to make payment to third parties, on production of
documents, which are subsequently reimbursed by the customers.

An acceptance is an undertaking by a bank to pay a bill of exchange drawn on acustomer. The
Bank expects most acceptances to be presented and reimbursement by the customer is
almost immediate.

Guarantees are generally written by a bank to support the performance by a customer to third
parties. The Bank will only be required to meet these obligations in the event of the
customers default.

35 RISK MANAGEMENT DISCLOSURES

This section provides details of the Group's exposure to risk and describes the methods
used by management to control risk. The most important types of financial risks to which
the Group is exposed are credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. Market risk includes
currency risk and interest rate risk.

A) Risks

i) Credit risk

The Group's credit exposure at the balance sheet date from financial instruments
held or issued for trading purposes is represented by the fair value of instruments
with a positive fair value at that date, as recorded on the balance sheet.

The risk that counter-parties to trading instruments might default on their obligations
is monitored on an ongoing basis. In monitoring credit risk exposure, consideration
is given to trading instruments with a positive fair value and to the volatility of the fair
value of trading instruments.

To manage the level of credit risk, the Group deals with counter-parties of good credit
standing, enters into master agreements whenever possible, and, when appropriate,
obtains collateral.

The Group also monitors concentrations of credit risk by industry and type of customer
in relation to the Group loans and advances to customers by carrying a balanced
portfolio. The Group has a significant exposure to individual customers or counterparties.

ii) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk arises in the general funding of the Group’s activities and in the
management of positions. It includes both the risk of being unable to fund assets at
appropriate maturities and rates and the risk of being unable to liquidate an asset at
a reasonable price and in an appropriate time frame.

The Group has access to a diverse funding base. Funds are raised mainly from
