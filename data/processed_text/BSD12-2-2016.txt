Dear Sir;
Subject: Repealing Circular No. BSD/12/2016

We recall that following the Credit Reference System (CRS) outage since May 04, 2016
we have issued Circular No. BSD/12/2016 dated May 19, 2016 by which we have
temporarily suspended the legal requirement set in article 8.1 of NBE Directives No.
CRB/01/201; allowing your bank to act at its own discretion regarding obtaining of credit
information for loan/new facility application processing.

With the coordinated efforts of NBE, the system vendor and other suppliers, the CRS is
now restored and it has been up and running smoothly since May 24, 2016.

As a result, Circular No, BSD/12/2016 is hereby repealed by this letter reinstating the
legal requirement set in article 8.1 of NBE Directives No CRB/01/2012 into force.
