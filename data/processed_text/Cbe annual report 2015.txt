Annual Report 2015/16 11

1. Global and Domestic Economic Highlights
1.1 Global Economy

Global output growth is estimated to have grown by
3.1% in 2016. Advanced economies grew by 1.8% and
the developing economies by 4.1%. Developing
economies faced stronger headwinds, due to weaker
growth among advanced economies and persistently
low commodity prices as well as reduced global trade
and capital flows (IMF, July 2016).

Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa remained weak at
1.6%, lower than the rate registered in 2015. However,
itis projected to pick up to 3.3% in 2017, helped by a
small rebound in commodity prices. Resource inten-
sive countries have suffered from the decline in commodity prices and the region's frontier markets
are adversely affected by tighter global financial conditions. The effect of a decline in oil prices for
oil-importing countries has been smaller than expected as many of these economies export other
nonrenewable resources whose prices have also dropped compared to the past.

In the past few years, world trade performance has been sluggish, mainly due to slow and uneven
recovery in major developed countries and moderate growth in developing countries. As a result,
world trade is estimated to have grown by 3.1% in 2016. Weak commodity prices, increased
exchange-rate volatility and economic slowdown in many emerging countries, including China,
continued to put downward pressures on trade flows. However, stronger demand in the United States
and Europe is likely to offset the downward pressures and contribute to global trade growth revival
in the coming year.

By and large, economic conditions remain challenging for commodity exporters, that continue to
struggle to adjust to the new era of low prices. In contrast, commodity importers show greater
resilience although the expected growth windfall from low energy prices has been modest due to low
prices of non-energy primary commodities exported by these countries.

1.2 Ethiopian Economy

Despite challenging macroeconomic and weather conditions, the Ethiopian economy has registered
8% growth in 2015/16. The real GDP growth was lower by 3.2% from the base case scenario set under
GTP Il target set for the fiscal year, although it was higher than the average growth estimated for
Sub-Saharan Africa (NBE, 2015/16).

In 2015/16, though agriculture still remained the dominant sector, it registered a slow growth rate of
2.3%, largely due to the contraction in grain crop production as a result of EL Nino. Moreover, its share
in GDP diminished to 36.7%, lower than the preceding year performance of 38.7% and the GTP Il
target of 37.5% for the fiscal year.

On the other hand, the industrial sector grew by 20.6% and constituted 16.7% of GDP. During the
fiscal year, the sector contributed 38.8% to the overall economic growth.

12 Commercial Bank of Ethiopia

The service sector continued to dominate the economy. The contribution of the sector to GDP growth
reached about 50%, implying that half of the country’s economic growth was the contribution of the
service sector.

Domestic saving increased by 20.1% and its ratio to GDP improved to 22.4% from 21.9% a year ago,
but slightly lower than the target. Similarily, total consumption expenditure increased by 17.1% in
2015/16. The annual average headline inflation was 9.7% during the fiscal year compared with the
7.7% of 2014/15, largely because of a 3.7% increase in food and non-alcoholic beverage prices.

The fiscal year under review witnessed poor performance in merchandise exports which dropped by
5% over the preceding year due to the decline of international commodity prices in some of the export
items. Similarly, net services receipts decreased by 161% due to the rise in outflows of construction
services. In contrast, net private transfers and public transfers grew by 18.6% and 3.2%, respectively.

The total merchandise import registered a growth of 1.6% owing to higher import bill of consumer
goods and semi-finished goods. As a result, Ethiopia's external sector performance exhibited a
widening deficit in its trade, current account (including official transfers], capital account and overall
balance of payments.

In general, Ethiopia has seen not only economic growth but also improvements in income inequality
and decline in poverty during the fiscal year. Per capita income increased to USD 794 from USD 725
a year ago; and poverty is estimated to have dropped to about 23%

Annual Report 2015/16 13

At the end of the fiscal year, the total income of CBE reached Birr 27.7 billion, up by 19.3%
from the preceding year performance of Birr 23.2 billion. This was mainly due to growth in
interest income. From the total income, foreign banking operations generated about Birr 5
billion, representing 18.1% of the total income.

The total expense of the bank amounted to about Birr 14 billion, depicting an increase of

32.9% over 2014/15. This is primarily due to the rise in both interest and non-interest
expenses.

Trends in Income Statement (Mn. Birr]

Trends in total income of CBE indicate a steady growth in the past five years, largely due to
a consistent growth in interest income.

2015/16, the bank recruited 6,168 new blood, bringing the total staff strength to 28,467 from
22,908 in the preceding year.

On the other hand, recognizing the importance of training and development, the bank has

and ethical training in the fiscal year being reviewed.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

| BANK INFORMATION

The Bank is established as a limited liability public enterprise in the Federal
Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.

The Bank's head office is in Addis Ababa and it has over 1,000 branches throughout
Ethiopia

It is wholly owned by the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.

2 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial staternents of the
Bank and two entities controlled by the Bank - its subsidiaries. Control is achieved
where the Bank has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

A 64.44% share in Universal Investors SC has not been consolidated, because
management is of the opinion that it is of little concern to the shareholder on account
of the small financial interests involved.

3 ACQUISITION OF A BUSINESS

The business of Construction and Business Bank Share Company, a company wholly
owned by the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, was
acquired by virtue of a Council of Ministers Regulation that transferred the rights and
obligations of the share company to the Bank with effect from 31 March 2016. The
assets and liabilities are recorded at the book values of the share company as at 31
arch 2016.

The share company was engaged in a similar banking business as the Bank.

In the nine months ended 31 March 2016, the share company earned interest income
of Birr 304,300,140 and a pre-tax profit of Birr 74,911,453. No separate earnings
figures for the three monthsended 30June 2016 are available, as management
considered that the benefits to be derived from such information would exceed the cost
of providing it.

rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalized at the
inception of the lease at the fair value of the property or, if lower, at the present
value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned
between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance

CANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Taxation

Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred
aX.

i} Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profits for the year. Taxable profits
differ from profits reported in the profit and loss account because of items of
income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that
are never taxable or deductible. The Bank’s liability for current tax, as well as that
of its subsidiaries, is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

ii) Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax
iabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred
ax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences to
he extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which
hose deductible temporary differences can be utilized.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each
reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable tha
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be
recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected
to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realized, based
on tax rates and tax legislation that have been enacted or substantially enacted
by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax assets and
liabilities reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in
which the Bank and its subsidiaries, as at the end of the reporting period, expec
to recover or settle the carrying amounts of these assets and liabilities.

parties. The Bank will only be required to meet these obligations in the event of the customer's
default.

RISK MANAGEMENT DISCLOSURES

This section provides details of the Group's exposure to risk and describes the methods
used by management to control risk. The most important types of financial risks to
which the Group is exposed are credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. Market risk
includes currency risk and interest rate risk.

a) Risks

i) Credit Risks

The Group's credit exposure at the balance sheet date from financial
instruments held or issued for trading purposes is represented by the fair
value of instruments with a positive fair value at that date, as recorded on
the balance sheet.

The risk that counter-parties to trading instruments might default on their
obligations is monitored on an ongoing basis. In monitoring credit risk
exposure, consideration is given to trading instruments with a positive fair
value and the volatility of the fair value of trading instruments.

To manage the level of credit risk, the Group deals with counter-parties of
good credit standing, enters into master agreements whenever possible,
and, when appropriate, obtains collateral.

The Group also monitors concentrations of credit risk by industry and type
of customer in relation to the Group loans and advances to customers by
carrying a balanced portfolio. The Group has a significant exposure to
individual customers or counterparties.

ii) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk arises in the general funding of the Group's activities and in
the management of positions. It includes both the risk of being unable to
fund assets at appropriate maturities and rates and the risk of being
unable to liquidate an asset at a reasonable price and in an appropriate
time frame.

COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

RISK MANAGEMENT DISCLOSURES (continued)

The Group has access to a diverse funding base. Funds are raised mainly from
deposits and capital. This enhances funding flexibility, limits dependence on any
one source of funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. The Group strives to
maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use
of liabilities with a range of maturities. The Group continually assesses liquidity
risk by identifying and monitoring changes in funding required to meet business
goals and targets set in terms of the overall Bank strategy.

In addition, the Group holds a portfolio of liquid assets as part to its liquidity risk
management strategy.

iii) Market risk

Interest rate risk

The Group's operations are subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuations
to the extent that interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities
mature or reprice at different times or in differing amounts. Risk management
activities are aimed at optimizing net interest income, given market
interest rates levels consistent with the Group's business strategies. The
Group does not have any significant interest rate risk exposures.

Currency risk

The Group is exposed to currency risk through transactions in foreign
currencies. The Group's transactional exposures give rise to foreign
currency gains and losses that are recognized in profit or loss. In respect
of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, the Group
ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying and
selling foreign currencies at spot rates when considered appropriate.

b) Risk measurement and control

Interest rate, currency, credit, liquidity and other risks are actively man-
aged by an independent risk control group to ensure compliance with the
Group's risk limits. The Group's risk limits are assessed regularly to
ensure their appropriateness given the Group's objectives and strategies
and current market conditions. A variety of techniques are used by the
Group in measuring the risks inherent in its trading and non-trading
positions.
