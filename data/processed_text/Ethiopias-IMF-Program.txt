The Ethiopian Government announced yesterday its intention to seek the 
support of the IMF as part of a nearly $3bn loan package to be disbursed over 
the next three years.  The agreement with the IMF is unambiguously positive, 
in our view, and will address head-on some of Ethiopia’s most pressing short-
term macro challenges (fx constraints and high inflation). While the details of 
the agreement are not yet publicly available and are likely to be released only 
after next week’s IMF Board meeting, we offer below some early observations. 
 
§ Background: The Ethiopian Government and the International Monetary 
Fund both issued press statements on December 11, 2019 announcing a 
staff-level agreement on a $2.9bn IMF lending program. The agreement 
follows an IMF staff visit that took place in November 2019, and is to be 
formally approved at an IMF Board meeting expected to take place on 
December 18, 2019. The agreement will represent the first time in a decade 
that Ethiopia is signing onto an IMF program; the last IMF loan to Ethiopia 
was in 2010 and outstanding debt owed to the Fund (reflecting many 
subsequent repayments) stood at only $38mn as of June 2019, equal to just 
0.1 percent of external debt and 0.04 percent of GDP.     
 
§ Exceptional support: At nearly $3bn, the level of support being committed 
to Ethiopia amounts to one of the highest levels of financial assistance that 
can possibly be provided under the IMF’s lending rules. IMF loans are 
determined by a country’s ‘quota’ which (simplifying) is dependent on the 
size of its economy and per capita income. Ethiopia’s quota at the IMF 
amounts to around $415mn and a lending package of $2.9bn is thus 
equivalent to 7 times Ethiopia’s quota (most IMF lending is normally limited 
to 3 times a country’s quota).  Based on our review of outstanding IMF 
lending data, the funding committed to Ethiopia will be by far the highest 
in Sub-Saharan Africa and well above recent Fund programs with countries 
such as Ghana ($918mn), Kenya ($509mn), and Cote d’Ivoire ($300mn). 
Indeed, seen in proportion to a country’s economic size (quota), the lending 
commitment to Ethiopia (at 700% of quota) is almost in the same league as 
exceptional IMF lending facilities provided over the past decade to 
countries such as Argentina (1000% of quota), Egypt (422% of quota), 
Ukraine (342% of quota), Ireland (300% of quota), and Portugal (188% of 
quota). The size of the financial package thus represents a very strong 
demonstration of support—to Ethiopia’s reformist government—from the 
IMF and its major shareholders.

§ Loan terms and modalities: As a combined ‘Extended Credit Facility’ (ECF) 
and ‘Extended Fund Facility’ (EFF), the IMF’s lending will be tapping into 
two credit lines that focus on medium-term external adjustment (with the 
former tailored to low-income countries and the latter generally utilized by 
middle-income countries). Based on the usual norms of such facilities, the 
credit will be provided over three years and be disbursed at six-monthly 
intervals subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions (see below). The 
terms of the IMF loan—based on ECF rates posted on the IMF website—are 
very favourable: interest rates of near zero percent, a grace period of 5.5 
years, and a repayment period of 10 years.   
 
§ Conditionality: As with all IMF programs, the lending comes with conditions 
covering both quantitative targets and qualitative reform measures—or 
‘performance criteria’ and ‘structural benchmarks’ in IMF jargon. Typical 
quantitative targets included in IMF programs are: (1) a ceiling on money 
supply growth; (2) a ceiling on government borrowing from the banking 
system; (3) a ceiling on arrears accumulation by the government; and (4) a 
floor (i.e. minimum level) on the central bank’s stock of foreign exchange 
reserves. We’d expect such performance criteria to feature in the Ethiopia’s 
IMF loan agreement, which is of course positive for helping secure macro 
stability: the cap on money supply ensures that it’s growth does not 
contribute to excessive inflation; the cap on domestic government 
borrowing helps limit the government’s use of local funding (thus avoiding 
a squeeze on private credit); the cap on arrears prevents an accumulation 
of unpaid liabilities to finance deficits; and the floor on fx reserves allows 
the exchange rate to better adjust to reflect market forces (as the central 
bank cannot indefinitely support an artificial rate if and when it faces a 
minimum reserves target). Structural benchmarks generally cover policy 
and regulatory reforms that have important macro consequences and, 
based on the IMF press release, these would appear targeted to include in 
Ethiopia’s case: (1) state enterprise reforms (likely covering those in the 
power, sugar, railway sectors); (2) central bank reforms; (3) financial sector 
reforms; and (4) revenue mobilization and public expenditure reforms.  
 
§ Alignment with Ethiopia’s economic policies: With the Ethiopian 
Government already having initiated (on its own) major macro and 
structural reforms since mid-2018, we don’t expect the set of measures in 
the IMF program to be radically different from the direction already taken 
with recent policies. Economic policies over the last two years have given 
high priority to prudent macro policies and to private sector led growth—
the clearest manifestation of which has been the 2019-20 budget (with a 
3% deficit and restrained borrowing), the privatization program, the launch 
of PPPs, extensive SOE reform, and wide-ranging initiatives to improve the 
ease of doing business. However, in at least two areas, the IMF program is 
likely to bring a more distinctive emphasis than has perhaps been the norm 
so far: (1) inflation control should be expected to be given higher urgency

3 
and attention; and (2) exchange rate flexibility is also likely to be more 
clearly prioritized to ensure the Birr is more reflective of its market rate. 
But even in these areas, we would not expect major departures from recent 
policy directions but rather incremental adjustments: monetary growth 
was not that excessive over the past two years and thus probably requires 
only a modest tightening to support disinflation, while exchange rate policy 
(already being modified since early November) will show a stepped-up pace 
of adjustment over the coming months but no sharp devaluations, in our 
view.  
 
§ Use of IMF funds: Unlike loans from the World Bank or other multilateral 
lenders, IMF funding provides fx resources that go to the central bank and 
not to the government budget. Thus, the IMF’s support will not provide 
new additional fiscal resources but rather make available fx resources to 
cover routine government imports and other general uses of fx funds within 
the broader economy. Funds are deposited into the central bank, 
contributing to an immediate jump in reported fx reserves, and those funds 
are gradually drawn down as the government uses fx funds for its outlays 
on (its own) imports, debt service, or other public sector payments. Central 
banks may choose to sell some portion of the new fx reserve stock to 
commercial banks (to boost the latter’s fx supplies), but we would not 
expect such sales in any substantial amounts as Ethiopia’s central bank has 
not—other than a few exceptional times—traditionally provided fx funds 
to Ethiopia’s private banks (who instead secure fx funds from their own 
exporting clients and from remittance and foreign investment flows that 
are channelled through their respective banks).  
 
§ Impacts: The IMF program will have its greatest impact in: (1) ensuring 
continued fiscal and monetary discipline in macro policy-making; (2) 
sending a very positive signal to external lenders; (3) helping attract foreign 
investors who had—thus far—been reluctant to invest in Ethiopia due to its 
fx policies; and (4) potentially addressing (once and for all) the chronic fx 
shortages—and many associated distortions—seen within the local 
economy in recent years. With a stronger macro framework being put in 
place, increased financial support from multilateral lenders (World Bank, 
African Development Bank, EIB) should be one of the most immediate 
positive impacts—thus providing additional resources from funders for the 
full range of activities supported by budgetary spending. Improved 
assessments by external rating agencies are also possible in the near-term. 
The gradual move of the Birr to a more realistic level should address long-
standing constraints in this area and work to boost (over the medium-to-
longer term) foreign investment flows as previously reluctant foreign 
investors are convinced to take a second look at Ethiopia. Within the 
domestic economy, we expect local banks could be somewhat affected by 
tighter monetary conditions (thus likely facing reduced credit growth and 
interest income), but could potentially benefit from a possible removal of

4 
the 30 percent mandatory surrender requirement on their monthly fx 
inflows if the NBE believes its enhanced reserve position is now strong 
enough to consider lifting this requirement. Over the medium-term, the 
local private sector overall should expect to see lower inflation, shorter fx 
waiting times, much improved fx access (though of course at a higher price), 
and more durable investment and growth prospects. 
 
§ Risks: IMF programs across the globe have brought significantly positive 
economic turnarounds in many instances but have also, in some cases, left 
unaddressed major pre-existing economic imbalances and crises. The IMF’s 
reviews of its own past programs suggest that the determinant of 
successful programs has often been linked to the level of commitment by 
policy-makers, the degree of program implementation, the extent of 
parallel support that is generated from other financiers (donors, lenders, 
private investors), and the exogenous conditions at the time of the program 
(e.g. global prices). In Ethiopia’s case, the policy commitment and readiness 
to reform is high, exogenous conditions currently look good (improving 
global growth, stable commodity prices), but notable risks include the 
upcoming political transition and potentially related domestic shocks.  
 
Overall, Ethiopia’s macro outlook is—in our view—now considerably 
brighter with the support of an IMF program. We expect to modify our near-
term economic projections, but would await the details of the macro 
framework agreement (to be released on the IMF website soon after the Board 
meeting) before such an undertaking. The start of an IMF program reinforces 
our medium-term expectations of continued strong growth, improving debt 
ratios, declining inflation, and rising fx reserves—but the pace of disinflation 
should be somewhat faster, the rise in fx reserves more rapid, and the rate of 
exchange rate adjustment likely larger.  For the current fiscal year, we expect 
the most notable changes will be seen in modestly slower monetary growth 
(likely to be held below 20 percent, with implications for credit growth), higher 
year-end fx reserves (potentially reaching $5bn by June 2020 if privatization 
proceeds are also received by then), and a more competitive exchange rate (a 
slightly weaker rate is now much more likely compared to the 32.8 Birr/USD 
we had recently forecast for June 2020). Inflation for the coming six months is 
unlikely to be that much different from our recent expectations, given its 
underlying sources (mostly due to food supply shocks in our view) and 
considering also the lag times involved for any new monetary policy actions to 
begin having an impact on prices. Considering a longer-term horizon, namely 
2021 and beyond, our expectations for key fx sources (exports, grants, loans, 
and FDI) would  be notably higher, while prospects for other macro variables 
such as inflation, private investment, and growth will also look much better.  
All things considered, if Ethiopia can complete its mid-2020 political transition 
in a smooth manner, macroeconomic conditions in the second half of 2020 
should be the best that the country has seen in many years.
