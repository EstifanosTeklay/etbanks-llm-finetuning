Message of the President
The 2012/13 fiscal year has been the year the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia had maintained
its continued excellence in its business growth and profitability, which I am greatly pleased
to announce to all stakeholders and the general public. As a result, the gross profit of the
Bank reached 8.6 billion Birr, up by 7.9 percent over the preceding fiscal year.
This unprecedented level of profit is registered owing to the robust macroeconomic
performance of the Ethiopian economy
and seizing the opportunity it provided.
Accordingly, the total income of the Bank reached Birr 13.7 billion, up by Birr 2.2 billion
(18.6%) compared with the performance of the previous year. At the end of the fiscal year,
the total assets of the Bank stood at Birr 195.4 billion, while total deposit reached 154.4
billion Birr, thus reflecting a 28.7 percent growth over the preceding year.
On the other hand, the overall expense of the Bank has reached Birr 5.2 billion, showing an
increase of 41.8 percent mainly due to the substantial increase in interest expense (42.0%)
followed by general expense (32.9%). The latter’s increase is attributable to branch
expansion.
The Bank’s commitment to promote financial inclusion is unparalleled by any other bank in
the industry which has been demonstrated by reaching out to large potential customers and
the public through opening 148 additional branches across the country during 2012/13 FY.
This brought the total branch network across the nation to 695, as of June 2013. The
opening of these branches enabled the bank to widen its customer base, which brought the
total number of accounts to about 6.2 million and scale up its deposit mobilization efforts.
Achieving service excellence and high business growth remained to be the key objectives of
the CBE in the year under review. To this end, the CBE has continued to implement two
major projects crucial for transforming its service delivery and overall performance. These
are Information Technology (IT) and Human Resources Development (HRD) projects. With
regard to the IT projects, card banking and CORE banking solutions components have
successfully been implemented and transferred to the relevant IS and E-payment sub
processes. Additional 200 branches and 4 head office organs have gone live with the T-24
CORE banking system, making the total branches and head office organs interfaced with the
9
system to 309. In the 2013/14 fiscal year, more branches and head office organs will go live
and other projects such as implementation of ERP, customizing the T-24 to provide interest
free banking, and instituting customer contact center will be undertaken.
Implementation of the
Human Resource Development
Strategy
is underway. The
recommendations are being implemented under five action areas: provision of technical
assistance to implement the strategy; putting succession planning system in place;
improving engagement and retention; introducing performance management system; and
training and system development. While some of the recommendations have been finalized
which include restructuring HRM; provision of developmental training for top management
and Board of Directors(BOD); and engagement and retention survey, others such as staffing;
succession planning scheme; and employee performance management system are underway.
In the 2013/14 fiscal year, implementation of the HRD activities that are underway will be
hastened and finalized.
On the whole, 2012/13 FY was a very successful year for the CBE. The key drivers of this
success were, as always have been, our customers who preferred to banking with us. I
would, therefore, like to extend my deepest appreciation and gratitude to our esteemed
customers.
I would also like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the BOD of the CBE for the
visionary leadership they provided and the employees of the Bank for their continued
commitment and dedication.
I have no doubt, with continued loyalty of our esteemed customers, visionary leadership
from BOD and staff commitment to achieve far better results, we continue to be people’s
chosen bank in the forthcoming years and realize our vision of becoming a world-class
commercial bank by year 2025.

1. Macroeconomic Highlights
1.1.
Global Economy
The world economic growth moves with a slow shift, averaging only 2.5 percent during the
first half of 2013, which is about the same pace as in the second half of 2012.  Advanced
economies are gradually growing and strengthening while emerging market economies face
the dual challenges of slow growth and tighter financial conditions. Growth rates of these
emerging economies are projected to remain much above those of the advanced economies
but below the elevated levels seen in recent years (WEO, October 2013).
The October 2013 report of IMF’s WEO shows that the world output growth has further
decreased by 0.3 percent compared with July 2013 WEO update. Output in advanced
economies is expected to expand by 2 percent in 2014, which is about ¾ percentage points
more than in 2013. Growth in the euro area will be held back by the very weak economies in
the periphery. Emerging market and developing economies are projected to expand by 5
percent in 2014, as fiscal policy is forecasted to stay broadly neutral and real interest rates
to remain relatively low.
It is possible to conclude that the recovery from the world economic crisis continues even if
the rate is too slow. The focus at this time is on emerging market economies which are on
the challenge of slower growth and tighter financial conditions triggered by U.S. monetary
policy.
1.2 The Ethiopian Economy
The Ethiopian economy grew by 8.5% in 2012/13 FY.  This growth is respectable in many
ways; particularly viewed in the context of faltering global economic conditions discussed
above. This fact is clear when compared with a much lower growth rate (5.3%) registered in
SSA countries and the minimum growth rate (7%) set for achieving MDG targets.1
An important aspect of this sustained growth is its trickling down effect on the life of the
public in alleviating poverty through improved access to education, health facility, and
1 MoFED, Budget speech to the House of Representatives for the 2012/13 fiscal year.
11
infrastructural development, etc. This improvement is discernible from the decline in the
proportion of the people who were below poverty line from 38.7 percent in 2005 to 29.6
percent in 2011 and estimated to have dropped to 27.6 percent in 2012 (MoFED, June 2013).
Inflation has dropped to single digit (7.4%), year on year, in June 2013 compared to 20.8
percent recorded in June 2012 (CSA)2. This deceleration in price level was attributed to
tight monetary policy and cautious execution of the government budget (IMF, MoFED)3.
Despite some challenges, the Ethiopian economy has performed well which had positively
impacted the financial sector in the year under review. The CBE could manage to exploit
the opportunity thereof and had registered good performance as well.
2. Highlights of the CBE
2.1. Financial Position
The CBE’s financial position kept strengthening over the years as a result of steady increase
in its income. The total income of the Bank for the year under review has jumped by 18.6
percent from Birr 11.6 billion to Birr 13.7 billion as of June 2012/13.
2.1.1 Net Interest Income
The net-interest income of the Bank rose to Birr 7.2 billion in 2012/13, up by 42.4 percent
from the 5.03 billion Birr in 2011/12.
The aggregate interest income grew by the same rate as net-interest income (42.3%) to Birr
9.5 billion in 2012/13. This high growth was largely attributed to increase in the overall
disbursement of loans and advances.
Interest expense also increased by birr 703.3 million owing to the large expansion in the
deposit base of the bank, including interest bearing deposits.

2.1.2 Net Interest Margin
Net interest margin shows how successful a firm’s investment decision is in relation to its
debt situation. A positive net interest margin implies that a firm’s investment decision is
good. Accordingly, a positive net interest margin of 4.7 percent is registered for the
2012/13 fiscal year.

2.1.3. Non–Interest Income
Non-interest income had accounted for about 30.5 percent of the total income. During the
year under review, total non-interest income was Birr 4.2 billion, compared with the
previous year (4.9 billion); it showed a 14.0 percent decline. This may be attributable to the
increase in the coverage of T-24 CORE banking solution to more branches and the
subsequent decline in the commission income from LMTS and a reduction in service charge
from outward remittance. Nevertheless, non-interest income continued to contribute
considerably to the total income of the Bank; implying the bank’s effort in diversifying its
income source.
13
2.1.4 Total Expenses
The total expenses of the Bank reached Birr 5.2 billion, surged by 41.8 percent compared
with the level in the preceding fiscal year. Interest expense accounted for the major share
of the increase in total expense (42.0%). This may be attributable to the increase in interest
bearing deposit.
2.1.5 Operating Profit
The total income of the Bank for 2012/13 stood at Birr 13.7 billion, registering a growth of
18.6 percent compared with Birr 11.6 billion in the preceding year. This growth in total
income is attributable to a 42.3 percent growth in interest income. However, it has grown
by a lesser margin than it was in the preceding year. On the other hand, total expenses
have surged by 41.8 percent to reach 5.2 billion from 3.6 billion in 2011/12, largely due to
the 42.0 percent increase in interest expense. The operating profit of the Bank has
maintained its upward trajectory successively over the past several years to reach Birr 8.6
billion in 2012/13. While this is a jump by a whooping margin from trend, it has increased
only by 7.9 percent from the preceding year. The net profit of the Bank stood at about Birr
5.9 billion, showing an increase by 7.9 percent against the previous fiscal year.
14
2.1.6 Earning Capacity
Despite a slight decline compared with the preceding year a performance levels of 4.8
percent and 101.2 percent for RoA and RoE, respectively in the 2012/13 fiscal year are high
from the standard. This implies the continued robust profitability of the Bank.
15
2.2. Balance Sheet Analysis
2.2.1 Asset Structure
The total asset of the Bank grew by 23.0 percent, and reached Birr 195.4 billion during the
fiscal year under review. The major account categories that pushed the asset balance up
were loans and advances to customers, investments as well as property and equipment.
2.2.2 Loan Portfolio
At the end of the fiscal year, the total outstanding loans and advances of the Bank rose by
21.1 percent, reaching 149.0 billion Birr. Outstanding loans to customers grew by about 20.6
percent.

The amount of fresh loans disbursed to the various economic sectors during the reporting
year was Birr 56.5 billion. This amount represents a 7.2 percent decrease compared with
the level in the preceding year. This shortfall is attributable to underutilization or non
utilization of disbursement commitment from some corporate entities and pre-shipment.

The total loan collection, on the other hand, reached Birr 38.8 billion, showing an increase
of 89.3 percent over the preceding fiscal year. Despite a slight increase compared with the
preceding year, the Bank managed to contain its NPL level below 5 percent (standard) at 2.2
percent.

2.2.3 Liabilities
The reviewing year saw a 23.2 percent rise in liabilities compared to the level in the
preceding year, which has reached Birr 186.2 billion. This increase is accounted by 32.1
percent increment in customers’ deposit and 8.8 percent increase in tax liability. The
opening of 148 additional branches, which helped to broaden the Bank’s outreach, is the
driving force behind the increase in deposit level coupled with the favorable business
environment in helping the Bank to command on a large deposit base. As a result, the
Bank’s total deposit reached Birr 154.4 billion in 2012/13 fiscal year, registering a growth
of 28.7 percent compared with that of the preceding year.  This level of deposit was not
only the highest in the Bank’s history, but it was instrumental in sustaining its lion’s market
share in the industry.
Demand deposit has increased by 30.6 percent compared with the level in the preceding
fiscal year. Similarly, savings deposit grew by 26.9 percent to reach Birr 53.4 billion, and
fixed time deposit by 18.6 percent to reach Birr 8.8 billion. The ratio of demand deposits
to total deposit stood at 60 percent, slightly larger than the level in the preceding year of
58.8 percent.  On the other hand, the share of savings and fixed time deposit were 34.6
percent and 5.7 percent, respectively.
17
Ownership wise disaggregation of deposit indicates that the bulk of the total deposit is
accounted by the private sector (53.1%), which is the main driver in sustaining the Bank’s
liquidity base.

2.2.4 Capital Adequacy
CBE’s capital and reserve increased from Birr 7.6 billion in 2011/12 to Birr 9.0 billion in
2012/13.
The risk weighted capital adequacy ratio stood at 13.3 percent, showing
improvement over the preceding fiscal year level of 9.68 percent.
The growth in capital
and reserve further reflects the Bank’s continued financial strength.
2.3. International Banking
International Banking operation is one of the core business areas where the CBE earns its
significant income and profit. This is so because the CBE had forged healthy business
relationship with many prominent banks around the world. The overall income earned from
foreign banking operations stood at Birr 4.0 billion, an improvement (5.5%) from the
preceding year of Birr 3.8 billion.
18
2.3.1 Foreign currency earnings
Foreign currency mobilization is one crucial components of the overall resource mobilization
strategy the CBE has devised. Accordingly, the total foreign currency inflow (excluding
purchase and intervention fund from NBE) during the year under review had reached USD
4.8 billion.

On the other hand, the total foreign currency earned from private transfer had substantially
surpassed the previous year same period (by 35.2 percent) the major reason being the
expansion of branch network of the bank and parallel launching of Western union, Money
Gram, and Xpress Money transfer services to more branches of the bank during the review
period.
2.4. Human Resources
The human resource development strategy, which has been developed by Frankfurt School
of Finance and Management, is continued to be implemented during the year under review.
Accordingly, five work plans have been drawn to implement recommended strategic actions
including; technical assistance to implement the strategy, succession planning system;
engagement and retention; performance management system and training and system
development. While some of the components of the strategic actions have been carried out,
others are underway and will continue to be implemented in the 2013/14 fiscal year.
In addition, the CBE has continued its efforts towards strengthening its human capacity by
providing various on-the –job and off-the-job training, recruiting additional new and trained
employees as well as retaining existing staff through devising different incentives and
benefit packages. Accordingly, a total of 13,912 employees were provided technical and
developmental training programs by both in house and external trainers and formal and
informal. Similarly, the bank continued to give special emphasis on recruiting qualified
professionals. In the reporting period, net recruitment of 2,235 permanent employees was
made raising employee strength to 15,007 by the end of the Fiscal year.
2.5. Business Development
The 2012/13 FY saw the opening of additional 148 branches, bringing CBE’s branch network
to 695.
Many of its existing branches also expanded their services by opening additional
windows. Consequently, the customer base grew significantly, reaching 6.2 million (in terms
of number of accounts) at the end of June 2013.  In addition, 300 ATMs and 231 point of sale
(POS) machines were deployed across major towns and business locations.
Moreover, the
number of card holders had reached 300,470 including the additional 239,416 VISA and ATM
cards delivered in the reporting year as of the same period.
20
Apart from increased accessibility, impressive progress was also registered during the fiscal
year with respect to the IT projects such as card banking and integrated core banking
solutions, and the installation of infrastructures. The T-24 CORE banking solution which
went live in May 2012 is rolled out to 305 branches (200 in the reporting year) and 4 head
office organs as of June 30, 2013. Mobile alerts, mobile and internet banking modules have
been finalized and started operation; procurement of 400 routers for roll-out of additional
branches had been finalized; GX report module finalized and implemented; T-24 system
management and mobile and internet banking are transferred to IS and E-payment sub
processes.
In addition to its existing products, CBE will enhance financial inclusion by introducing
interest free banking services and additional youth and women savings schemes in 2013/14
fiscal year. Moreover, it will continue to expand its outreach in terms of branch opening and
deployment of ATM and POS machines. By doing so the CBE will expand its customer base,
which is critical in maintaining its market share and improving service excellence.
