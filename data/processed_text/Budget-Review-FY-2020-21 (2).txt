This note reviews the recently passed Government Budget for the 2020-21 fiscal 
year. Notable aspects of the budget include: (1) the Government’s expectations 
of still-strong growth this year (8.5% for GDP, 4.5% for imports); (2) the planned 
20% increase in tax revenue, supported in part by higher indirect taxes (e.g. 
excises); and (3) the substantial spending increases/allocations dedicated for 
roads, health, education, debt service, irrigation, and security. With regards to 
the budget deficit, though a record Birr 126bn ($3.6bn) of government 
borrowing is planned this year, we find that Ethiopia will still show the lowest 
post-Corona budget deficit—relative to GDP—among Africa’s 10 largest 
economies; however, we expect the surge in domestic borrowing will bring 
higher interest rates to the Treasury Bill market over the course of the year. 
 
§ New Budget: The Ethiopian Parliament approved on July 7, 2020 a federal 
government budget with planned expenditure of Birr 476bn (12% of GDP) for 
the 2020-21 fiscal year (Table 1). Around 75 percent of government spending 
is to be covered by revenue and grants (Birr 305bn in revenue and Birr 46bn 
in grants), while roughly a quarter of total expenditure (Birr 126bn or 3.1% 
GDP) will require new borrowing from foreign and domestic lenders.  
 
§ Assumptions: The Budget assumes 8.5 percent GDP growth (which would 
make Ethiopia’s economy among the world’s fastest growing), inflation of 9.8 
percent, revenue growth of 20 percent, and import growth (critical for 
customs receipts) of 4.5 percent. These projections are not unrealistic, in our 
view, though we expect somewhat slower growth and higher inflation—thus 
leaving the budget assumptions close to our nominal GDP expectations.  
 
§ Financing: Of the total Birr 126bn needed to cover the budget deficit, Birr 
48bn ($1.3bn) is to be met by foreign borrowing. For the remaining Birr 78bn, 
a mix of domestic borrowing (from the central bank, commercial banks, and 
pension funds) and exceptional, one-off sources (e.g privatization) is to be 
utilized; the precise mix among these four financing sources is not fully 
specified and somewhat uncertain.  Even if the deficit were covered solely by 
new borrowing (with no use of privatization proceeds), we don’t expect debt 
ratios to deteriorate this year given strong growth in nominal GDP.  
 
§ Policy priorities: The combination of high allocations for growth-promoting 
public investments (roads, education, health, irrigation, security) alongside 
only a modest deficit deterioration relative to GDP (especially in a post-
COVID, cross-country context) reveals a policy stance that is clearly sensitive 
to macro stability concerns while still firmly developmental in its orientation.

Revenue assumptions and outlook 
 
§ 
Trends and Growth:  Revenue this year is projected to rise by around 20 
percent vs last year’s budget targets (Birr 350 vs Birr 290bn), propelled 
in part by a near 20 percent expansion in nominal GDP (8.5% real growth, 
9.8% year-average inflation) (Table 2).1 The Corona-related slowdown in 
certain sub-sectors will certainly impact revenue performance for the 
first half of the fiscal year and thus limit tax collections from business 
profits and import taxes; however, as we’ve noted before, the sub-
sectors most affected by the Corona pandemic are not a very large share 
of GDP and some of the anticipated impacts (in exports, industrial park 
activity, etc) have not been as severe as initially feared. Moreover, tax 
policy changes such as increased rates on excise taxes (see Appendix 1) 
as well as continued tax administration measures (including a recent 
amnesty that’s likely to bring businesses back into the tax net) will also 
contribute to the anticipated revenue growth. Perhaps most important, 
the on-going  depreciation of 15-20 percent on a year-on-year basis will 
boost the Birr value of many fx-denominated revenue sources including 
trade taxes (customs duty, import VAT, excise tax, and import surtaxes) 
as well as external grants (of which $1.3bn is anticipated for the fiscal 
year).2 Considering all of the above, and given that the assumed revenue 
increase is roughly in line with nominal GDP (both around 20 percent), 
the revenue targets appear reasonable and realistic in our view.  
 
Spending allocations and composition  
 
§ 
Trends and Growth:  The spending increase planned for the new fiscal 
year amounts to a 23 percent rise in nominal terms from last year’s 
budget figure (Birr 476bn vs Birr 387bn) (Table 3). In real terms, the 
planned expenditure for this year will amount to a modest 3 percent 
increase, reversing last year’s real decline in government expenditure. 
 
§ 
Budget expenditure: Per the classifications of the federal budget 
document, Ethiopia’s total government spending of Birr 476bn  is split 
across four categories: (1) current spending; (2) capital spending; (3) 
subsidies to regions; and (4) support for the Sustainable Development 
Goals or SDGs. The first two items, collectively amounting to Birr 294bn, 
are items spent directly by the federal government and can be further 
broken down into the following main federally administered spending 
items (Tables 4 and 5):  
 
1 We think it may be more realistic to expect real GDP growth of 6 percent this fiscal year alongside inflation of around 12-14 
percent on a year-average basis; though based on a different composition, this still leads to similar growth in nominal GDP (~20%) 
as used in the budget and thus a nominal GDP level of Birr 4.08 trillion for this fiscal year versus Birr 3.43 trillion last year. 
2 An estimated 40 percent of ‘Revenue & Grants’ is linked to the exchange rate and thus tends to rise in line with the rate of 
depreciation. This reflects the large role of grants (Birr 26bn budgeted last year) and trade taxes (Birr 102bn last year), relative to 
total budgeted revenue and grants of Birr 299bn last year.

§ 
Roads constitute the largest federal government spending item, 
with Birr 58.8bn being allocated this year for a total of 284 new 
roads, 72 road rehabilitations, and 5 new bridges.  
§ 
Education holds the second highest spending allocation, at Birr 
56.8bn, with funding in this line-item allocated to 47 federally-
administered universities for an average allocation of around 
Birr 1.2 billion per university. 
§ 
Debt service: Allocations to cover external as well as internal 
debt are the budget’s third largest spending item at Birr 37bn, 
indicative of the cumulative impact of deficit-related borrowing 
over the past decade; the largest component of this line-item 
(Birr22bn) covers repayments on external debt. 
§ 
Health is the fourth largest budget item, at Birr 18.7bn, which is 
a significant 46 percent increase (COVID-related) from last year. 
§ 
Defence has been allocated Birr 16.5bn this fiscal year, 5th largest 
overall and up 10 percent from last year’s levels.  
§ 
Two 
economic 
sectors—irrigation 
development 
and 
agriculture/rural development—have the 6th and 7th largest 
budgetary allocations, with funds dedicated to specific new 
projects in those fields as well as for the implementing agencies 
and institutes in these productive sectors. 
§ 
Justice and Security: At Birr 10.4bn and up 29 percent from last 
year, security and justice related allocations make up the 9th 
largest government expenditure item, roughly in line with its 
relative ranking in recent years. 
§ 
General Government Services and Organs of State: These 
administrative and federal institutions deliver key state 
functions and received the 8th and 10th largest allocations in the  
budget, or Birr 20bn taken collectively. Notable institutions 
include federal ministries, agencies, commissions as well as 
Parliament  and the Offices of the President and Prime Minister.  
 
• 
Spending shifts and priorities: Relative to spending levels from two 
years ago, federal government budgeted expenditure is up 43 
percent overall, from Birr 205bn to 294bn. Within this overall 
increase, the following sub-components have exceeded the average 
growth in federal expenditure, pointing to shifts in policy 
preferences towards these specific areas (Table 6): 
 
o Water Resources & Energy: Up 74%, or Birr 12.3bn to 21.5bn  
o Health: Up 73% from Birr 10.8bn to 18.7bn, reflecting 
particularly COVID-19 related increases this year.  
o Debt service: Up 64% from Birr 22.5bn to 36.9bn, reflecting 
rising debt and commitments to avoid arrears. 
o Justice and Security: Up 54% from Birr 6.8bn to 10.4bn. 
o Roads: Up 51% from Birr 38.9bn to 58.8bn.

Budget deficit and its financing 
 
The planned deficit of near Birr 126bn is a record high in nominal terms but, 
at 3.1 percent of GDP, is not substantially above deficit ratios seen in recent 
years. Indeed, relative to GDP, a deficit of 3.1 percent is similar to the 
average budget deficit outturn over the past five years (3 percent of GDP)  
and not much above the ten-year average (2.4 percent of GDP) (Table 7). 
Moreover, viewed from a cross-country perspective, and at a time when 
countries across the globe are showing a significant deterioration in budget 
deficits to combat COVID-19, we find that Ethiopia’s deficit this year will be 
the lowest—relative to GDP—among Africa’s 10 largest economies (Table 8).    
 
The external borrowing planned to cover the deficit is on the order of 
$1.3bn or Birr 48bn. Per the budget document, the largest sources of 
external funding are the World Bank, the African Development Bank, China 
Exim Bank and a few other lenders. To the extent that potential delays or 
shortfalls are encountered in these anticipated foreign loans (such as the 
apparent hold on recent World Bank funding), the overall external funding 
envelope may fall short of the budgeted figures. Such shortfalls are typically 
addressed by holding back on similar/corresponding expenditure items in the 
budget, which will prevent any worsening of the deficit but of course at the 
cost of cutbacks to affected programs.    
 
Assuming the planned external borrowing target is met, an additional Birr 
78bn of funding is still required and anticipated from a combination of 
domestic borrowing and exceptional privatization related inflows. Were 
this amount to be covered solely by domestic financing, the implied Birr 78bn 
of new borrowing would be the highest ever domestic financing usage over 
the past 20 years (Birr 78bn vs a previous peak of Birr 59bn in 2017-18). 
Relative to GDP, the domestic borrowing requirement of near 2.0 percent of 
GDP this year would be notably higher than the 1.3 percent of GDP average 
seen over the past 20 years (see Appendix 2).  Whether the large increase in 
domestic borrowing can be accommodated depends on trends in three 
major domestic financing sources (Table 9):  
 
• 
Commercial banks: The commercial banking system (including CBE) 
held Birr 1,043 bn in deposits as of June 2020, or a 16 percent growth 
from year-ago levels.  With similar (or slightly lower) growth likely for 
the new year, deposit levels should reach close to Birr 1,200bn by 
end-June 2021, implying that the Birr 78bn in government borrowing 
would be equivalent to around 7 percent of outstanding bank 
deposits. Relative to the incremental deposit growth for the fiscal 
year (Birr 147bn), however, the government’s financing need is 
equivalent of 50 percent of new bank deposits—a significant 
crowding out of funds (for the private sector) were the government 
to rely primarily on bank deposits for fulfilling its domestic borrowing

5 
requirement. Under Ethiopia’s current set of financing tools and 
instruments, bank deposits are channelled to government lending 
via banks’ participation in the Treasury Bill Market or through direct 
lending by CBE to the Federal Government. 
 
• 
Central bank credit: Based on MOFEC debt data, government 
borrowing from the central bank amounted to Birr 212 bn as of end-
2019, comprised mostly of direct advances from the NBE to the 
government (Table 9). Were the full Birr 78bn in new domestic 
financing secured solely from the central bank (a very inflationary 
form of deficit financing), this would imply a 36 percent growth in 
the rate of central bank lending to the government—a high rate of 
growth whether seen in nominal or real terms.  
 
• 
Non-bank funding (Pension Funds): Government borrowing via T-
Bills issued to non-banks (mainly to pension funds) amounted to Birr 
153bn as of end-2019, and Birr 78bn in new borrowing would imply 
a 50 percent increase from the recent outstanding stock. Annual net 
new purchases of T-Bills by pension funds were in the range of Birr 
15- 20bn in recent years, implying that at most one quarter of the 
budget’s domestic borrowing requirement would be covered if 
relying solely on incremental pension fund assets.  
 
• 
Privatization (exceptional financing): Given the progress now taking 
place in the Government’s privatization program, especially in the 
telecom sector, a potential financing source this year will be the 
proceeds from the partial sale of ethio telecom and from the 
issuance of two new telecom licenses. The allocation of these 
proceeds to the Government budget can cover part of the Birr 78bn 
domestic borrowing requirement, though this is not automatic and 
straightforward as privatization proceeds might also be directed 
towards the telecom company’s debt repayments or recapitalization 
needs. Considering this year’s pressing financing situation, it is likely 
that some share of privatization proceeds will be channelled to the 
government budget.  Indeed, the IMF staff report of May 2020 shows 
projections of up to Birr 44bn ($1.2bn) in privatization funds being 
directed to help fund the budget deficit, though the exact allocations 
from this source will likely be determined only once the privatization 
is complete and the magnitude of proceeds clearly known.    
 
While the precise mix among the above domestic/exceptional financing 
sources thus remains uncertain, some combination of all of the above four 
options is likely to be pursued by the Government so as to avoid an excessive 
reliance on any single source. The composition of financing shown in the 
Government-IMF program (per the May 2020 IMF Staff Report) points to a 
roughly 28%-42%-30% split among external-domestic-privatization financing

6 
sources for what was then projected to be a Birr 146bn deficit this year. Using 
the latest July 2020 budget figures (a Birr 126bn deficit), and applying a 
similar split would imply Birr 35bn-53bn-38bn in financing from 
external/domestic/privatization sources for this year. Such a split seems 
plausible and would imply at least Birr 53bn of domestic financing this year, 
or Birr 18bn each from  NBE, from banks, and from non-banks, if divided 
evenly among these three domestic funding sources (Table 10). 
 
A notable consequence of the surge in domestic borrowing will be the need 
for Government to significantly boost auction volumes in the Treasury Bill 
market. Since its launch in December 2019, the T-Bill market (in which 
commerical banks lend to Government by buying 28-day or 91-day Bills) has 
provided an estimated net Birr 12bn in funding to the Government as of end-
June 2020 (Table 11).3 Interest rates in this market have risen to a range of 6 
to 8 percent in the first half of 2020, from rates of around 1 to 3 percent prior 
to the current system of T-Bill auctions. Given the domestic borrowing 
requirements noted earlier, and taking into account the early trends seen 
from the three most recent auctions in July 2020, the Government will likely 
make allotments of as much as Birr 20-25bn (on a net basis) for the T-Bill 
market this fiscal year. As banks will be asked to buy a larger share of their 
loanable resources, and given the opportunity costs of those funds (derived 
ultimately from public deposits), we expect interest rates will trend higher 
and likely reach near double-digit levels (around 10 percent), bringing them 
closer to the rates that banks currently charge/receive for their least risky 
loans.4 
 
Finally, with respect to debt impacts, the recent decline seen in government 
debt ratios is likely to continue despite this year’s larger deficit. With 
nominal GDP rising by around 20 percent in Birr terms, the Government has 
the capacity to take on several percent of GDP in net new debt without a 
deterioration in debt ratios. By our calculations, Government debt—
excluding SOEs—should decline slightly to 33 percent of GDP by June 2021, 
compared to an estimated 35 percent of GDP outturn at the end of last year 
(Table 12).   
 
 
 
 
 
3 As shown in Table 11, total gross issuance for both types of T-bills was Birr 17.8bn up to June 
2020, though after accounting for estimated redemptions (given the short 28-day and 91-day 
maturities), we estimate the net outstanding issuance at around Birr 12 bn as of end-June 2020.   
4 A Birr 20bn to 25bn net purchase of T-Bills by banks this fiscal year would roughly double banks’ 
total exposure to government debt, as their outstanding lending to Government stood at Birr 
26bn as of end-2019. The projected exposure of Birr 46bn to 51bn as of end-June 2021 would 
amount to only 2.2 percent of bank deposits; for perspective, this figure would still be lower 
than the peak stock of NBE Bills held by banks, which was around Birr 95bn at end-2019.

Conclusion 
 
In sum, while appearing highly expansionary at first glance, this year’s 
Government Budget can arguably be seen as quite disciplined considering 
Ethiopia’s still-positive growth outlook and if viewed from a cross-country 
perspective.  When placed against Ethiopia’s past record, the domestic 
borrowing requirement this year is exceptionally large in nominal terms and 
will no doubt absorb a significant share of loanable funds that might have 
otherwise gone to the private sector. However, given the exceptional 
circumstances at hand—including the need to make large allocations for 
COVID-related health/economic support, elections, and security—the 
effective diversion of domestic funds towards such public sector priorities is 
understandable.  Moreover, with the budget deficit held at just 3.1 percent 
of GDP, policy-makers have not succumbed to dangerously loose fiscal 
policies, which might have further aggravated risks of even higher inflation 
and debt distress. The combination of large allocations for growth-promoting 
public investments (roads, education, health, irrigation, security) alongside 
only a modest deficit deterioration relative to GDP appears to have struck the 
right balance in our view—and also reveals a policy stance that is clearly 
sensitive to macro stability concerns while also firmly developmental in its 
orientation.
