EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
1. Is Ethiopia’s development model about to change? Not in its fundamental goals or objectives, but 
surely in the tools and tactics employed. We see economic policy shifting its focus in three areas—from 
public to private activities, from capital to current spending, and from debt to equity. 
 
2. Can high growth rates continue? In short, yes, but as public-sector spending becomes more restrained, 
a strong private sector offset will be needed. The sub-sectors where expectations are highest (export-
led manufacturing) may not be the best performing, but several domestic growth drivers will be strong 
substitutes. 
 
3. What investments are driving growth? The investments fuelling growth are becoming increasingly 
diversified—whether by asset type, by economic sub-sector, or by type of investor.  
 
4. When will single-digit inflation return? We expect a drop to 9 percent by end-March 2019, but inflation 
for most of 2019 will not fall much below the double-digit threshold. 
 
5. Have debt levels become worrisome? Debt servicing is really more of a challenge than debt levels, and 
even this only applies for public debt; private debt has plenty of room to grow. 
 
6. Can savings continue to rise? Further increasing savings rates will be tough among Ethiopia’s domestic 
savers, but a big boost is possible and likely from foreign ones.  
 
7. Will banking keep booming? Yes, and for many more years in our view, given Ethiopia’s still-low 
financial intermediation levels, untapped product offerings, and on-going investment activity. 
Shareholder returns will fall somewhat from recent highs, but not by much by our calculations. 
 
8. Is the financial sector opening soon? We don’t see an opening to foreign investors till after 2020, but 
expect domestic players to soon start trading in marketable debt and equity instruments.  
 
9. When could foreign exchange availability start improving? In a matter of days, were the Birr allowed 
to float freely. But under the current foreign exchange regime (our base case scenario), we expect the 
improvement will take place gradually as multiple initiatives put in place to boost fx supplies—in exports, 
services, remittances, and FDI—begin to fully kick in. 
 
10.  Where is the Birr heading? Absent a switch in the FX regime, we expect the central bank to adjust the 
Birr in line with inflation differentials vs trading partners and Ethiopia’s balance of payments conditions; 
reflecting our forecasts for both, we see the rate at 30.1 ETB/USD by end-2019 and 31.7 ETB/USD by 
end-2020.

1. Is Ethiopia’s Development Model About to Change? 
 
Key points 
 
§ Ethiopia’s economic policies have for a long time and for the most part followed the principles 
of a developmental state—involving a ‘big push’ by the state to jump-start priority activities, 
plus a heavy hand in charting the course of the agricultural, industrial, and financial sectors. 
 
§ Despite major economic reforms launched in 2018, there will not be—in our view—a 
fundamental departure from the developmental state approach, which we take as an 
economic policy framework that places growth as the overriding objective and where—in its 
pursuit—the state retains activist and interventionist policies with respect to land, industry 
and finance.  
 
§ Even so, the tools employed by policy-makers are clearly being modified, and we see 
economic policy shifting its attention in three areas—from public to private activities, from 
capital to current spending, and from debt to equity. Following recent reforms, we also expect 
policymakers to rely on a much more orthodox set of macroeconomic tools than was the case 
in the past.  
 
Background 
 
Ethiopia’s approach to economic policy-making has long been described as being one of a 
developmental state—and for good reason. Since the start of the country’s high-growth phase about 
15 years ago, policy priorities have been heavily focused on boosting GDP growth, with massive efforts 
directed at boosting public investment and raising agricultural output.  Budgetary spending, funded 
partly by enhanced revenue and substantially by new borrowing, was biased towards capital outlays 
and pro-poor spending in the form of infrastructure and social sector investments. Besides the ‘growth-
above-all-else’ orientation that shaped a range of policy initiatives, the country’s interventionist policies 
in the financial sector (ensuring low-cost funding sources as well as directed credit programs for priority 
projects) and in the industrial sector (active promotion of the emergence of certain sectors and 
industries) were all hallmarks of a developmental state. Other elements of the developmental state 
approach included ‘getting prices wrong’ in certain areas (via negative real interest rates for example), 
a closed capital account, government ownership of land (alongside user and leasing rights), and state 
engagement in certain productive activities—all of which, taken together, were dubbed as ‘the 
Ethiopian Way’ by the World Bank in one of the most extensive studies on Ethiopia’s recent growth and 
development policies.1

Not all of the government’s policies were those one would expect from a developmental state, 
however. For example, within agriculture—the economy’s largest employer and one of its largest 
sectors—laissez-faire policies were the norm: no subsidies were provided to farmers or 
minimum/maximum controls imposed their input or output prices. Trade policies were relatively 
liberal, with low average tariffs implying negligible efforts to provide infant industry protection for 
domestic industries. Perhaps most notable, exchange rate policies were not particularly geared towards 
boosting export growth as might have been expected—via highly competitive exchange rates—to be 
effected in a developmental state.  
 
Still, despite the mixed record, the following four features taken together surely merit the 
designation of a developmental state: (1) GDP growth was taken as the over-riding policy priority 
above all else; (2) land ownership was retained in state hands allowing for discretionary allocations to 
address important policy priorities (e.g., public housing, urban expansion, industrial parks, commercial 
farm allocations, public roads/infrastructure, etc.); (3) the industrial sector was nurtured, shaped, and 
directed through a range of activist and interventionist tools steering economic activity towards certain 
priorities and not to others (tax exemptions, industrial parks, directed loans/foreign exchange from 
state banks); and (4) the financial sector was closely regulated to serve developmental policy priorities 
by mobilizing low-cost savings from large segments of society, raising ‘captive funds’ from the private 
sector (NBE Bills, private pension funds), and funnelling low-cost funds to government, state 
enterprises, and (partially via DBE) to the private sector.  
 
Recent reforms and outlook 
 
Looking ahead, a key question is whether economic policies under Ethiopia’s reformist new 
administration will remove or retain the developmental state approach of the past. We attempt to 
address this by reviewing the full scope of reforms put in place so far, by judging these changes against 
the core elements of a developmental state, and by asking whether it is the fundamental goals or only 
the tools, tactics, and timing that seem likely to change for the period ahead.    
 
A set of sweeping economic policy changes have certainly been put in place in the ten months since 
the new administration of Prime Minister Dr. Abiy Ahmed took office in April 2018. The full scope of 
economic initiatives announced during the past year is presented below, based on a review of new 
policy announcements, the contents of the administration’s first new budget, the President’s 
(parliamentary opening) policy speech, the Prime Minister Office’s “New Horizon of Hope” one-pager 
strategy direction, and economic policy commitments under a newly agreed World Bank budget 
support loan.

Taken together, and as we see it, the reforms put in place this past year signal distinct changes in 
policy tools and in timing but not necessarily a shift in developmental approach. Privatization, for 
example, is not necessarily new (roughly 300 companies, collectively raising at least Birr 36 billion, have 
been privatized in the past two decades), but it is now being implemented with considerably greater 
breadth and depth. On the many set of issues related to the ease of doing business (procedures for 
company formation, registration, licensing, logistics), these have been addressed in piecemeal fashion 
in the past, but a much bolder, well-defined, and targeted effort seems to be now being put in place.  
With respect to macro policies, it is worth noting that a relatively ‘conservative’ and restrained stance 
has long been maintained for the government budget (with deficits limited to below 3 percent of GDP

and spending being cutback in line with revenue shortfalls), but what is different now is that other parts 
of the public sector—such as the state enterprises and public agencies—are also being subjected to 
greater fiscal discipline via a cutback in the scale of new borrowing, transparent audits, and 
privatization.2  
 
More significantly, judging by the four developmental state ‘markers’ laid out earlier, a fundamental 
break from that approach to economic development seems unlikely.  In particular, we see economic 
policy-making still guided by a vision that targets high GDP growth (critical to move towards middle-
income status) and that continues to retain substantial scope—especially compared to the vast majority 
of African and developing countries—for activist state interventions in land, industrial, and financial 
policies.  Looking at the four areas in more detail:  
 
• Growth: Boosting growth, and the job-creation/income earning opportunities associated with 
it, remains the fundamental guide for economic policy per repeated policy statements given by 
the new Prime Minister and administration. However, it is clear that the type of growth will 
increasingly be given as much attention, with a greater likely focus on its qualitative dimensions 
(job/income creation and ultimate impacts on household consumption) as well as its underlying 
sources (more private-sector and consumption-driven and less debt-reliant, as elaborated 
below) 
 
• Land will continue to remain in state hands for the foreseeable future, in our view, but be made 
available to the private sector via user rights (in agriculture) and long-term leases (in the 
urban/commercial sectors). The status quo provides policymakers extensive discretion in 
making priority allocations at the federal and regional level—be it for infrastructure, urban 
expansion, industrial parks, mining projects, commercial farming allocations, and other such 
projects deemed to be in the broader public interest. Such a heavy scope in the determination 
of land allocations is rare in developing countries—but also an undeniably powerful and 
potentially positive tool for a development-minded government working in the public interest. 
 
• Industry: With respect to the industrial sector, a center-piece of policy initiatives in this area has 
been and remains the development of 20-plus industrial parks to establish an export-led 
manufacturing base in Ethiopia. As only about a quarter of industrial parks have been finalized 
so far (8 out of 22),3 and their performance is still in its early stages, we expect close and 
continued nurturing on the part of the government, including work to simplify the ease of doing 
                                                        
2 Total public-sector financing averaged 9.5 percent of GDP on an annual basis in recent years (see IMF Article IV report of 
December 2018, Figure 3), but only 2.4 percent of GDP of this total was—on average—financing for government budget 
deficits while 7.1 percent of GDP was financing for state enterprise and other public sector entities.   
3 Industrial parks that have started at least partial operations as of end-2018 include: (1) Eastern Industrial Park (private); 
(2) Bole Lemi; (3) Hawassa Industrial Park; (4) Mekelle Industrial Park; (5) Kombolcha Industrial Park; (6) Adama Industrial 
Park; (7) Dire Dawa Industrial Park; and (8) Jimma Industrial Park. Close to 150 firms are now active in these eight industrial 
parks.

business for Industrial-Park based companies (especially in overcoming logistics and labor 
challenges) and various other hand-holding support until key targets begin to be met. 
 
• Finance: Unlike the openness to foreign capital planned in multiple areas (airlines, telecom, 
power, logistics), the dominant state bank was notably excluded from consideration for even a 
partial privatization and Ethiopia’s financial sector remains one of the few worldwide that is 
closed to foreign investors. This signals that directed lending schemes, as is common for a 
developmental state, will remain an important element of the financial system, though it is 
important to recognize that various emerging financing sources will also be taking hold at the 
same time. Accordingly, we expect various important public-sector directed financing 
mechanisms—such as the allocation of public pension savings to government financing at low 
cost, the expansion of the DBE, and the NBE bills requirement on private banks—to remain in 
place as they facilitate the mobilization of low-cost funds to priority beneficiaries (including 
private beneficiaries, it must be noted, as in the case of DBE). With respect to the budget, its 
broad expenditure orientation and priorities—a significant share of pro-poor expenditure 
focused on delivering key public goods—is also not significantly altered as already seen in the 
June 2018 passage of the new administration’s first budget. And finally, there are also no 
indications that the still-closed capital account would be up for opening as policymakers will aim 
(quite rightly at this stage) to restrict formal capital outflows so they may be channelled to 
domestic uses instead.  
 
A different type of Developmental State?  
 
While the approach taken towards economic development will thus retain the core elements of the 
past approach, we nonetheless see the emergence of a distinctly different type of developmental 
state. More specifically, we expect economic policy tools to shift their focus of attention from public to 
private activities, from capital to current spending (or investment to consumption), and from debt to 
equity.  Also, we see policymakers working with a much more orthodox set of macroeconomic tools 
than was the case in the past.  Some of these shifts were already beginning to emerge even before 
2018, but it is clear that the recent reform drive will make the shifts broader, deeper, and faster than 
was the case before.  
 
From public to private 
 
The scale of public sector activities and initiatives in Ethiopia is on course to be substantially reduced 
in many areas, and a much more private-sector friendly developmental state is now clearly taking 
hold in our view. The clearest manifestation of this is seen from: (1) the large privatization program 
involving partial equity sales of the four largest state-owned firms; (2) plans to fully handover equity 
stakes in a range of other mid-sized state enterprises; (3) a policy commitment and institutional 
revamping to henceforth rely on public-private partnerships for large infrastructure projects,  including 
through an already announced set of $7 billion worth of infrastructure projects seeking private

partnerships; and (4) a very recent initiative announced in December 2018 to radically alter and 
improve the doing business environment for Ethiopia’s private sector.

These four major shifts show a recognition of the public sector’s over-reach in recent years, and the 
likely end of large new state enterprise formations from here on. State involvement in the economy 
in recent years saw its entry into complex areas such as heavy metal industries, engineering works, 
sugar plants, and others. As has often been underlined by the new administration, the management 
expertise and project execution capabilities to run such complex entities has been in short supply in the 
public sector and, accordingly, policymakers have acknowledged a need to welcome private sector 
investment and management expertise in this areas.4 The explicit stance taken to either exit, sharply 
reduce, and/or re-assign to the private sector several major civil engineering works and 
industrial/manufacturing activities is also one of the clearest indications yet that policymakers will 
henceforth opt for a different set of tools (private investors rather state enterprises) than had been 
considered before. Indeed, it is reasonable to conclude that the establishment of large new state 
enterprises has come to an end, as has the reliance on dominant state enterprises for major productive 
activities within the economy.  
 
                                                        
4 In the case of Ethiopian Airlines, it is hard to argue that gaps in management expertise or skill sets were driving factors; 
instead,  financial motivations seem much more important in that case—and not so much to fund the airline’s own future 
growth but rather to capitalize on and share its long-accumulated and built-up value for the broader public sector.

The financial magnitudes and implications of these announced public-to-private shifts is also worth 
recognizing.  Privatization plans, as summarized in Table 1.2, could bring gains that are as high as a full 
year’s worth of government tax revenues (i.e., as much as $9 to $13bn), judging from the recent profits 
of the companies involved and simple comparisons to market valuations of similar companies in other 
markets.5  On top of that, recently announced PPP projects of around $7.5bn, though being 
implemented over many years, also amounts to almost another year’s worth of government revenue; 
in many of these projects, it is expected that the private sector will raise the required funds and, in 
exchange, retain some ownership stake or share in some future stream of revenues. The FX infusion 
possible from both these sources (assuming mostly foreign equity involvement) is also significant in 
each case, amounting to several multiples of yearly goods exports and also several multiples of the 
current stock of foreign reserves. Thus, even when seen just in broad orders of magnitude, the 
mobilization of private funding from privatization and via PPP programs can potentially free up two-
years worth of government revenue and three-years worth (in fx terms) of goods exports for re-
deployment of funds in the many areas where spending by the state is needed to do its job well. 
 
From capital to current spending (or investment to consumption) 
 
In parallel with the growing space being created for the private sector, Ethiopia’s growth model is in 
our view henceforth likely to follow a path that places a somewhat greater weight on consumption 
rather than investment—both due to the budgetary constraints of making new investments and given 
the need to rebalance the final use of resources after a decade of massive investment.  Both investment 
and consumption can of course be expected to rise in nominal terms, but the relative size of the latter 
should begin to trend up in overall GDP. From a macroeconomic perspective, it is worth noting that 
Ethiopia has one of the world’s highest investment-to-GDP ratios, which has helped build the physical 
hardware needed for a fast-modernizing economy. However, allocating close to 40 percent of a 
country’s aggregate resources towards investment does—by accounting identity—imply a 
corresponding reduction in domestic consumption, unless foreign savings/resources can provide a 
partial offset.  Such a squeeze in consumption relative-to-GDP has been evident from a national 
accounts perspective, which shows consumption down to 75 percent of GDP last year from a peak of 
90 percent a decade ago. Expressed differently, as the focus of the past decade was (appropriately) on 
building up the country’s hard assets and physical infrastructure (capital spending), much less has been 
                                                        
5 As summarized in Table 1.1, profits of the three large state enterprises for which data is available—Ethio Telecom, 
Ethiopian Airlines, and ELSE—were around $0.7bn, $0.2bn, and $0.1bn respectively in recent years. A simple valuation 
exercise of using price-to-earnings ratios of 8x-12x (the common range observed for most of their peers in emerging 
markets) would suggest total valuations of $9 to $13 billion, and roughly equivalent equity injections were close to 50 
percent of these firms open to equity investment. This of course ignores detailed information that would be needed on their 
(IFRS-based) financials, and also does not account for several potential adjustments related to their debt load (which would 
lower estimated valuations) or their likely stronger-than-comparables growth prospects (which would raise valuations).  The 
regulatory/pricing/competitive environment in which the firms are allowed to operate would also be an important 
consideration. Still, these estimates are probably a reasonable balance of these offsetting factors, and—notably—do not 
account for equity inflows from the privatization of smaller state enterprises (beyond these largest ones) as well as large 
one-off inflows possible by sale of two new telecom licenses, as committed in recent policy documents (see Table 1.1).

spent proportionately on recurrent and consumption spending (including maintenance and wages for 
example); roads have been built but followed by limited allocations made for maintenance, universities 
have been constructed but less resources made available for recurring operational expenses, and 
similarly for the construction of public health and schooling facilities.  
 
Some loosening of allocations for current and consumption spending is thus to be expected in the 
coming years—and early signs of this were actually beginning to appear since 2016.6. The most recent 
fiscal year, for example, has shown a fall in the budget’s share of capital expenditure, from 46 to 41 
percent of total government spending, equivalent to a drop from 8.3 to 6.5 percent of GDP. At the same 
time, all new capital projects have been suspended, to allow existing ones to be fully funded and 
executed. More broadly, reflecting public sector restraint, the share of capital goods in total imports 
has fallen (from a peak of 41.8 percent four years ago to 34.5 percent of total imports in FY 2017-18), 
as has the overall investment-to-GDP ratio (from 39 to 34 percent of GDP over the same period). This 
rebalancing is likely to remain broadly in place in the coming years, in our view, as policymakers will 
likely find it important to ease years of sacrifice in domestic savings/investment by allowing somewhat 
more consumption (relative to income) in the years ahead.  
 
 
                                                        
6 It is possible and indeed likely that some of this re-balancing was due to fiscal constraints and not necessarily reflective 
of deliberate policy choices; looking ahead, however, we would expect that a somewhat higher share of consumption 
spending (relative to GDP) will reflect more explicit policy preferences.

From debt to equity and use of own resources 
 
Finally, after a decade of relying upon substantial amounts of domestic and external borrowing, the 
coming years are likely to show a moderation of debt accumulation by state enterprises as they make 
greater use of equity injections and their own (internally-generated) financial resources. Following 
substantial external debt reduction soon after the start of the new millennium, Ethiopia started its high-
growth phase with a very low external debt base of just 11 percent of GDP in 2007/08 (external debt 
was 87 percent of GDP at its peak in 2002, prior to international debt relief granted by multilateral and 
bilateral lenders). Policymakers have—quite rightly—proceeded to use external savings/financing to 
deliver a range of public infrastructure investments in roads, power plants, health, education and 
related public goods. However, with public debt as of June 2018 at around 60 percent of GDP (with 30 
percent of GDP in external debt), and given rising debt servicing costs, the scope for adding on more 
debt has diminished (see Chapter 5). The privatization program is thus a timely and appropriate means 
of substituting debt with equity, and of avoiding future debt liabilities by sacrificing some ownership 
stake in the accumulated value and net worth built-up in key public assets. 
 
Beyond privatization, efforts to boost state enterprises’ own resources are likely to be seen more 
widely as the public sector moves away from a heavy reliance on debt.  This reform is essentially 
equivalent to enabling state enterprises to build-up their own equity or financing base, and is being 
observed with the electricity company (through gradual tariff adjustments, while shielding lowest-
income consumers), the petroleum-importing enterprise (through recent adjustments in long-frozen 
fuel prices), the housing corporation (through its recent initiatives to revise long-frozen rental rates), 
and the public condominium housing projects (where price increases have been put in place to help 
cover one of the government’s main urban initiatives whose costs—if fully implemented—will exceed 
that of the Grand Renaissance Dam project).  Boosting the capacities of various public entities to cover 
their own costs may also be unavoidable in other areas—such as railways, water, etc.—thus ultimately 
reducing the public sector’s reliance on large-scale debt accumulation.    
 
Finally, for the specific cases of the largest state enterprises that are slated for partial privatization, 
the rebalancing in the use of debt vs equity financing sources is likely to be seen quite explicitly.  
Given their starting positions, the past approach of the state airlines, telecom, power, and logistics 
enterprises focused heavily on debt as a means of financing: Ethiopian Airlines, for example, raised its 
debt from Birr 3.6bn to Birr 62.6b ($0.3bn to $2.4bn) between 2010-11 and 2017-18 (per the past 
annual reports on its website and press release of 2017-18 results), while equity rose four-fold over the 
same period rose from Birr 8bn to near Birr $32bn. For Ethio Telecom, we presume that their external 
debt now stands at $1.2bn (taking the sum non-guaranteed state-enterprise debt in MOFEC debt data 
less EAL’s debt).  Based on NBE data on local bond issues, the electricity company’s domestic debt has 
risen from Birr 65bn five years ago to Birr 216bn as of June 2018 ($3.9 to $7.9bn, or near 10 percent of 
GDP), again revealing a large reliance on debt financing, mainly from CBE. For all these cases, a 
presumed 49 percent part-privatization in the near future will significantly rebalance the composition 
of their financing sources, as the amounts raised in equity form could potentially be well in excess of

13 
outstanding debt levels. Debt-to-equity ratios should thus improve sharply, possibly falling below 1x to 
the extent that the firms retain some part of the privatization-related equity injections (or any premium 
values) on their own balance sheets.  
 
 
 
Conclusion  
 
In sum, based on our judgement of recent reforms, the developmental state in Ethiopia is likely here 
to stay but in a form where the focus now is much more explicitly towards building the private rather 
than the parastatal sector. GDP growth will surely remain a top policy objective, as reaching middle-
income status remains a national priority, but it is reasonable to expect more emphasis on aggregate 
consumption (to boost household incomes and living conditions) rather than primarily on investment, 
and a greater focus should also be expected on the qualitative rather than just quantitative aspects of 
growth. Similarly, while land policies are unlikely to change (remaining in state hands but with long-
term leases available for the private sector), one can anticipate much greater sensitivity to 
displacements arising from development and investment initiatives, including improved approaches 
that better benefit both the affected communities and the private developers.  In other areas, activist 
industrial policies are expected to stay in place (not least because of the state’s key role in building and 
managing over 20 industrial parks), but the actual work of manufacturing, exporting, agro-processing, 
and mining appears quite likely from here on to be entrusted predominantly to the private sector—
including in those unconventional areas into which the state had ventured in recent years.  And in 
finance, it is hard to see the dominant role of the large state bank being replaced any time soon, but 
it’s lending will increasingly support the private sector (as equity inflows and own resources cover a 
rising share of state enterprise needs), while the rapid growth of private banks and of other financing 
prospects (capital markets, foreign investment) will soon provide additional sources and instruments 
of private sector funding. Finally, the broad orientation of the government budget—a heavy focus on 
pro-poor expenditure—is also unlikely to be significantly altered.  All of the trends anticipated above—
the state’s continued focus on maintaining high GDP growth, its likely shift to doing a narrower set of 
functions that a state needs to do well, and its much more whole-hearted support of what is still in 
Ethiopia an emerging private sector—are in our view welcome, pragmatic, and promising directions 
that bode very well for the years ahead.

2. Can high growth rates continue? 
 
Key Points 
 
§ Ethiopia’s high rates of growth can continue for many more years, in our view, but as public-
sector spending becomes more restrained, a strong private sector offset will be needed. 
 
§ Looking at specific economic sub-sectors, medium-term growth prospects are encouraging in 
agriculture (large scope for yield improvements from still-low levels), manufacturing (with the 
launch of 20-plus industrial parks), mining (as multiple new projects begin to come on line), 
construction (still-large backlog of unmet residential and industrial needs), and services (on-
going expansion in airlines, tourism, and logistics). 
 
§ For the immediate period ahead, 2019 and 2020, growth will probably fall short of 
expectations in some areas where there are high hopes (export-led manufacturing), but large 
expansions should be forthcoming in domestic-focused sub-sectors such as services, 
construction, and agriculture.  We think there are strong reasons to expect growth of at least 
9 percent for the current fiscal year.  
 
In 2018, Ethiopia experienced its 15th year of strong growth and at the same time the slowest growth 
in 15 years. In this context, we ask three questions about the growth outlook.  First, if one of the main 
drivers of past growth (large-scale public-sector investment) is being scaled back, what might serve as 
a substitute in the coming years? Second, can Ethiopia still rely on the financing sources—particularly 
the sharp rise in both domestic savings and in external borrowing—that were critical in fuelling past 
growth? Third, considering a range of growth determinants, what kind of growth rates should 
reasonably be expected for the near-term?

Understanding past growth 
 
Ethiopia’s past growth has certainly been driven in strong part by public sector investment. As widely 
recognized, the build-up of extensive public infrastructure (roads, rail, power, telecom, water systems) 
has contributed a significant share of recent growth, as have massive public-sector investments in 
health and education. Further public-sector investments in the agriculture—equivalent to 10 percent 
of the budget—also worked to improve the ‘super-structure’ of markets and institutions in that sector, 
most notably by improving input availability (seeds, fertilizers) and encouraging better farming 
practices (via a large ‘army’ of extension workers, model farmer programs, and the like).7 Reflecting the 
aggregate significance of such public-sector interventions, the World Bank’s decomposition of growth 
(between factor inputs and productivity) finds a strong role of for both higher productivity as well as 
increased factor inputs such as labor, capital, and land. For agriculture, in particular, World Bank 
analysis has found that about 45% of the increased crop output reflected an increase in three primary 
inputs (land, labor, capital), 22% was due to higher productivity, 12% reflected better seeds, and 8% 
was due to more fertilizer use.  
 
At the same time, the growth story has not simply been one of expanding state activity.  There has 
been a widening of the overall economic base towards newer areas in which the private sector has 
been active, particularly services and construction.  Even in agriculture, for example, the ten-year 
increase in production (from 16.1mn to 30.6mn tons), in acreage (from 10.9mn hectares to 12.7mn 
hectares), and in yields (from 1.47 tons/hectare to 2.41 tons/hectare) reflects not just the impact of 
                                                        
7 As highlighted by World Bank analysis (see “Ethiopia’s Great Run report”), only 4 African countries devoted 10 percent of 
their budget to agriculture, and the country’s farmer extension program was noted for having the highest ratio of extension 
workers-to-farmer in the world.  References to growth decomposition are also derived from this World Bank report.

multiple public-sector interventions but also private sector initiatives and responsiveness (i.e., the 
results of 15 million farm households throughout Ethiopia adopting more and/or better seeds, 
fertilizers, tools, and farming practices). As in agriculture, construction expansion appears to reflect the 
joint impact of both public sector and private sector initiatives, the former for driving public 
infrastructure and the latter in executing projects (as contractors) for both public projects as well as for 
private developments such as the vastly increased numbers of commercial and residential buildings 
seen throughout major cities. Finally, on services, we see again the strong role of public sector 
expansion (public employee numbers are up from 0.6 million ten years ago to near 1.5 million as of 
2018) and of private sector in the form of rapid expansion in retail trade, hotels, banking, and private 
health and education services. In each of the above areas, the role of private sector growth and 
expansion has been critical to supplement public sector interventions—whether that refers to the 
millions of small holder farmers that capitalized on a more favourable set of opportunities, construction 
sector operators implementing a range of public/private projects, or service sector enterprises in 
trading, hotels, banking, and other areas responding to rising demand in their respective domains.

The broad-based nature of growth sources is captured by alternative indicators of economic activity 
that need not rely solely on GDP statistics. Such non-GDP indicators serve as an alternative to national 
accounts statistics, whose reliability may be questioned because of weaknesses in coverage, 
compilation, or methodology. These indicators broadly support the existence of strong growth, even if 
one may question the precise figure reported for growth. In particular, double-digit growth rates are 
seen in much more readily quantifiable areas such electricity demand (11%), air cargo volume (18%), 
shipping cargo volume (25%), vehicle registrations (13%) and real deposit levels (13%).  In addition, one 
observes high single-digit growth in fuel consumption (9%), real loan levels (8%), and tourist arrivals 
(6%).

In short, while past growth can be said to have been dominated by public sector drivers, it has also 
been supported by an expanding private sector; looking ahead, however, with greater restraint in 
public sector activity (per Chapter 1), the burden of maintaining growth will lie much more heavily 
on boosting supply within the private sector. And for the private sector to take on this burden, it will 
be more critical than ever that: (1) the state do well those functions that only it can do well (security, 
public goods, basic health and education); (2) the ease of doing business improves substantially to allow 
simplified company formation and growth; and (3) financing becomes more readily available to help 
finance private sector expansion.  In all three areas, the orientation of recent reforms is precisely 
towards these directions, boding well for medium-term growth.  
 
Financing Future Growth 
 
A review of the financing of past growth reveals that high growth was fuelled by high investment 
rates, which in turn was made possible by a jump in both domestic savings and external debt 
accumulation. Looking at the past five years, average investment to GDP ratios of near 37 percent have 
led to average growth rates of near 9 percent over the same period, indicating that roughly 4 percent 
of GDP in new investment is driving approximately 1 percentage point of GDP in growth.  Moreover, of 
the 37 percent average investment to GDP ratio seen in the last five years, the equivalent of 22 percent 
of GDP was funded from domestic savings, while the remaining 15 percent of GDP was covered via 
externally-generated resources in the form of remittances, grants, loans and FDI.  In essence, the 
momentum of Ethiopia’s growth has been driven by keeping high investment rates at 34-39 percent of 
GDP (which translated to growth rates of 8-10 percent) and by financing that high investment with both 
an expanded pool of domestic savings (24 percent of GDP in FY 2017-18 from below 10 percent of GDP 
a decade ago) and through much increased financing resources (particularly debt) from the rest of the 
world. 
 
Looking ahead, while the dominant financing sources of the past are moderating or plateauing, there 
are emerging substitutes that can prevent a drop in GDP growth. Even if investment rates are scaled 
back somewhat from recent highs (as argued in Chapter 1), they will very likely remain in the 
neighbourhood of 34-36 percent of GDP, and the needed savings/financing sources to sustain growth 
will thus remain correspondingly high.  And with public sector borrowing becoming more restrained, 
resources available to maintain growth would appear likely to fall significantly, thus cutting growth.  
However, as highlighted earlier, while foreign debt may not rise as fast as in the past, it is being 
substituted by foreign equity, and while the public sector’s foreign borrowing is becoming more 
restrained, the private sector’s foreign borrowing is beginning to rise (see Chapter 5). Moreover, while 
investment may moderate somewhat (no longer reaching almost 40% of GDP), we are likely to see an 
offset from an improved efficiency of—increasingly private sector—investment, such that 4 percent of 
GDP in investment is no longer required to yield 1 percentage point of GDP in growth. Thus, in principle 
at least, growth can continue at or close to recent rates as long as there is a sufficient offset in the 
nature of the investment flows (more private-sector driven) and in their composition (more equity to 
compensate for moderating debt).

Considerations for Future Growth 
 
At a very high level and seen in broadly qualitative terms, the influences on Ethiopia’s growth involve 
a number of macroeconomic, sector-specific, policy, political economy, investment climate, and 
external considerations. We present some of these influences, both on past growth and on the 
medium-term outlook, and qualitatively summarize our observations and the implications for near-
term growth in Table 2.7.  In broad terms, we find that the economy’s supply side and demand side 
growth drivers should remain in place, though perhaps with compositional shifts whereby 
manufacturing and agriculture become more important than services, and where consumption may 
deliver a stronger growth impulse than investment. Seen from the perspective of the economic actors 
driving growth, while the public sector is likely to be showing more restraint in the coming years 
(reflecting debt considerations), this can—and likely will—be substituted by the private sector, thus 
limiting possible growth slowdowns.  Macro policies, reflecting a more orthodox fiscal and monetary 
stance, will probably be less conducive to growth in the short-term, but should not necessarily be so in 
the longer term and can, in any case, provide even a shorter-term boost if more is done to boost 
external competitiveness. In most other areas, the prospects for growth are either much improved or 
no worse than recent years: whether looking at investment climate considerations (ease of doing 
business reforms are now singled out as a policy priority and are being aided by World Bank support); 
the impact of public confidence and sentiment (which has been quite positive considering 
diaspora/remittance flows); or from a political economy perspective (where greater political openness 
may contribute to a more complicated policy process in the near-term, but could at same time deliver 
more durable pro-growth policies and outcomes over the longer term). Finally, while the external 
environment facing Ethiopia is clouded by potential drags on growth from low commodity prices and a 
possible slowdown in global trade, this would be offset in some areas (lower oil prices imply a lower 
fuel bill) and there is also on the horizon a potentially important growth boost from a much improved 
regional geopolitical and economic environment, especially prospects for deeper trade/investment 
relationships with Eritrea, Sudan, Somalia, Djibouti and Kenya.

Table 2.7: A Qualitative Review of Growth Influences: Ethiopia's Past Record and Future Outlook
Growth Determinants across different dimensions:
Growth Outlook
1 Role of GDP supply side growth determinants          
(agriculture, manufacturing, services)
Expansion across all three boosted growth, 
though most heavily from agriculture & services 
in earlier years, and construction in most recent 
years
Growth still likely to be broad-based, but more 
dominant role seen from industry and agriculture, 
less from services (See Table 2.10)
2 Role of GDP demand side growth determinants 
(consumption, investment, government, net exports)
Consumption was as high as 90% of demand five 
years ago, but is now 75%; investment 34% GDP 
in 2017-18, but near 38% in prior four years 
Somewhat more consumption and less investment 
likely to follow after a decade of high savings and 
investment
3 Role of economic actors: public sector, private 
sector, corporate sector, household sector, financial 
sector, 
Publc sector expansion key, as was financial 
sector in boosting savings/intermediation
With public sector restraint expected, more 
growth contributions expected from private sector, 
particularly corporate and financial sector within it
4 Role of macroeconomic sectors:                           
Real, Fiscal, Monetary, and External sectors
Activist fiscal and monetary policies important, 
less growth boost from external sector
Less role likely for unorthodox fiscal, monetary 
policies, but possibly more focus on external sector 
competitiveness
5 Role of factors of production: Capital, Labor, Land 
and of Productivity (TFP)
Large expansions in capital, labor, land were key, 
while productivity (TFP) was also a high share of 
growth, per WB analysis
Continued focus on boosting capital, labor, and 
land use, but shift to industries with higher output-
per-worker (e.g. manufacturing) may boost 
contribution from productivity
6 Role of labor force participation: Per Capita GDP = 
[Labor Force/Population] x [Output/Labor Force]
Large expansion in employment was important as 
was Total Factor Productivity (TFP)
Continued expansion in employment should propell 
per capitaGDP growth
7 Confidence and sentiment indicators and 
expectations across key sectors (domestic private 
sector, portfolio investors, ratings agencies, etc)
Not very meaningful given lack of private capital 
markets and no external portfolio flows
Economic sentiment/expectations to become 
more important as capital markets/FDI become 
more important. Positive sentiment contributing to 
higher remittance inflows
8 Policy commitment, primacy given to growth, and 
internal organization for growth
Strong "everything-for-growth" policy drive and 
orientation 
Strong "everything-for-growth" policy drive and 
orientation likely to remain in place, but more 
focus also likely on type and quality of growth
9 Policy execution capacity for growth
High execution capacity given strong federal 
government and centralized decision-making
Strong execution capacity likely to remain in place, 
but regional competiton and policy differences 
may also bring differences in regional growth 
records
10 Political Economy factors/explanations:
Political unrest and instability in 2016 and 2017 
dampened growth in those years, but more stable 
conditions in earlier years had facilitated 
investment and growth
Period of political reform may bring 
tensions/uncertainties, including in run up to 2020 
elections, but also offers positive prospects for a 
more durable and consensus-based political 
economy in the longer-term
11 External influences on domestic growth              
[global commodity prices, export/import prices, 
global interest rates, risk to emerging markets]
Mostly favorable external environment for growth 
during 2008-14, but turned adverse in 2014-18. 
Risk appetite towards emerging markets not of 
much significant for Ethiopia.
External influences positive on falling oil prices, 
but still adverse for low commodity prices (coffee, 
sesame). Risk appetite towards EM/FM may 
matter more given start of capital markets

Table 2.8: Ethiopia's Medium-Term Growth Considerations by Specific Sub-Sectors
AGRICULTURE
Crops
Arable land: Only 15% percent of arable land cultivated; large scope for new cultivations
Commercial farming sector largely unexploited (except horticulture) but huge potential
Irrigation: Boosting currently low (10%) irrigation coverage would boost yields
Yields can be raised sharply with widening of model farmer practices and pilot programs
Initiatives in contract farming, waste reduction, & in other areas
Fruits & Vegs
Horticulture: Exports of $230mn at present, but land allocation to sector being doubled
High value crops such as herbs, spices still relatively untapped but with large prospects
Cargo/cold-storage infrastructure now in place at AA airport to handle large export volumes
Livestock
Large scope to better develop Africa's largest and world's 6th largest livestock population
INDUSTRY
Mining
Explorations underway for gold, potash, iron ore, copper, silica, and others
Oil explorations on-going, with encouraging finds in 2018 and more likely in 2019-20
Natural gas production expected from recent explorations over coming years
Manufacturing
22 industiral parks under development, 150 firms so far in 8 operational industrial parks
Large local market offers huge scope for FMCGs: foodstuffs, homecare, personal care,
Rising SME numbers with boost this sub-sector
Construction
Still-substantial govt allocations for road, public works, infrastructure will propel growth
Govt housing development plans likely to be re-started, including with foreign participation
Several dozen high-rises under construction in AA's business and banking districts
Private real estate projects (including foreign ones) likely to increase given relaxed rules
Power
On-going dam projects include GERD, and close to half-dozen other smaller dams 
Two large geo-thermal projects under process, each of $4bn value if fully executed
SERVICES
Dozens of star-rated hotels in pipeline, with 5,000-plus room expansion likely in few years
Several initiatives (on entry visas, conference promotion, tour packages) will boost inflows
Trading
Wholesale and retail trade will rise with overall economic activity and population growth
Transport & Comm Rising urbanization, pop growth, airline/rail expansion will drive continued expansion
Financial Sector
Still-strong momentum in bank deposit/lending growth given unmet/pent-up demand
Real Estate
Loosening of rules for foreign entry likely to boost real estate services
Sector's large pent-up demand could multiply with greater financing options for buyers
Public Admin
Large population expansion (~2mn per year) will imply rising public admin services
Education
Large population expansion (~2mn per year) will boost (public/private) education offerings
Health
Large population expansion (~2mn per year) will boost (public/private) health offerings

Outlook for 2019 and 2020 
 
With respect to specific forecasts for FY 2018-19, we see the record crop harvest expected for late 
2018, improved private external inflows, and continued expansion in domestic services as the basis 
for projecting higher growth this year compared to last year’s 7.7 percent. In particular, we see the 
following outlook across the main economic sub-sectors: 
 
• Agriculture: Given favourable rains across most regions throughout the main rainy season (July-
September 2018), expectations are for a record crop harvest at end 2018.  More specifically, we 
anticipate total acreage farmed will have reached 10.4mn hectares this year (up from 10.2mn 
last year), and assuming slightly better yields than last year, major crop production should grow 
by 6-7 percent and exceed 32 million tons (up from 30.6mn tons last year). This strong growth 
in the core economic sector will feed through to other closely allied sectors including transport, 
services, and agro-processing based manufacturing.   
 
 
 
• Industry: Industry as a whole should continue to show strong growth on the back of 
construction and power expansion, as has been the case in recent years. The growth 
contribution of industrial parks is not yet likely to be as high as construction, given that most 
are in their early stages.  Also, given the still-high reliance on imports for firms in industrial parks 
their output will—at least in the near term—be more important for boosting gross exports and 
job-creation rather than for increasing value-addition, i.e. GDP.

• Services: On the services side, banking trends in the first quarter of the year suggest a slowdown 
in activity (growth was only 5 percent for deposits and 4 percent for loans in the period between 
end-June and end-September 2018), but some pick-up is likely in the coming months and 
annualized growth rates suggest deposit growth can reach 22 percent and loan growth 20 
percent for this fiscal year. Other areas such as airlines and tourism show strong momentum for 
the year based on Q1 data, with airline passenger numbers likely to go up from 10.6 to 12mn 
this year and tourism inflows from 1.11 million to 1.24 million; the latter two areas should be 
boosted by recent reforms on visitor visa requirements and other sector-specific initiatives.  
Service sectors such as local usage of hotels, rentals, entertainment are also likely to show 
strong growth given much strong remittance flows so for this year; CBE alone reported $1bn in 
remittance flows for just the July-September quarter, suggesting close to $6 billion in total 
remittance flows is possible for this year—a record 6.3 percent of GDP—after also accounting 
for private bank inflows.  
 
• Taxes and Trade: Beyond sector-specific trends, other macro data suggest somewhat weak 
trends so far in the fiscal year. The performance of tax collections, for example, is up only 8 
percent (in nominal terms) for the first five months of the fiscal year compared to the same 
period last year (Birr 82bn vs Birr 77bn), but it is not yet clear if this is mainly due to weak tax 
collection or a broader slowdown in growth as well.  Also suggesting weak economic activity are 
recent import data, which were down 9 percent in the first quarter of the fiscal year ($3,682mn 
in July-September 2018 vs $4,034mn during the same period last year); the import slowdown 
likely reflects fx constraints and implicit quantitative rationing, however, and may thus not tell 
us much about broader growth developments.  Exports, which are only around 3 percent of GDP 
and have had a loose relationship with GDP for many years, were also weak so far in the year 
(down 7 percent in the first quarter of the fiscal year, or just $628mn vs $678mn in the same 
period last year). In all three cases, as the data only represent a few months outturns, we do not 
read too much into these early signals, though a continuation of such trends for the next two 
quarters would warrant a reconsideration of this year’s growth outlook. 
 
• Overall GDP growth: All things considered, we project growth of 9.0 percent for 2018-19, given 
our sub-sector projects of 6.5 growth in agriculture, 12 percent in industry, and 8.8 percent in 
services. For FY 2019-20, based mainly on agriculture returning to a more trend growth rate, we 
forecast GDP growth of around 8.5 percent.

Compared to other forecasts for the Ethiopian economy, our growth projections are somewhat above 
the median. Our compilation of more than a dozen projections of FY 2018-19 growth show forecasts 
are as high as 11 percent (Ministry of Finance and Economic Cooperation) and as low as 7.2 percent 
(Economist Intelligence Unit). The median across all growth projections is 8.3 percent. We believe we 
are somewhat more optimistic than the median due to our expectations for growth rates in agriculture 
(reflecting our more positive judgement on this year’s crop harvest) and in services (we see a stronger 
impact from private remittance and capital inflows than is perhaps assumed by others).

As with any economic projections, the anticipated growth rates are of course not without risks and 
implicitly assume certain baseline assumptions regarding the domestic political economy and policy 
environment. In our projections, we assume stable political conditions, particularly in the run up to the 
2020 elections, and a continuity in the recently launched policies of the new administration. We also 
expect that the execution of macroeconomic and sector-specific policies will be broadly in line with 
announced plans, per the Government’s 2018-19 budget, the Prime Minister’s ‘New Horizon of Hope’ 
one-pager strategy document, and the Government’s own reform commitments (especially to ease the 
doing business environment) as set out in the recent World Bank lending package.  Should these 
baseline assumptions not hold, investment activity by the local private sector could be held back and 
foreign investment inflows also reduced, implying that the recent restraint in public sector spending is 
not sufficiently offset by private sector expansion. 
 
Could growth turn out even higher? Yes, some targeted policy reforms could potentially return 
growth back to double-digit levels for a sustained period. In our view, such growth accelerators could 
involve: (1) an active promotion and establishment of large commercial farms (targeting several dozen 
private commercial farms for key crops/fruits/vegetables may merit as much policy attention and 
priority as the establishment of several dozen large industrial parks); (2) a rapid implementation of—
and securing quick wins in—the recently launched campaign to improve Ethiopia’s Doing Business 
rankings; (3) promoting the emergence of large ‘domestic champions’ and ‘super-star’ companies 
(particularly exporters) in line with much recent literature that emphasizes the unique role of a few 
dozen such large firms in driving export and manufacturing growth;8 (4) a possible immediate move to 
a market-clearing rate exchange rate to remove serious distortions and bottlenecks in this area (see 
Chapter 9); and (5) a push to put in place a national digital payment system (with state direction if need 
be, per the Indian model) that facilitates a range of payment types (P2P/P2B/P2G), enables e-commerce 
activities, and boosts small entrepreneurship and access to credit. Needless to say, each one of these 
areas would call for certain enabling conditions in the policy and regulatory environment as well as 
possible targeted and temporary state support, while the feasibility of each in the Ethiopian context 
would also warrant close review. Even so, the examples of Rwanda (in improving its Doing Business 
rankings), of South East Asia (in promoting large exporters), and of Kenya and India (with contrasting 
models for transformative innovations in the digital and payments space) are inspiring and worth 
emulating as both growth accelerators and job creators in the Ethiopian context.

3. What investments are driving growth? 
 
Key points 
 
§ As high investment has been the fuel propelling Ethiopia’s strong growth, we look closely into 
what exactly comprises investment—by type of asset, by economic sub-sector, and by type of 
investor. 
 
§ Though not widely recognized, private investment has overtaken public investments in recent 
years and now makes up more than half of total investment in the economy. Most of this 
private investment has—so far—been driven by domestic rather than foreign sources. By 
asset type, investment is concentrated on infrastructure/civil works and capital equipment 
outlays, while by economic sub-sector, it is dominated by flows into industry (which includes 
construction) as opposed to agriculture or services.  
 
§ Looking ahead, we forecast that private investment will soon make up close to two-thirds of 
total investment (thus 2x public investment) and will increasingly come from foreign sources.  
 
Ethiopia stands out among most African and developing countries for its consistently high investment 
rates in recent years. Total investment to GDP averaged 39 percent of GDP for the four years between 
FY 2013/14 and FY 2016/17, compared to a Sub-Saharan African average of 20 percent of GDP, Middle 
East average of 29 percent of GDP and an Asian average of 30 percent of GDP. Among African countries, 
Ethiopia has the one of the highest rate of investment even after a drop to 34 percent of GDP registered 
in the most recent fiscal year ending in June 2018. 
 
Expressed in monetary terms, investment has risen to Birr 750 billion in FY 2017-18, up from Birr 
403bn five years ago, and Birr 83bn a decade ago. In USD terms, investment is now around USD 29bn 
per year, up from just USD7.6bn decade ago. Put in a cross-country context, the USD 29bn of investment 
in Ethiopia is not far from the absolute levels seen in much bigger economies (investment stood at USD 
38bn in Egypt and USD 52bn in Nigeria) and also double the investment levels of economies closer to 
Ethiopia’s size ($15bn in Kenya and $14bn in Tanzania). 
 
Looking beyond the high investment levels, we attempt to decompose its underlying components by 
type of asset, by economic sector, and by type of owner. From a national accounts perspective, the 
total of Birr 752 bn (USD 29bn) in aggregate investment can be broken down along the following three 
dimensions:  
• Investment by asset type: By definition, investments are comprised of five main asset types, 
namely: (1) infrastructure outlays (such as for roads, rail, power, water systems, etc); (2) 
machinery and plant equipment; (3) building-related civil works (for public sector, commercial, 
and residential uses); (4) transport vehicles including trucks and vehicles; and (5) land 
improvements, including irrigation and similar projects. While such a breakdown of investment

28 
components is not publicly available for Ethiopia, we would highlight the following figures to 
approximate the magnitudes involved—and their estimated rankings— across the various asset 
types: 
 
o Infrastructure projects (road, rail, power, and related projects): Annual spending in this 
area would be as high as Birr 300bn in FY 2017-18, if the full government capital budget 
(Birr 144 bn) and state enterprise use of financing (Birr 129 bn) were assumed to be 
devoted to infrastructure/civil works outlays. A more realistic range is that about two-
thirds to three-fourths of these totals represent infrastructure projects, implying an 
estimated range of Birr 280bn to Birr 293bn (the remainder would be comprised of 
machinery/equipment plus buildings-related civil works; see below). 
  
o Machinery and plant equipment: Capital goods imports provide a good approximation 
in this area, given the very limited local production of such hardware, and would suggest 
amounts of as much as Birr 105bn (taking Birr 145 bn in total capital goods imports last 
year less vehicle and trucks imports).  
 
o Building-related civil works: The scope of investment in this area would include the full 
range of government-led civil works projects (universities, schools, health centers), large 
state-enterprise led building projects (public housing, industrial parks) plus private 
residential and commercial building developments.  Calculated as a residual (given 
figures for the four other investments by asset type), the total amount of investment in 
this area is estimated to be in the range of Birr 250bn to Birr 300bn.  
 
o Vehicle and truck imports: Vehicle and trucks imports were near Birr 30bn in FY 2017-
18, as these items are recorded explicitly in import statistics.   
 
o Land improvement: This might be approximated by federal government agriculture 
spending, which has in recent years amounted to around 10 percent of government 
expenditure.  Assuming most federal government agriculture spending is devoted to 
investment, this comes to an estimated Birr 35bn in annual land-related investments for 
FY 2017-18.  
 
• Investment by economic sector: As the national accounts classification of “industry” covers 
manufacturing, construction, and mining, we would expect most investment lies within this 
economic sub-sector.  This assumption is supported by figures for the composition of capital 
goods imports, which show that about 75 percent of capital imports are in the form of industrial 
capital goods. Extrapolating a similar share for broader economic-wide investment would imply 
industrial- related investment of near Birr 564bn. With agriculture-related investments outlays 
likely to be in the range of Birr 35bn (as derived above), this implies the residual category of 
service sector investments amounts to Birr 153bn.

• Investment by asset owner: Detailed investment data by asset owner would offer breakdowns 
by public vs private investors, residential vs non-residential investments, and foreign vs 
domestic. Again, for broad orders of magnitudes involved, available data suggest the following: 
 
o Government: The FY 2017-18 budget showed that out Birr 340bn in total government 
expenditure, Birr 144 bn was allocated for capital expenditure. By asset type, 
government’s capital spending would include infrastructure outlays, equipment 
purchases, civil works, and land improvements.   
 
o State Enterprises: Data on state enterprise capital expenditure can be inferred from 
their total use of financing from the domestic banking system and from external 
borrowing. Per NBE data, SOE use of financing (both domestic and external) was Birr 
130bn in FY 2017-18. Assuming virtually all financing is used for capital expenditure (a 
reasonable assumption) and that at least 30 percent is raised from state enterprises’ 
own resources, the total financing secured of Birr 130bn translates into total estimated 
SOE capital expenditure of around Birr 184bn. 
 
o Private Sector: Given total FY 2017-18 investment of Birr 751bn in the national accounts, 
and subtracting out the above figures for government and state enterprise capital 
spending, the estimate for private sector investment is—as a residual—around Birr 
478bn. Foreign investment of $3.7bn or Birr 100bn would be included in this sum and 
taking that out would suggest around Birr 378bn in domestic private sector investment.

Despite the patchy data, and admittedly rough nature of estimates involved, the above review 
reveals some notable observations. First, capital goods imports are actually a small share of total 
investment (Birr 144bn out of Birr 752bn, or roughly one-fifth), revealing that most infrastructure and 
civil works investments are comprised of inputs and materials sourced from domestic producers (such 
as local producers of cement and construction materials), and that a significant part of the economy’s 
investment can thus continue even if there are constraints on imported resources. Second, even after 
accounting for large state enterprise investments, the private sector is undertaking more than half of 
total investment in the economy (Birr 478bn out of Birr 751bn), despite the common impression that 
capital spending is dominated by the public sector. Third, while foreign investment is up sharply in 
recent years, it has so far been only a small part of the overall investment activity in Ethiopia, as it 
represents 13 percent of total investment (Birr 100bn out of Birr 751bn).  It has, however, grown over 
the years to make up an increasingly higher share of private investment and in FY 2017-18 reached one-
fifth of total estimated private investment (Birr 100bn out of Birr 479bn). 
Looking ahead, what do recent trends suggest about the investment outlook? We would highlight the 
following likely trends: 
 
• Overall investment to GDP: Per national accounts statistics, the investment-to-GDP ratio has 
fallen to 34 percent of GDP in 2017-18, from an average of 38 percent of GDP in the prior four 
years. While this may reflect data problems (including a revision in the base year used for GDP 
statistics), it is consistent with the lower growth recorded (just 7.7 percent last year vs 10 
percent in the prior four years) and could also reflect the political unrest in several regions of 
the country that held back public, domestic, and foreign investment activity. With conditions 
normalizing this year as well as next (a baseline assumption), the investment rate should pick 
up somewhat, though it will probably not revert back to the near-40% rate seen in 2014/15 
since we think (as elaborated in Chapter 1) there may be less resources and motivation to use 
resources for investment as opposed to consumption. We think that an investment rate in the 
mid-30s range (34-37 percent of GDP) will likely also reflect policy preferences, and this should 
be supported by large privatization proceeds (of potentially as much as 2-3 percentage points 
of GDP) as those funds are expected to be realized 2019-20 and 2020-21 and largely assumed 
to be directed for investment purposes. But beyond the impact of the privatization proceeds, 
which would take investment ratios to the upper end of the 34-37 percent range, we do not 
anticipate a big jump in the investment to GDP ratio from last year’s levels of 34 percent of GDP.   
 
• Investment composition and drivers: The composition of investment will clearly shift to private 
sector investors, and we forecast that private investment will reach close to two-thirds of total 
investment in the economy and thus stand at two-times the level of public investment. In other 
words, of the total 37 percent of GDP investment, private investment should comprise 24 
percent of GDP while public sector investment (government and state enterprises) will make up 
only around 12 percent of GDP in new investments.   Foreign investment on its own should reach 
close to a fourth of total private investment, or near 6.3 percent of GDP. Beyond the sizeable 
impact of privatization and on-going reforms, the projections for FDI will be supported by a

range of private sector equity inflows, including infrastructure-related public-private 
partnerships, industrial park inflows, mining sector ventures, power generation projects 
(including two large geo-thermal plants), oil and gas explorations, and new real estate projects 
involving solely private and joint public-private ventures.

4. When will single-digit inflation return?  
 
Key points 
 
§ We review inflation data over the past quarter century and find that single-digit inflation has 
been in place more often than not, or for 15 out of the 25 past years. We also find that average 
inflation rate over the past 25 years has been around 10.5 percent, almost identical to current 
levels. 
 
§ We expect (year-on-year) inflation to hit single-digits at end-March 2019, as month-on-month 
inflation rates have turned negative in recent months, and since price pressures should remain 
subdued for a few more months per the usual (post-harvest) seasonal norms. 
 
§ However, inflation will not fall much below the double-digit threshold for most of 2019. A 
rapid freeing of some administratively set prices, excessive monetary growth, and rising global 
oil prices could push inflation back to the mid-teens—though all three seem unlikely at the 
moment.  
 
Looking back at a quarter century of Ethiopian inflation data shows single-digit inflation has been 
more common during this time (15 out of 25 years) than double-digit inflation. Focusing on the last 
15 years, corresponding to the period of high growth, one finds that single-digit inflation has been in 
place roughly half the time, with 7 out of 15 years registering single digit inflation. And for the most 
recent period, one finds that four out of last five years registered single-digit inflation. The past 18 
months of double-digit inflation thus represents an exception rather than the norm, and indeed median 
inflation over the past 25 years as a whole has been around 9 percent. The latest available inflation 
reading shows inflation of 10.4 percent at end-December 2018, down from a 2018 peak of near 16 
percent in February 2018.9 
 
                                                        
9 The CPI index was rebased (using Dec 2016=100) on January 8, 2019 with the release of end-December 2018 inflation 
data. The new data series shows double-digit inflation for all of 2018, except for a drop to 9.3 percent in November 2018 
followed by a return to double-digit inflation in December 2018. The latter likely reflects a mid-November adjustment in 
fuel prices, which would appear in transport and related prices during December 2018.

Seen from this context, the following features of Ethiopia’s recent inflation are noteworthy: 
 
• Food rather than non-food prices:  A decomposition of inflation by type of commodity reveals 
that increases in food prices (up 11.3 percent vs year ago for December 2018) contributed more 
to inflation than non-food prices (up 9.2 percent). This is particularly important as food prices 
make up 54 percent of the price index (among the highest such ratios globally), and within this 
sub-component, cereal crops, meat, and milk/eggs explain the vast majority of food price 
movements. As those three items were precisely those registering high price increments (16.2 
percent for cereals, 17.7 percent for meat, and 14.2 percent for milk/eggs), inflation in food 
items has stayed stubbornly high.  As these products are not heavily imported and also generally 
not exported in large quantities, high domestic demand and the possible impact of domestic 
unrest has likely helped push up these price levels after five years of relatively modest annual 
increases.  
 
• Goods more than services: A split of the consumer price index along these lines indicates goods 
inflation has been higher at 11 percent (weighted average for goods) than seen for services (9.5 
percent), suggesting perhaps the effect of more competitive conditions and supply responses in 
the latter rather than the former. Services items such as health, utilities, and communications 
were notable for showing single-digit or even negative inflation.

• Imports versus domestic products: Goods with heavy import content showed inflation of 12.4 
percent, somewhat than average higher inflation rates for mainly domestically produced goods 
and services (10.2 percent). As the devaluation was 15 percent, an almost full price through to 
import prices appears to have been effected for imported goods.   
 
• Addis Ababa versus regional capitals: Inflation is somewhat lower in the capital city (10.4 
percent) than it is in regional capitals (the top 3 regions with the highest inflation showed rates 
of 14 to 21 percent), reflecting the larger weight of food within regional inflation indices. 
Transport interruptions encountered for food and other commodities, and the localized nature 
of markets in certain areas, may also explain higher inflation in the regions than in the capital.  
 
• Monetary influences: With respect to monetary policies, there is a slight indication that higher 
money supply growth may have contributed to higher inflation in FY 2017-18. Average inflation 
in the five years prior to FY 2017-18 was just 8.5 percent and money supply growth over the 
same period was lower than it has been last year—overall banking system credit (broad money) 
grew on average by 24.9 percent per year and central bank funds (reserve money) grew by 17 
percent per year. By contrast, growth in both broad money and reserve money was higher at 
29.2 percent and 19.1 percent respectively in 2017-18 when inflation rose to 14.7 percent for 
the year to June 2018. However, this simple inference is not definitive on its own as it does not 
account for other influences on inflation (including product markets and external factors).  Also, 
looking more narrowly at just government borrowing from the central bank (the most 
inflationary form of financing), growth in this line item was 18 percent in 2017-18 and not that 
different from average annual growth during the prior five years (19 percent per year on 
average), suggesting that extra inflationary pressures did not arise—within the last year—from 
this particular source. Still, some level of influence has likely been exerted from slightly higher 
money supply growth last fiscal year compared to the prior five years, and indeed inflation might 
have been somewhat lower had credit growth last year been less than actually registered.

To make a final observation on recent inflation drivers, we provide a snapshot of price level data for 
over a dozen of items with some of the highest weights in the (Addis Ababa) consumer price index. 
Data for September 2018 are used as these price level data are made available by the Central Statistical 
Agency with a few months lag. The price level data for Addis Ababa show food prices being driven by 
high increases in several widely-consumed staples such as cooking oil (61 percent), wheat barley (31 
percent), and teff (25 percent).  Prices from sources other than the Central Statistical Agency (CSA) for 
a few readily available price indicators broadly align with the CSA data, showing significant increases 
for wheat (36 percent), teff (27 percent), and maize (15 percent), which are broadly similar to the 
percent increases found in the CSA data.

Outlook 
 
The outlook for inflation this year shows a mixed picture.  Upward pressures on prices appear likely in 
areas such as transport costs (reflecting recent fuel price adjustments after nearly a year of unchanged 
prices), electricity tariffs, as well as in rental costs in governmental and private commercial and 
residential rates (for which press reports indicate significant increases in recent months). At the same 
time, downward or moderating price pressures are likely for food, given the record crop harvest and 
the continued expectation for administratively set price for key staples such as wheat, sugar, and edible 
oil. The latter three food items, which are subsidized by government and imported mainly via bulk 
government purchases, should benefit from flat to only slightly higher prices for 2019 based on IMF 
projections, suggesting limited inflation pressures from imported food prices. Finally, macro policies 
will not add upward pressure to prices in our view, as: (1) the government’s budget deficit is being 
reduced somewhat from last year; (2) the central bank has committed to a tighter monetary growth 
program for the year per indications in the IMF’s recent Article IV staff report (only 13 percent reserve 
money growth this year, vs 23 percent two years ago and 19 percent last year); and (3) broader 
monetary growth, judging by July-September banking data, has slowed somewhat in the first quarter 
of the fiscal year relative to year ago levels (both deposit and loan growth are expected to be lower this 
year compared to recent years; see Chapter 7).  
 
Focusing on inflation outturns since the start of the current fiscal year, price pressures are seen to be 
moderating, despite a slight uptick in December 2018. Cumulative inflation for the six months since 
the start of the fiscal year (July-December 2018) has been only 2.7 percent, while the first six months 
of the previous fiscal year showed 8.4 percent inflation by end-December 2017. In addition, looking at 
the most recent period, month-on-month inflation has turned negative for two of the past three 
months, in line with monthly inflation patterns over the past 25 years shows the last three months of 
the calendar year typically record negative month-on-month inflation of around 0.5 percent, reflecting 
food price developments following seasonal harvests. In 2018, month-on-month inflation for October, 
November, December was -0.31, -1.09, and +1.5 percent respectively, with the increase seen in 
December appearing to reflect the recent 8 percent fuel price adjustment.

Taken all together, we forecast inflation will fall to a single-digit level of 9 percent by end-March 
2019, and remain within 1-2 percentage points of that level (plus or minus) for the remainder of the 
year. We don’t see inflation showing any material decline below 9 percent for the rest of 2019, as the 
negative month-on-month inflation rates of the last quarter of the calendar year reverse in the January-
March period and in subsequent quarters. Reflecting the above, we expect inflation will not be far from 
the double-digit threshold for most of the year, and project year-on-year inflation at 8.6 percent as of 
June 2019 and just under 10 percent as of December 2019.

5. Have debt levels become worrisome? 
 
Key points 
 
§ Ethiopia’s public-sector debt-to-GDP ratio of near 60 percent is not out-of-line with the norm 
seen in many African countries, and its composition shows that roughly half of the total is in 
the form of low-cost domestic debt. At the same time, repayments on external debt have 
reached $1.5bn per year and thus become quite high relative to reserves and to exports. 
Ethiopia’s public sector is thus currently facing more of a debt servicing challenge—linked to 
several years of weak exports and a bunching up of repayment dues—rather than a debt 
sustainability problem. 
 
§ Private debt is only around 17 percent of GDP, or less than one-third the size of public debt; 
while the latter has limited scope for growth, there is plenty of room to grow for the former. 
 
§ For the first time ever, foreign equity inflows (FDI) surpassed foreign debt inflows in 2017 and 
this was repeated again in 2018. The increasing substitution of equity with debt should ease 
debt sustainability going forward even if goods exports don’t pick up as fast as expected. 
Rising remittances and grants—both of which should get a lift from recent reforms—will 
further ease debt concerns.  
 
Ethiopia’s public sector debt has risen 16.5x in the past decade, reaching Birr 1.3 trillion as of June 
2018 from Birr 371bn five years ago and Birr 80 bn ten years ago. Expressed in USD terms, public sector 
debt has reached $48bn as of June 2018, up from $19.9bn five years ago and $8.3bn a decade ago. This 
total public debt figure includes borrowing from external and domestic lenders and also covers the debt 
of both government and state enterprises. As of mid-2018, slightly more than half of public sector debt 
was owed to external lenders ($25.9bn or around Birr 706bn) while the remainder was debt owed to 
domestic lenders, mostly to the state-owned commercial bank and pension funds.  A summary of this 
increase, by public sector entity (central government vs state enterprises) and by lender (foreign vs 
domestic) is presented in Table 5.1.

Within the public sector, both the federal government and state enterprises have accumulated debt 
at a roughly equal pace over the past five years. Central government debt rose nearly two-fold in the 
past five years, from $13.9bn to $25.8bn, while state enterprises showed a nearly identical doubling of 
debt levels from $11.9bn to $22.8bn. By borrowing sources, domestic debt accumulation (1.9x in the 
last five years) was slightly higher than external debt accumulation (1.8x over the same period). A 
snapshot of the trends in the public sector debt accumulation by entity and by source is provided in 
Table 5.2. 
 
 
 
Though the nominal increases in public sector debt are substantial, with nominal GDP increasing nine-
fold over the past ten years (from Birr 245bn to Birr 2,202bn), Ethiopia’s debt-to-GDP is not out of 
line with the seen norm in many African countries or emerging market economies. The total public-
debt to GDP ratio of around 58 percent is nearly identical to the 56 percent average seen for all African 
countries (excluding Nigeria and South Africa) and not that different from ratios seen in countries such 
as Kenya (56%), South Africa (55%), Vietnam (58%), and Mexico (54%). Finally, looking at the ratio of 
the NPV of debt to GDP—the more relevant ratio for a country that has a lot of concessional debt—one 
sees an even better picture (just 50 percent of GDP) than suggested by the simple nominal debt to GDP 
ratios (see the IMF’s December 2018 Debt Sustainability Assessment). The fact that about half of public 
sector debt is secured from low-cost domestic debt (unusual among most African and emerging market 
economies and possible thanks to state-directed financial sector policies) further limits the country’s 
overall public sector debt burden.

While debt-to-GDP ratios thus do not stand out when compared to peers, one part of the debt 
increase that has become comparatively high is the external debt stock when seen relative to exports 
(a measure of all future repayment obligations) as well as the annual principal and interest 
repayments relative to exports (a measure of current debt servicing burdens). Focusing just on 
external public sector debt, annual debt service dues have risen from USD 77mn ten years ago to USD 
666mn five years ago and USD 1,530 mn for the year that ended in June 2018. The corresponding debt-
to-exports figure has jumped substantially, from 8.5 percent to 18.3 percent to 24 percent over this 
period, even using an export denominator that includes both goods and services exports. The size of 
the public sector external debt stock relative to foreign reserves has also risen sharply, from 2.9x a 
decade ago to 4.7x five years ago and 8.6x as of June 2018. It is largely this deterioration in ratios of 
debt repayment capacity that has been behind the change in the country’s debt burden assessment by 
the IMF, which in January 2018 and December 2018 concluded their debt sustainability assessment 
with a “high risk” of debt distress as Ethiopia exceeded the applicable thresholds of 180 percent for 
debt-to-exports and 20 percent for debt service-to-exports. 
 
 
 
Outlook 
 
Looking ahead, and given recent reforms, will the debt burden become a major impediment that 
holds back growth? We think not, as several very recent initiatives point to a moderation in new debt 
accumulation and since we also forecast a strengthening of the country’s capacity to service external 
debt (i.e., debt ratios will benefit from a slower increase in the numerator and a large expansion in the 
denominator).  As nominal GDP should continue growing strongly (by near 20 percent per year in 
nominal Birr terms and close to 10 percent per year in USD terms even with some annual depreciation), 
this allows for some continued debt accumulation without a deterioration in debt-to-GDP ratios. 
Indeed, debt of around $2bn to $3bn on its own does not worsen debt-to-GDP ratios given the rise in

the dollar GDP denominator. But in any case, new debt accumulation will be moderated on account of 
large-scale privatization, a shift towards use of PPPs in large infrastructure projects, and the avoidance 
of borrowing on non-concessional terms (i.e., at market interest rates).  
 
Regarding debt servicing capacity, the combination of recent reforms and some recent bilateral 
agreements have limited near-term risks in this area. Most notably, temporary financing has been 
secured to boost reserves from bilateral sources while a rescheduling of Chinese debt has reportedly 
stretched out near-term repayments over 30 years.10 But perhaps most important, the advent of 
broader reforms in Ethiopia has boosted remittance inflows sharply this year: data to June 2018 showed 
remittance inflows up 16 percent from the year before and annual inflows of $5bn, while the state 
banks (the largest conduit for remittance flows) has recently reported a record $ 1bn remittance inflows 
for the first quarter of the current fiscal year. Indeed, including remittance inflows, debt servicing 
capacity does not at all present serious risks, but remittances are not included in the calculation of the 
IMF’s debt distress ratings, and accordingly debt service ratios (based on debt-service to exports of 
goods and services) reached 24 percent for the coming fiscal year and triggered a “high risk” of debt 
distress rating.  With the inclusion of remittances, this ratio falls to 13 percent, a manageable level and 
one that would qualify for a moderate rating.11  
 
Moving beyond the public sector, the size of Ethiopia’s private sector debt levels are worth noting, 
as these are still comparatively low and show plenty of room to grow. Ethiopia’s private sector credit 
to GDP ratio is still at a low base and can easily grow by over 30 percent per year over the coming years.   
 
• Private debt owed to domestic lenders: The total borrowing of private firms and households 
from the banking system is currently Birr 328bn billion, up nearly three-fold from five years ago. 
(Table 5.5). This figure of Birr 328bn is part of Birr 1,056bn in total domestic debt of government, 
state enterprises and the private sector, pointing to a one-third share of the private sector in 
total domestic credit.  Relative to GDP, private sector debt stands at just 17 percent and the 
number of borrowers in the banking system (currently only around 250,000) remains low—both 
of which point to large scope for future growth.  The NPL ratio at private banks (the source of 
most private debt) is around 2-3 percent, suggesting negligible debt burdens for private 
borrowers in the aggregate.  From a cross-country perspective, private sector credit-to-GDP is 
in the 40-50 percent range in many other African countries (including Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, 
and Egypt) which provides further indication of the large room for expansion in this area.  
 
• Private sector debt owed to foreign lenders: In recent years, private firms have increasingly 
been able to borrow from abroad, especially with a more flexible policy by the central bank to 
                                                        
10 The IMF’s December 2018 Article IV paper reports $1bn in foreign exchange deposits placed at the NBE from the UAE, 
while press reports from September 2018 indicate a rescheduling of $4bn in railway-related Chinese loans, with maturities 
streched out from 10 to 30 years (a large savings in NPV terms based on some reasonable assumption for discount rates).  
11 The inclusion of remittances is as justified as including services exports in the basis for using repayment capacity—both 
are recurring current accounts inflow that provide fx resources to help meet annual principal and interest obligations.

allow such private borrowing in the case of exporters, large domestic corporates, and foreign 
companies. Within the past year, suppliers’ credits from foreign sellers have also been 
accommodated more generously to assist companies in securing key raw materials or 
equipment. The size of foreign borrowing by private sector companies (judging by the difference 
between total external debt and public debt reported in the IMF’s debt sustainability reports) 
has gone up from $1.7bn to $2.1bn in the past five years, and is now close to 2.5 percent of 
GDP. At Birr 55bn when expressed in local currency terms, the amount of foreign debt taken on 
by the private sector is thus already around one-seventh of total private sector debt of Birr 
385bn. Most of this private external debt is likely to be facing market interest rates, but this 
should not pose serious risks as the financing secured by the borrowing companies is typically 
for growth and expansion capital, allowing them to cover repayments over time.  
 
 
 
In sum, with a slowdown in state enterprise borrowing plus strong prospects for a balance of 
payments improvement on the back of large privatizations and a set of more orthodox 
macroeconomic reforms, the picture that emerges is of an improving debt and debt servicing outlook.  
As elaborated above, our view is that thanks to the current set of macro/structural reforms being put 
in place and in light of the gradual projected improvements in fx inflows, key debt and debt-servicing 
ratios are broadly manageable. Perhaps the strongest indicator of this is that both market assessments 
and forward-looking indicators of Ethiopia’s debt position do not suggest any serious concerns in this 
area: the three global ratings (Standard and Poor’s, Fitch, and Moody’s) agencies have maintained their 
B/B/B1 ratings for Ethiopia throughout 2017 and 2018, while Ethiopia’s sovereign bond—the country’s 
only such instrument traded in global capital markets— has not shown a widening of spreads beyond 
what was seen for emerging markets as a whole in 2018.12   
 
                                                        
12 Yields on Ethiopia’s sovereign bond have risen to 6.9 percent as of end-2018, up from around 5.7-5.9 percent at end-
2017.  However, this 1 percentage-point increase in is in line with the yield increases seen for emerging markets in 2018 and 
does not show any increased Ethiopia-specific risk assessment by the holders of Ethiopia’s sovereign bonds. A yield of 6.9 
percent (effectively the interest rate that Ethiopia would face if borrowing from global capital markets at this time) is also

propelled by major branch expansions and several national savings schemes. Relative to the 
size of the economy, total deposits at banks are now 33 percent of GDP and, excluding 
checking accounts, savings deposits alone are 21 percent of GDP.  
 
§ As measured in the national accounts, domestic savings is now 24 percent of GDP, up from 18 
percent of GDP five years ago and 9 percent a decade ago. Of total domestic savings, around 
97 percent is contributed by the private sector, per IMF breakdowns. Despite limited per 
capita incomes, large segments of the population have thus been able to sacrifice substantial 
shares (almost a quarter) of their incomes.  
 
§ Looking ahead, expecting higher savings rates from the private sector may no longer be 
feasible or desirable. The scope for boosting private domestic savings, at least relative to GDP, 
may also be limited in other ways: cash circulating outside banks is not very significant from 
a macro perspective and recent savings schemes can no longer benefit from one-off gains 
(such as the start of the private pension scheme). Given all this, sustaining a high investment 
rate will only be possible by boosting savings from the public sector and/or from foreign 
sources. 
 
Financial savings as measured by bank deposits have shown a dramatic expansion over the past 
decade—though more so in nominal terms rather than relative to GDP. Key metrics illustrating this 
increase are shown in Table 6.1 below, showing most notably that, over a ten year time-frame, bank 
deposits are up 11.6-fold (from Birr 63 billion to 730 bn, or from 26 to 33 percent of GDP), bank branches 
are up 8.5-fold (from 562 to 4,757), and the number of depositors is up 9.5-fold (from 3.5 million to 
33.4 million). The rise in domestic savings has been driven by a combination of factors that include 
geographical expansion of bank branches (around 3,080 of the 4,757 branches are outside the capital 
city); aggressive bank mobilization efforts; public and private pension savings schemes; housing savings 
schemes; and other public savings schemes such as those for the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. 
 
                                                        
still quite favorable when seen against end-2018 yields for USD bonds of sovereigns such as Kenya (7.9%), Egypt (7.4%), 
Namibia (7.4%), Senegal (7.2%, and South Africa (6.9%).

The decomposition of the sources of deposit growth shows that the private sector has been and 
remains the largest contributor, making up 75 percent of total deposits in the banking system.  The 
private sector’s deposits have become more important over the past ten years (it is up somewhat from 
a 70 percent share in 2008), thus contributing importantly in the domestic savings build-up. The second 
largest saving contributors—as measured by bank deposits—are public enterprises/agencies (whose 
share is up from 8 to 12 percent over the last ten years), while government deposits make up the third 
largest share at 8 percent of deposits in the banking system as of June 2018.

The growth in savings as measured by banking deposits is broadly reflected in other monetary figures 
and in national accounts savings data, though with some notable variance in magnitudes involved. 
Money supply—which is comprised of currency in circulation plus deposits and alternatively know as 
broad money—is up from Birr 68bn to 741 bn between 2008 and 2018 (a 10.6x increase), or from 28 to 
34 percent over the same period when expressed relative to GDP.  This is roughly in line with the rise 
in banking sector deposits, which are up from 26 to 33 percent when expressed relative to GDP. These 
shifts suggest some financial deepening, but not to a substantial degree. However, national accounts 
data for domestic savings, point to a much sharper increase that suggests a jump in savings (if well-
measured) from a very low of 9 percent of GDP ten years ago to around 18 percent of GDP five years 
ago and 24 percent of GDP in FY 2017-18. In addition, per the IMF breakdown of national accounts-
based savings figures (see Article IV Report), most of Ethiopia’s domestic savings—97 percent— 
represents private as opposed to public sector savings. 
 
Cash circulating outside the banking system has fallen sharply relative to GDP, further suggesting a 
greater placement of funds at banks rather than ‘under mattresses’.  Trends in currency with the 
public show a decline over the past ten years, from 7 percent of GDP to 4 percent of GDP and from 17 
to 9 percent of total banking sector assets. While this would (in other countries) often reflect a move 
to digital/electronic payments, given that this space is still in its infancy in Ethiopia, we take the decline 
in the relative share of the public’s cash holdings as an indication that most funds not needed for daily 
transactions have increasingly been absorbed as deposits by the banking system.  At 4 percent of GDP, 
cash in public circulation is in line with amounts that would be reasonably be expected to be held for 
day-to-day transactional purposes.  
 
Outlook 
 
While the overall record of deposit mobilization and financial deepening has thus been broadly 
positive and impressive, the scope for future expansion in domestic savings (relative to GDP) is likely 
to be much more constrained. In particular, some of the contributing factors that propelled past 
savings increases cannot be fully replicated and, in any case, it may not be desirable to push for 
significantly more private sector savings beyond the high level (24 percent of GDP) now suggested by 
national income statistics. Elaborating further on these points:  
 
• Private savings have likely plateaued: Given the already big jump in domestic savings rates 
relative to GDP, we expect that a further expansion relative to GDP will be difficult to achieve 
for several reasons. As noted above, currency outside the banking system (i.e., funds not yet 
captured for bank intermediation) is at low levels and this suggests limited room for extra gains 
by geographic or aggressive bank-based expansion. In addition, part of the boost to recent 
savings is unlikely to yield as much gains as in the past, since it partly reflected one-off gains 
(such as getting all private employees to join into a pension scheme) or exceptional fund-raising 
schemes for high-profile mega-projects. Others saving schemes—such as for public 
condominiums—could also produce slower gains to the extent that the delivery record on these

51 
projects has lagged in recent years, discouraging current and future savers. Thus, while private 
savings could continue to increase in nominal terms (by as much as 10-15 percent per year) 
alongside rising incomes, this will not show up as a rise relative to GDP given nominal GDP 
growth rates of 20-plus percent on an annual basis.  
 
• Consumption vs Saving: In terms of the feasibility of further boosting savings relative to GDP, 
expecting the private sector—already saving a quarter of its income—to sacrifice further 
consumption could become increasingly unrealistic. At Ethiopia’s low average per capita income 
levels, a 24 percent savings rate is already a high achievement and sacrificing a such a material 
share of income for savings is not common among countries with similar income levels.  
 
With domestic savings thus constrained for the coming years, and likely to remain flat (or fall 
somewhat) as a share of GDP, what other sources of financial savings could maintain high investment 
and high growth? The alternatives are domestic public sector saving and/or foreign resources/savings. 
The former would not provide much incremental resources, in our view, given the challenges of 
maintaining a primary budget surplus in the current economic environment and the likelihood that any 
potential gains in revenue mobilization in the coming years will most likely flow into equivalent 
increases in recurrent public spending.  The most promising prospect must thus be taken to lie with 
external savings, or financial resources from the rest of the world in all their forms: remittances, private 
grants, official grants, FDI, and loans. In the most recent fiscal year, the inflows of such foreign savings 
were down to around 10 percent of GDP, judging by the gap between investment and domestic savings 
reported in FY 2017-18 GDP statistics.  This figure could realistically rise to 13-15 percent of GDP or 
more with substantially higher inflows from several of the external resources itemized above. Indeed, 
based again on national income accounts, foreign savings was as high as 15-18 percent of GDP in 
Ethiopia looking back five and ten years ago (reflecting proportionally higher external transfers and a 
much smaller GDP), but this ratio has fallen sharply over time and the burden of covering domestic 
investment was thus carried increasingly by domestic savings.  Just partially reversing this trend in the 
use of foreign resources/savings (i.e., moving its ratio towards the mid-teens relative to GDP) and—
importantly—making greater use of private transfers and equity rather than primarily debt inflows 
could thus provide incremental savings of 3 to 5 percent of GDP, allowing for continued high investment 
rates without sacrificing either growth of domestic consumption.

7. Will banking keep booming? 
 
Key points 
 
§ The banking sector has been in the midst of a booming environment for the past decade, 
marked by 28 percent annual deposit growth, 31 percent annual lending growth, 22 percent 
annual profit growth, and shareholder returns—at private banks—that averaged 33 percent 
per year during this period.  
 
§ High growth and high profits were driven in part by the fast-growing macroeconomy, but also 
reflected favorable (for the banks) net interest margins, fx-related fees, and cost-to-income 
ratios.  Despite some likely pressure on these operational metrics in the coming years, we 
project that the profit pool of Ethiopian banks will soon reach close to $1 billion (around Birr 
28bn), while average earnings per share will fall somewhat but remain above 25 percent per 
year, by our calculations.  
 
§ Growth opportunities for Ethiopian banks will come from moves into untapped funding 
sources (bank bond issues, foreign borrowing), untapped lending spaces (consumer lending, 
credit cards, SME loans), digital products and payments, and capital markets related services 
when reforms in this area eventually bring bond and equity markets.  All of the above would 
boost financial access and inclusion, while enabling the sector to serve as a well-functioning 
‘circulatory system’ needed for a private-sector driven economy.  
 
The banking sector has shown strong deposit, lending, capital, and profit growth without almost any 
interruption for the past 20 years. Key elements of this growth are documented below for the past ten 
years, revealing a 11.6x rise in deposits, a 14.4x rise in loans, a 8.7x rise in capital, and 6.7x rise in profits 
over the past decade. The pace of growth between public and private banks has been broadly similar, 
though the latter have taken a somewhat larger share in deposits (from 32 to 38 percent) over the past 
five years. Though nominal growth in these banking metrics is impressive, it is worth noting that with 
GDP growth also quite high in the Ethiopian context, the overall size of banking assets to GDP has risen 
more moderately from 44 to 45 percent over the past decade. Over the same period, deposits are up 
from 26 to 33 percent of GDP, total credit is up from 21 to 33 percent of GDP, and banks’ capital is 
largely unchanged, declining from 4.0 to 3.9 percent of GDP.

Driving banks’ impressive growth has been their ability to gather and deploy two key financial 
resources—public deposits and foreign exchange.  On deposits, public and private banks have 
collectively raised their branch network from 562 ten years ago and 2,208 five years ago to 4,757 
branches as of June 2018.  In parallel with the rising deposits, depositor numbers have jumped from 4 
million in 2010 to 10 million five years ago to 33 million today—equivalent to perhaps on one half of 
the adult population. CBE alone has mobilized 15 million customers through a service network that 
covers virtually all corners of the country (1,375 branches, 1,708 ATMs, and 11,796 POS machines) and 
multiple user channels (4.4 million card users and 1.7 million mobile banking customers).  The 
expanding reach of banks is also seen among the private banks, with some of the largest private banks 
each now surpassing a network of over 380 branches, 2 million customers, above 300 ATMs, nearly 
1,000 POS devices, and above 700,000 card users. 
 
For a given stock of mobilized resources, Ethiopian banks have stood out for being able to effectively 
deploy virtually all of these resources given an environment of high demand for credit and foreign 
exchange.  In recent years, the loan-to-deposit ratio at banks reached as high as 109 percent, after 
accounting for the 5 percent mandatory reserve requirement and the bond/bill holdings of CBE and 
private banks. (The loan-to-deposit ratio can exceed 100 percent since banks can also lend out some 
portion of their capital base).  On the foreign exchange side, all mobilized foreign exchange funds are 
able to be sold immediately given excess demand for foreign exchange and, precisely for this reason, 
inter-bank foreign exchange trading is virtually non-existent among banks as sales to end-customers 
can  be immediately effected. The ability to quickly intermediate mobilized resources has thus been 
one key basis for banks’ strong growth.

Looking more broadly at the sources of banks’ high growth and high profits, this has also reflected 
key operational ratios that have worked in banks’ favour for many years. The three most relevant 
operational metrics in this context have been banks’ net interest margins, fx-related fees, and cost-to-
income ratios.  
 
• Net interest margins: With average lending rates at 11.9 percent and average deposit rates at 
4.5 percent, banks enjoy a spread of around 7.5 percent on average. The high lending rate 
reflects average loan rates of 14-18 percent for most (non-export) loans and rates of 8.5-10 
percent for export or priority customers. On the deposit side, despite a minimum 7 percent 
interest rate that must be paid on savings deposits, the effective deposit rate paid by banks on 
their total deposits is actually 4.5 percent given their ability to attract non-interest paying 
accounts (checking deposits), which in 2017-18 comprised on average 27 percent of total 
deposits across private banks. For each Birr 1 billion in deposits mobilized, banks thus stand to 
earn as much as Birr 75 million in net interest income (though this is reduced by a 5 percent 
reserve requirement on deposits and the mandatory purchase of NBE Bills for 27 percent of 
gross loan disbursements).   
 
• Fx intermediation fees: Fees for opening Letters of Credits (L/Cs), which averaged 1 to 2 
percent at most private banks about ten years ago, and 3 to 4 percent five years ago, are now 
between 6 and 7.5 percent at most private banks. Such fees are exceptionally high in a cross-
country context, with the banks’ high pricing power arising due to tight fx conditions and excess 
demand for foreign exchange.  Thus, on the fx side of banks business, for each USD 100 million 
in foreign exchange inflows collected from customers, banks stand to earn nearly Birr 200 
million in non-interest revenue (though this is again reduced somewhat by regulatory 
requirements that call for a surrender of 30 percent of fx inflows to the central bank).      
 
• Cost-to-income ratios: Low employee costs (especially when put in a global/regional context), 
the use of typically simple branch facilities, limited IT expenses for most of the past ten years, 
and low NPLs/provisions have collectively allowed banks to maintain low cost-to-income ratios 
of just 41 percent in recent years, compared to the 60-65 percent ratio seen in most other 
African and emerging market economies.  
 
Taking into account the key operational metrics of banks more formally (via a Dupont Analysis), one 
observes that the biggest source of profitability has been provided by high net interest margins, 
reflecting in part the traditional dominance of credit intermediation activities at Ethiopian banks. For 
the sector as a whole, net interest income was—for 2018—a high 4.9 percent of assets while non-
interest revenue was just 3.7 percent of assets, leading to a combined revenue of 8.6 percent of assets 
from all income sources. Lending activity, thus contributed about 57 percent of total income, on 
average, for private banks. With low operational costs around of 4.7 percent of assets and negligible 
provision costs (0.2 percent of assets), profits after taxess amounted to 2.8 percent of average assets.

As leverage (assets to total capital) was around 7.4x, this implied returns on average equity of 20.2 
percent (i.e. 2.8 times 7.4), and an industry average earnings per share—given total capital was 1.5x 
shareholder capital—of 31 percent (i.e., 20.2 times 1.5).  
 
Reflecting the above factors, returns to bank shareholders have remained high in recent years, 
though they are down by roughly one-fifth from their peak levels registered in 2010. Taken 
collectively, private banks as a whole have seen the average earnings per share fall from a peak of 39 
percent in 2010 to 36 percent in 2013 to 31 percent in 2018. The highest EPS performance dropped 
from 61 to 43 percent over this period. Reflecting competitive dynamics within the industry, the six 
older private banks have seen falling EPS ratios (from 46 to 35 percent between 2010 and 2018), while 
the newer 10 banks have collectively seen a rise in EPS ratios from 23 to 28 percent during the same 
period. 
 
 
 
Qualitatively, growth in banking has been driven by some degree of product and service innovation. 
For example, the scope of deposit and lending services has broadened with new offerings such as 
tailored accounts (premium accounts, youth/women accounts, interest-free products) and specialized 
loan offerings (interest-free products, diaspora loans, and limited consumer loans). Digital initiatives 
and offerings in recent years have included a wide expansion in ATM services (now offered by all banks 
and—importantly—electronically interconnected among the different banks), POS devices at 
merchants, and different forms of mobile banking and/or mobile wallet services.

Outlook 
 
Looking ahead, the outlook for the banking sector will be dependent, in the first instance, on trends 
for the two key financial resources that drive their growth (deposits and fx) and, to a secondary 
degree, by trends in bank-specific operating ratios such as interest margins, fees, costs, and capital 
base. More specifically:  
 
• Macro outlook (deposit and fx resources): Deposit growth has averaged 28 percent over the 
past ten years and never fallen below 19 percent in even the slowest year. Deposit growth rates 
in the low 20s percent range is very likely for many more years to come, mainly in line with 
nominal GDP growth projections and even if deposit-to-GDP ratios were just to stay flat at 
current levels. For foreign exchange resources, the balance of payments outlook is much more 
positive for this year and next and aggregate fx inflows are expected to rise by 20-25 percent 
each year per our projections (see Chapter 10), which should translate to rising fee-based 
income for banks with large fx-related businesses.  
 
• Micro outlook (bank-specific operating ratios): With respect to net interest margins, we expect 
a modest decline in the next year or two, as banks have become unexpectedly liquid in the past 
two quarters (July-December 2018) and will be keen to deploy their idle funds for some income 
generation. Given the mandatory minimum interest rate of 7 percent for savings deposits, a 
reduction in lending rates will necessarily reduce net interest margins, though banks can also 
stop accepting high-cost time deposits and we thus only expect a modest decline from current 
rates of about 7 percent to 5.0-5.5 percent. For non-interest revenue, namely fees on fx 
intermediation and on various bank guarantees, we don’t see any pressures for a reduction in 
an environment of foreign exchange constraints (see Chapter 9), and banks are thus likely to be 
able to maintain current fees in the current policy environment (a Birr float would sharply 
reduce these fees as excess demand for foreign exchange is eliminated). Finally, on cost-to-
income ratios, this is likely to rise materially (from unusually low bases at most banks) given 
emerging expense lines at most banks related to IT modernization, headquarter building 
projects, and rising rents and salaries in the sector; however, with strong growth in income, 
banks can bear higher incremental costs without much deterioration in cost-to-income ratios so 
we would not expect an increase of more than a few percentage points. 
 
• Leverage: The ability to multiply returns from a relatively small capital base will be more limited 
as capital raising requirements will imply large percentage increases in capital in the coming 
years. Thus, while private banks’ leverage (assets to total capital) has been rising in recent years 
(from 5.7x two years ago to 7.4x as of June 2018, on a weighted-average basis), which helped 
boost shareholder returns, we expect leverage ratios will stay broadly flat from here on, 
providing less support to projected EPS figures.

Putting all of the above assumptions into a simple model for the Ethiopian banking system we project 
a somewhat reduced (but still-high) earnings per share for the industry as a whole. On the plus side, 
the sector will benefit from still strong growth in resource mobilization (deposits and foreign exchange), 
but this is offset by forecast trends in key operational ratios that will work to reduce shareholder returns 
(net interest margin, cost-to-income ratios, and lower leverage). Of course, as in the past, the 
distribution of performance around the average can be quite varied, with the best performers—based 
on 2017-18 results—typically showing 2x the industry average EPS and the lowest performers showing 
0.6x the industry average. Active competition in the areas of deposit mobilization, fx generation, and 
operating efficiency will thus remain—as before—a key source of differences in shareholder returns 
across banks. 
 
 
 
Finally, from a qualitative and service offerings perspective, Ethiopian banks should increasingly be 
expected to move into previously untapped or under-exploited areas. Such growth opportunities 
would include a move into untapped funding sources (bank bond issues, foreign borrowing), untapped 
lending spaces (consumer lending, credit cards, SME loans), digital products and payments, and capital 
markets related service offerings when reforms in this area eventually bring bond and equity markets. 
These emerging spaces represent a large expansion in the universe of Ethiopia’s financing sources, 
instruments, and users. Entry into these areas is thus an attractive proposition for banks in its own right, 
but also critical for the sector to serve as a well-functioning ‘circulatory system’ needed in a private-
sector driven economy.

8. Is the financial sector opening soon? 
 
Key points 
 
§ We don’t anticipate the financial sector opening up to foreign banks soon, and certainly not 
before 2020. This is not as big a handicap as it is often made out to be, in our view, since 
foreign bank entry is not a magic bullet that would do away with fx and credit constraints in 
the banking system.  
 
§ While there may not be an opening to foreign banks, there will clearly be an opening of the 
financial sector in other ways, as the Government’s publicly announced policy commitments 
explicitly include the launch of capital markets by 2020.  
 
§ The launch of debt and equity markets will most likely focus—at least in the beginning—on 
domestic rather than foreign investors, but this could soon be broadened to include the latter 
for certain limited sub-categories of financial and related services.  
 
Ethiopia is one of the few economies in the world where the financial sector is closed to foreign 
investors.  The restriction to foreign banks is—in some respects—not surprising as the financial sector 
has been designed to be state-led in line with the adopted development model, was only opened to 
the domestic private sector around two decades ago, and has until recently involved very traditional 
and regulated forms of banking that may not have attracted much foreign interest in the first place. In 
addition, policymakers have, in the past, routinely attributed restrictions of foreign investors to 
concerns about the regulatory capacity to exercise oversight over foreign-owned banks.  
 
Being closed off from the rest of the world has no doubt slowed the degree of innovation in the 
financial sector, but it is also worth noting that the adopted economic development model has been 
as important in limiting the range of product and service offerings.  For example, the scarcity of foreign 
exchange is often (mistakenly) attributed to the lack of foreign banks, but there really is no necessary 
connection: fx supplies are determined by balance of payments developments and broader financial 
sector policies, and the capital injection that a few foreign banks might bring is in no way of a material 
size compared to the size of the broader macroeconomy (minimum capital requirements are Birr 2bn 
or $71mn, equivalent to a few days worth of imports). Similarly, the under-development of certain 
services such as credit cards, digital finance, consumer loans, and the like is seen to reflect the absence 
of foreign banks, but regulations and macro conditions are actually more important factors (i.e. credit 
cards are not yet permitted, regulations for digital finance remain somewhat restrictive, and banks have 
few long-term liabilities so cannot offer much in the way of long-term consumer credit).  Still, with 
gradual regulatory reform and an increasingly competitive private banking environment, service 
offerings increasingly becoming modernized in line with international standards. Among other things, 
the past few years have brought a broader range of deposits accounts, loan offerings, interest-free

61 
banking options and widespread use of alternative and electronic banking channels such as ATMs, Point 
of Sales (POS) devices, internet banking, and mobile banking.  
 
While generally closed, small pockets of the financial sector are—it should be noted—already open 
to foreign investors. This includes capital leasing and fin-tech platforms that work in collaboration with 
banks and micro-finance institutions. At least two institutions are engaged in the latter, through the 
provision of mobile wallet and related services, while the capital leasing space has yet to attract a 
foreign investor.  
 
Outlook 
 
While an opening of the financial sector to foreign banks is not imminent, in our view, recent policy 
announcements point to financial sector opening in other ways.  Most notably, per the Prime 
Minister’s Office’s recent “New Horizon of Hope” strategy summary, capital markets are to be in place 
by 2020. Based on other recent policy plans (see Government’s Letter of Development Policy in recent 
World Bank loan package), this would be starting with the launch of market-based government 
securities and (we presume) followed by the eventual establishment of private bond and equity 
markets. These openings would represent a new chapter in Ethiopia’s financial sector history, perhaps 
as significant as the opening to private sector banks some two decades ago.  
 
An opening up of capital markets would considerably expand the universe of financing sources, 
instruments, and users. Breaking down the two broad areas of anticipated reform, we would note the 
following: 
 
• Debt: An early start on the debt side, as noted above, would include the issuance of government 
securities at market-based rates, in an amount equivalent to 10 percent of the government’s 
annual  domestic financing needs (per recent World Bank loan document). With deficits of near 
3.0 percent of GDP, and assuming domestic borrowing covers half of government financing 
needs, the amounts of new marketable government debt securities will be modest at first but 
could rise substantially over time.  Beyond the launch of such marketable securities by 
Government, an openness to similar debt instruments could soon bring the issuance of private 
company bonds to domestic investors and the issuance of long-term bonds by private banks to 
domestic investors. Broadening the scope of debt instruments even further to foreign debt 
sources, one might expect further openness towards private company borrowings from foreign 
lenders (this has started already, but larger users and amounts would be possible), as well as 
bank borrowing from abroad for (long-term) fx-denominated loans that could be on-lent to local 
(fx-generating) businesses for equally long-term durations.   
 
• Equity: On the equity side, the major opening in this space would be the issuance of state 
enterprise shares to foreign and domestic investors, as part of the partial privatization of the 
four big state firms (airlines, telecom, power, logistics) and the full privatization of other

62 
upcoming cases.  As highlighted in Chapter 1, the scope of potential inflows in this area, even 
using some crude comparison to similar companies in other markets, suggests magnitudes in 
the range of $9-13bn over several years. Privatization related equity raising could be expected 
to be supplemented by private company share issuance to domestic investors, i.e., a stock 
market. The practice of private share issuance is, of course, already in place for dozens of firms 
(most notably for Ethiopia’s 16 private banks and 16 insurance companies), but the difference 
with an organized capital market would be the use of readily traded marketable securities 
whose prices move regularly in line with firm performance and market conditions/sentiment. 
Broadening the scope of equity reform further (and making a more speculative judgement) it is 
possible that some degree of individual—as opposed to institutional—foreign minority equity 
participation in private Ethiopian banks might also be entertained by policymakers, which would 
address long-standing diaspora demands and serve as an easy means of boosting foreign 
exchange supplies. With several flagship state enterprises soon to have minority foreign 
shareholders of as much as 49 percent, it is possible that a similar openness to minority 
(individual) foreign share-holdings at private banks may not encounter much regulatory 
resistance in the period ahead. 
 
Given the considerations above, what orders of magnitude might be involved for Ethiopia’s emerging 
debt and equity markets? Looking at the two main components: 
 
• On the debt side, a market in government securities would amount to just under Birr 10bn in 
the first two years ($350mn at current exchange rates), based on budget deficits of near 3 
percent of GDP and half of total financing being met by domestic borrowing in both 2020 and 
2021. For bond issues by domestic corporates, this could also reach almost Birr 10bn assuming, 
say, 20-30 private corporate issues over two years in average amounts of near Birr 300mn each 
(smaller amounts would not warrant bond issues but instead be covered by bank debt). Adding 
in potential bond issues by financial institutions could add a similar Birr 10bn under some 
plausible assumptions (say, 8 banks issuing bonds equivalent to around 30 percent of their 
capital base). Collectively, domestic debt securities could thus reach close to Birr 30bn within 
the space of a few years.  
 
• On the equity side, putting aside the large privatizations, a reasonable estimation would be that 
around 20-30 large private corporates (a figure that amounts to just 5 percent of the number of 
Large Tax-payers, per ERCA classifications) and 32 financial institutions (counting all banks and 
insurance companies) might move towards listing on a domestic stock market in the initial three 
years. This would imply a stock market with over 50 members and a market valuation—based 
on some comparable price-to-earning and price-to-book value ratios—of as much as Birr 270bn 
or $9bn at current exchange rates (see Table 8.1). Relative to the economy’s size, this would 
place the stock market size at around 6 percent of 2021-22 GDP for Ethiopia—a small share that 
points to the still limited size of Ethiopia’s private sector compared to countries with long head-
starts in this area such as Egypt (15% of GDP stock market capitalization at end-2018),

Bangladesh (16%), Tanzania (18%), Pakistan (19%), Ghana (21%), Kenya (26%), Indonesia (42%), 
Vietnam (76%), and South Africa (over 300%). However, adding in the large state-owned 
privatizations and assuming their equity shares would be listed on any future stock market could 
more than double this figure, potentially taking stock market capitalization to the range of 15-
20 percent of GDP within the course of a few years.

9. When could foreign exchange availability start improving? 
 
Key points 
 
§ Foreign exchange availability has been among the major business challenges facing 
investors—domestic and foreign alike—over the past few years.  
 
§ FX availability for businesses could improve ‘with the stroke of a pen’ were the central bank 
to switch its policies to allow the Birr to float freely. Such a sudden switch in the fx policy 
regime is one of two possible approaches that could address foreign exchange shortages, and 
we think it could actually be done with little risk and limited adverse impacts (not to mention 
major positive spill-overs). 
 
§ As we see it, however, policy preferences remain tilted towards a second—more gradual—
route for fx reform.  Accordingly, while not ruling out policymakers’ ability to surprise, we 
take as our base case scenario an improvement in fx availability that occurs gradually over the 
next 1-3 years as multiple initiatives put in place to boost fx supplies—in exports, services, 
remittances, and FDI—begin to fully kick in.  
 
Foreign exchange availability has become one of the single most pressing challenges faced by many 
private businesses over the past few years.  The challenging fx situation has reflected multiple factors, 
including poor export performance (due to a mix of weak commodity prices and the slow pick-up of 
emerging exports); large imports linked to mega-projects; and political unrest that affected remittances 
and grants in 2016 and 2017. As important, while the managed exchange rate policy of the central bank 
has adjusted the Birr in gradual increments, the magnitudes involved have fallen in short of moving the 
Birr to its market-clearing rate. 
 
Reflecting the above factors, a review of Ethiopia’s fx sources over the past five years shows that 
there has been limited change in total gross inflows. Total gross fx inflows amounted to near $21 
billion last year—but this figure has only grown 44 percent over the past five years while Birr GDP has 
grown over 250 percent. Relative to the size of the economy measured in USD terms, total gross fx 
inflows have fallen from 31 to 25 percent of USD GDP over the past five years. Looking only at current 
account inflows (i.e. recurring items that generate inflows annually as opposed to ‘financing’ items such 
as FDI and borrowing from abroad), one sees that total inflows rose from only from $11.1 to $14.4bn, 
and have again fallen notably relative to the size of the economy—from 23 to 17 percent of USD GDP.

With limited growth on the supply side, the user base of foreign exchange users—mostly importers—
have had to be (de facto) rationed via queues for accessing fx funds at banks.  Imports have averaged 
$15 billion in recent years but this reflects only the addressable (rationed) import demand that is has 
been possible to accommodate given supply constraints. Such import compression—via unsatisfied 
demand at banks—has borne the burden of adjustment, and imports have fallen from 25 to 18 percent 
of GDP in recent years. A sharp import adjustment has thus been taking place in recent years (relative 
to GDP), but his has been driven more by rationing of demand (unmet queues at banks) rather than a 
price-based demand contraction.   
 
The intermediation of foreign exchange funds—from sources to users—has involved five primary 
groups in Ethiopia, and each has had to address excess demand through selective and rationed 
allocations. The five main intermediators—or foreign exchange pools—are the National Bank of 
Ethiopia, the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, the Development Bank of Ethiopia, private banks, and 
(though the amounts are not known) informal currency traders.  Of the $21 billion in fx inflows to the 
country, we estimate about $6-8 billion flows through (i.e. is intermediated by) the National Bank, 
comprising foreign loans, grants, one-off deposits from foreign governments, and (since 2018) 30 
percent of private banks customer fx inflows that are now surrendered to the central bank.  CBE likely 
intermediated amounts of between $5-6bn in recent years per their annual reports, reflecting the fx 
proceeds of its large (private) exporting clients, remittances channelled via its large branch network,

and inflows from its foreign/diaspora clients.  Private banks gather fx from sources that are similar to 
the CBE (exporters, remittances, FDI inflows, foreign/diaspora accounts), and in FY 2017-18 collectively 
intermediated just under $4 billion, by our compilation, with the largest ones (per their annual reports) 
intermediating around $500-600 million per year, the median private bank intermediating around 
$250-$300 mn per year and the smaller ones intermediating amounts of around $100mn a year. Finally, 
a black market also operates in parallel (for which figure are hard to arrive at) whose supply are cash 
notes from abroad plus fx inflows into accounts held abroad while the user base are 
importers/travellers.

Outlook: To Float or not to Float  
 
Looking ahead, when could fx availability start improving? In broad terms, there are two possible 
paths and, as is often the case with major macroeconomic reforms, one may envisage either a ‘big-
bang’ or ‘gradualist’ approach.  
 
If a ‘sudden switch’ or big-bang approach were followed, this would entail a quick and immediate 
exchange rate adjustment to a market-clearing rate followed by a floating mechanism so that it 
remains in line with market conditions. This route of reform makes fx immediately available to all, but 
of course at a higher price. Key questions and concerns with such a reform route are addressed in Text 
Box 9.4 and, in short, we think it could actually be done with little risk and limited adverse impacts, not 
to mention major positive spill-overs (TABLE 9.3). 
   
The alternative to the above approach would involve awaiting current fx-boosting initiatives to 
gradually come on stream and thus removing—in due course—the fx availability problem. This would 
not be an unreasonable approach, but would involve a longer time frame and be dependent on the 
speed and performance of multiple underlying initiatives. Among the many initiatives in this area, the 
most notable prospects for fx improvement over the coming years include: (1) the coming on stream 
of manufactured exports from industrial parks; (2) a jump in electricity exports to neighbouring 
countries; (3) rising services exports as Ethiopian Airlines continues its rapid regional and global 
expansion; (4) rising tourism inflows given multiple initiatives in this area; (5) higher remittance inflows 
in light of recent reforms; (6) prospects for higher official grants following closer re-engagement with 
bilateral and multilateral partners; and (7) rising FDI in line with recent trends, privatization, PPPs, and 
reforms to the ease of doing business.  
 
Given the two alternative paths above, which direction are policymakers likely to take? The selection 
of one approach over the other will reflect policy judgements about the relative risks and rewards. 
Though a bold move involving a ‘sudden switch’ would—in our view—be the preferred option, we think 
it is more realistic to anticipate policymakers pursuing the gradual adjustment scenario—likely to be 
viewed as a safer adjustment route while the alternative may be viewed as carrying higher risks and 
uncertain rewards. Accordingly, it is the gradual adjustment scenario that constitutes our base case 
scenario for 2019 and 2020 and that forms the basis for our macroeconomic projections.

TABLE 9.4: A Floating of the Birr: Might policymakers see this as a viable option in 
2019? 
 
Given far-reaching economic reforms put in place in 2018, it is reasonable to ask if a 
floating of the Birr might be seen as a viable reform option in 2019.  In what follows, we 
address some of the factors that might drive policymakers in this direction, how 
implementation may unfold, and the likely risks and rewards involved. As highlighted 
above, however, we do not yet see this as the base case scenario for the purpose of our 
economic projections. 
 
Motivations: Policymakers' motivation in opting for a floating rate would be to address 
one of the most serious bottlenecks confronting businesses—domestic and foreign 
alike—in the current economic environment. In particular, the reform would aim to 
remove distortions in the current fx system that:  
(1) hold back growth for many manufacturing firms (as they face difficulties in 
securing key imported inputs, operate at low capacity, and are often unable to 
plan long-term); 
(2) deprive many non-priority sectors, including virtually all service providers, from 
getting fx allocations at banks (as their turn in the queue rarely comes up and 
they’re forced to resort to black market suppliers); 
(3) weaken export performance (as many exporters enter the business solely to 
supply parallel import activities, thus distorting export prices and competitive 
conditions for genuine exporters);  
(4) encourage excessive consumption (especially in consumer goods with 
domestic substitutes). 
(5) worsen capital flight and mis-invoicing (as businesses assume shortages will 
persist and use all available opportunities to keep fx earnings out of the 
country)  
Perhaps most importantly, for a country that has set the establishment of an export-
led manufacturing base as a core economic objective, policymakers will be keen to put 
in place a competitive exchange rate that fully promotes the country's industrialization 
aspirations and addresses manufacturers’ key priorities—which would be for quick and 
assured access to fx at a somewhat higher cost rather than a lower price for buying fx 
but one with prolonged and unpredictable waiting times. 
 
Implementation: If enacted, we would expect that any move to a Birr float would (as 
in many other such reforms in other countries) be preceded by and accompanied with 
a comprehensive set of preparations and measures that involve—among other 
things—an adequately stocked reserve pool (to counteract excessive initial swings that 
might be seen in the rate) and coordinated fiscal and monetary policies to ensure that 
inflation is kept under control right after the rate move.

Exchange rate impacts: Contrary to some commonly held views, there need not be a 
major a crash in the exchange rate were a Birr float to be put in place. Some degree of 
depreciation is, of course, to be expected (as the current rate is not market-clearing), 
and the prevailing black-market rate provides an indication of where the new rate 
might settle.  However, under a floating system, there will be forces that work to 
immediately boost fx supply and also just as quickly to restrain fx demand. Among the 
latter, somewhat higher rates will restrain import demand, especially of consumer 
goods and those with domestic substitutes. On the supply side, with a powerful signal 
that the currency issue is being solved once and for all, fx inflows should increase 
sharply following the rate adjustment as black market flows are channelled to official 
channels, particularly cash-based and remittance-related flows. Indeed, as confidence 
in future fx availability is fundamentally changed, and as fx inflows into bank channels 
rise over the near-term, the rate could actually strengthen (appreciate) from its initial 
level, as has been sometimes observed in the black market itself. Some degree of 
central bank intervention (via fx sales to banks or tighter monetary policy) also remains 
an option to moderate any unusual, temporary, or destabilizing movements that might 
arise following a float. Finally, fears of the black-market rate widening yet again from 
the new market-based rate would be unfounded as fx demand is fully met at bank 
counters and (except for a small amount of illicit activities) there would be little 
incentive or benefit from using black markets with very similar rates. 
 
Inflation impacts: A Birr float can be expected to temporarily worsen inflation, but this 
impact should not be exaggerated (imports are roughly 18 percent GDP and probably 
a similar share of the consumer price index while many urban goods already reflect 
black market rates), can be mitigated (by subsidizing certain segments of 
imports/consumers that would be heavily affected), and would in any case be quite 
welcome and desirable for certain product categories (to discourage excessive 
consumption of imported consumer goods).  Various tools at government’s disposal—
such as temporary subsidies or reductions to tariffs and excises—are also available 
should policymakers choose to leave unchanged certain sensitive prices and consumer 
segments. As is the case for many countries under-going such abrupt adjustment, a 
package of strong support from multilateral or bilateral sources (or alternatively early 
execution of plans for privatization or telecom license sales) could in parallel provide 
temporary foreign exchange and budgetary funds to assist with the transition to a new 
fx regime. As the size of current unmet fx demand can be reasonably estimated (based 
on average queuing times and backlog levels seen across all banks), the scale of needed 
funds to temporarily support the float can be approximately identified and sought to 
be met from sources such as privatization proceeds, telecom license sales, external 
support, or other such sources.  
 
Would the risks be worth the rewards? The main risks of a Birr float lie with potentially 
destabilizing movements in inflation and/or the exchange rate, and the attendant 
impacts on real incomes and popular sentiment. But as emphasized above, a mix of 
coordinated policy planning, plus mitigating measures, plus protection to selected 
sensitive areas/consumers can substantially reduce such risks. Such targeted support

is already widely practiced with government policies on certain prices (fuel, electricity, 
import tariffs, telecom prices, excise rates) and certain subsidies (staple foods, housing, 
transport, safety nets, and others). Set against these (manageable) risks are a set of 
potentially profound and transformative benefits, including: elimination of fx queues 
at banks for private firms, government agencies, and consumers; revitalized 
manufacturing activity due to greater access to inputs/raw materials; fx access to long-
deprived sectors (such as services) which were excluded from priority fx allocations 
despite their large GDP/employment/tax contributions; reduced corruption in fx 
allocations; operational predictability for industries to plan long-term based on realistic 
prices; and support for the export sector as firms now focus squarely on genuine export 
operations.  Sharp reductions in many business costs can also be expected, including 
importer margins and bank fx fees, both of which are now highly inflated due simply to 
the current environment of fx constraints. Most importantly, as the true price of 
foreign currency feeds through to the economy, imported items deemed too expensive 
at the new exchange rate would face shrinking demand as they are then—by 
definition—beyond the capacity of the individual consumers/firms/public agencies 
involved. Regarding impacts on the budget, fx reform is probably neutral or positive as 
fx-denominated budgetary inflows (grants and loans are collectively above $4bn 
annually) are higher than public sector debt service dues ($1.5bn last year), so the Birr 
equivalent of the former will exceed the Birr equivalent of the latter. With respect to 
exports, improved Birr returns should boost their performance over time, but even if 
this takes time due to slow supply responses in Ethiopia, the balance of payments can 
still improve quickly and sharply, as excessive imports are compressed within a very 
short period of time. Finally, an open and predictable fx regime removes one major 
disincentive that was important for some foreign investors, and should substantially 
boost new inflows from this sub-group of investors that had been on the side-lines due 
to policies in this area.  All things considered, with adequate preparation, careful 
implementation and due attention to sensitive products/segments that might need 
(temporary) protection, the risks from a Birr float are limited in our view while the 
rewards substantial for day-to-day business operations, for future investment flows, 
and for more durable, long-term economic growth.

10. Where is the Birr heading? 
 
Key points 
 
§ Absent a switch in the FX regime, we expect the central bank to adjust the Birr by taking into 
account inflation trends, movements in the USD, and balance of payments conditions. 
 
§ For 2018-19, we expect inflation to be roughly double that in partner countries, USD rates to 
appreciate slightly vs the Euro (per most market forecasts), and a positive balance of 
payments outturn (we forecast a strong increase in fx reserves this year following last year’s 
modest decline).  
 
§ In light of the above, we expect the central bank to target a depreciation rate that is in line 
with inflation differentials vs trading partners plus USD appreciation vs major currencies—a 
combined sum of around 7 to 8 percent.  We thus forecast a buying rate (at which banks buy 
dollars from customers) of 29.1 Birr/USD at end-June 2019 and 30.1 Birr/USD at end-2019. 
The selling rates (at which importers buy dollars from banks) should be exactly 2 percent 
higher, per the long-standing fixed spread between these two rates.  
 
Movements in the Birr rate are currently set by the National Bank of Ethiopia on a daily basis and 
subsequently communicated to commercial banks each morning for that day’s applicable rate. The 
central bank does not, on its own, have a formal communication system to explicitly relay its rules or 
targets for the exchange rate.  The closest guidance available on exchange rate direction comes 
(occasionally) from annual budget speeches, where in recent years a planned rate of depreciation has 
been announced. For example, in June 2016, the budget speech announced a planned deprecation rate 
of 6 percent for the then upcoming FY 2016-17 fiscal year (the actual outturn was 6.2 percent). In mid-
2017, the President’s annual budget speech indicated that an exchange rate adjustment will ‘be studied 
and implemented’ which, a few weeks later, was followed by a devaluation of 15 percent. 
 
Exchange rate movements in recent years have followed a 5-7 percent annual depreciation rule, 
alongside periodic one-off devaluations.  Since 2010, annual Birr depreciation has averaged between 
5-7 percent per year, except in years which saw one-off devaluations such as in July 2009 (8 percent), 
September 2010 (19 percent) and most recently in October 2017 (15 percent). The years of 
devaluations typically took place in years when inflation was much higher than trading partners, 
resulting in a loss of competitiveness (real appreciation) and thus a need to make a level adjustment in 
the rate.

Following the 15% Birr devaluation in October 2017, the exchange rate was initially kept relatively 
unchanged for the first half of 2018, but has since depreciated at a noticeably faster pace. While the 
initial months following the devaluation suggested a relatively flat exchange rate would remain in place 
(the depreciation averaged only one cent per month from January to June 2018), rate adjustments in 
the Birr have subsequently averaged 13 cents per month since July 2018.  This pace of rate adjustment 
corresponds to an annual depreciation rate of around 6 percent. The faster pace of Birr depreciation 
appears to be in response to still-high inflation, which remained in the low teens in the year following 
the deprecation and thus eroded most of the competitiveness gains from the devaluation. Indeed, with 
the consumer price index up 12 percent between October 2017 and October 2018, the real effective 
exchange rate has almost fully returned to its (elevated) level that prevailed before the devaluation.

Outlook 
 
Assuming the continuation of the ‘gradual crawl’ fx regime, three key variables should figure 
prominently in the central bank’s exchange rate decision-making: (1) Inflation relative to Ethiopia’s 
trading partners; (2) USD movements against other major currencies (as the Birr is fixed relative to the 
USD and it thus appreciates versus other currencies when the USD appreciates vs those currencies); 
and (3) balance of payments conditions. 
 
Considering the range of possible outcomes for the three variables above, we assume the central 
bank’s decision-making process can be summarized by the typology presented in Table 3. In 
particular, if Ethiopia is experiencing low inflation (vs trading partners) and the balance of payment is 
in surplus, the central bank would find no need to move the exchange rate or to engineer a 
depreciation. Conversely, if Ethiopia’s inflation is high (vs partners) and the balance of payments also 
in significant deficit, this merits a depreciation plus an added one-off devaluation—as was the case in 
FY 2017-18. By our judgement, other possible combinations (high inflation with a BOP surplus) would 
merit a gradual depreciation but not call for a one-off devaluation—which is our expectation for this 
year.  In the latter case (high inflation with a BOP surplus), the size of the gradual depreciation would 
be guided by inflation differentials (vs trading partners), but also be adjusted for movements in the USD 
vs other major currencies (i.e., if the USD appreciates vs other major currencies, the magnitude of Birr 
depreciation needed to maintain competitiveness would seek to cover the inflation differential vs 
trading partners plus an extra amount for offsetting the USD appreciation).

For FY 2018-19, we expect Ethiopia’s inflation to be above trading partners, some degree of USD 
appreciation vs other currencies, and a surplus on the balance of payments. More specifically:  
 
• Inflation vs trading partners: Our projection for FY 2018-19 year-average inflation is around 9 
to 10 percent, while inflation in Ethiopia’s export markets (taking the IMF’s projected inflation 
for the top 20 destinations) is projected to be around 4.5 percent.  Accordingly, a depreciation 
similar to these inflation differences would be required—all else equal—to keep the real 
effective exchange rate broadly unchanged.  
 
• USD dollar: With respect to the USD, to which the Birr is linked, an appreciation of USD to other 
currencies is expected by most market analysts. Taking an average of market forecasts, we work 
with a 3 percent USD appreciation vs major currencies as the base case projection for 2019.   
 
• Balance of payments: With respect to the balance of payments, we expect reserves to rise in FY 
2018-19 following the reserve decline (from $3,197mn to $2,996mn) seen in FY 2017-18.  
Growth in goods exports will remain weak this year, given observed first quarter export outturns 
(7 percent year-on-year decline), the still early stages of industrial park exports (textiles, leather, 
shoes) and what is likely to be a slow-growth year for both coffee and oilseeds (both were down 
versus year ago levels for the July-September 2018 quarter). Services exports will likely rise by 
near 10 percent, given the strength of Ethiopian Airlines and its on-going passenger and cargo

volume expansions this year. A big improvement is forecast for remittances (expected to reach 
$5.6bn), given diaspora responses to recent reforms and the re-launching of worker placement 
programs to the Middle East, while grants should begin to improve sharply over last year’s levels 
with rising external bilateral support for the new administration. Within the capital account, we 
project FDI will reach $4bn for the year (not yet assuming any privatization inflows for FY 2018-
19), while public sector borrowing should be in the neighbourhood of $2.3 billion in concessional 
loans. The net impact of the above developments will be a balance of payments surplus of 
around $900 million, and a corresponding rise in reserves from $3.0bn in June 2018 to just under 
$4.0bn by June 2019.

Based on the above forecasts, and given our assumption of the NBE’s approach to exchange rate 
determination, we expect the central bank to implement a depreciation in FY 2018-19 that is in line 
with combined sum of Ethiopia’s inflation differentials (vs trading partners) and the projected USD 
appreciation (vs major currencies). We thus expect to see the central bank engineering a depreciation 
equal to the around 7.5 percent for this year.  On this basis, we project the exchange rate will reach Birr 
29.1 per USD by June 2019 and Birr 30.1 per USD by December 2019. With a slightly lower inflation 
differential next year, and a second projected year of rising reserves, we project a 5 percent annual 
depreciation FY 2019-20, and thus forecast a rate 30.9 Birr/USD by June 2020, and 31.8 Birr/USD by 
December 2020. The above apply to buying rates (at which exporters sell dollars to banks), and the 
corresponding selling rates (at which importers buy dollars from banks) should be exactly 2 percent 
higher, per the long-standing fixed spread between these two rates. As underlined in Chapter 9, all of 
the above forecasts assume it is the gradual fx adjustment scenario—rather than a switch to a free float 
of the Birr—that drives central bank policy efforts to improve foreign exchange conditions over the 
coming years.
