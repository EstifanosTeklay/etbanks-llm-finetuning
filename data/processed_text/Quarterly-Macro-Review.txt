Quarterly Macroeconomic Review: January—March 2019 
 
We expect GDP growth this year to be slightly lower, and inflation slightly higher, than 
we had previously projected but keep our forecasts for exchange rates, fx reserves, and 
public debt largely unchanged from those in our 2019 Macroeconomic Handbook. The 
economy’s momentum and outlook still remains positive—in our view—thanks to 
improvements in several external inflows (remittances, grants, concessional loans), 
continued foreign investment interest and activity, as well as encouraging prospects 
for reforms in the SOE sector and in the ease of doing business.   
 
§ GDP growth: We revise slightly—from 9 percent to 8 percent—our GDP growth 
projection for this fiscal year as early estimates of the late 2018 meher crop 
outturn suggest somewhat lower volumes than we had anticipated (31.5mn tons 
vs an expected 32.6mn tons). The growth revision reflects mainly the lower 
estimate for agriculture (which makes up 35 percent of GDP), and we keep largely 
unchanged growth projections for the other sub-sectors, including services and 
industry.  Although there is—in some quarters—a view of broad weakening in 
economic activity (attributed to unrest in parts of the country, public sector 
cutbacks, and negative export performance), we think such assessments are 
overstated as the unrest has (so far) been limited in its economic scope and since 
exports are not a material share of economic activity (only 3.4% of GDP).  More 
important drivers of growth in Ethiopia remain the change in agricultural output 
(modest but still positive this year due to the good rains of 2018), trends in 
services (which we think is growing strongly especially in tourism, hotels, 
banking), and construction activity (the second largest sub-sector after crops and 
one that is benefiting from still-strong private activity in this area).   
 
§ Investment: Data on investment registrations compiled by EIC show the entry of 
157 new foreign investors (roughly one each week day) during the first six 
months of the fiscal year. At the same time, data on actual FDI inflows as 
estimated by NBE point to $1.8bn in FDI inflows during July-December 2018. 
Though this is down about 19 percent from the same-period last year, FDI still 
seems on track to reach $4bn—or just slightly lower—for the full year.  
 
§ Inflation: Contrary to our expectations, inflation has still not yet fallen to single-
digit levels and instead showed a 11.1 percent year-on-year reading for end-
March 2019 (vs our 9.4 percent projection). There was a surprisingly high 2.2 
percent month-on-month inflation in March 2019 (implying an annualized rate 
of more than 24 percent), which was due to double-digit inflation in items such 
as bread, cereal crops, vegetables, clothing, and household furnishings (items 
with the highest weights in the CPI index). As before, we expect inflation to

remain close to 10 percent for the remainder of 2019, though just above that 
threshold per our revised projections.   
 
§ Monetary policy:  Monetary data for the first half of the fiscal year reveal 22 
percent growth in overall money supply and 13 percent growth in central bank 
base money—both below growth rates seen at the end of the last fiscal year (29 
and 19 percent respectively) and thus suggestive of a more restrained stance for 
monetary policy.  An increase in domestic credit supply, up 21 percent from year-
ago levels, was the main driver of money supply growth. Growth in net 
government borrowing from the central bank was limited to just 8 percent (year-
on-year) as of December 2018, a decline from 18.1 percent growth seen in June 
2018 and 32.7 percent growth seen a year ago—suggestive again of a less 
expansionary orientation on the part of the government and central bank.  
 
§ Banking developments: Bank deposits and loans continued to show strong year-
on-year growth, of 22 and 28 percent respectively, reinforcing our views of still 
healthy activity levels in the broader economy. Total deposits rose from Birr 
729bn to Birr 837bn in the first nine months of the fiscal year (equivalent to 32 
percent of this year’s estimated GDP), and are comprised of Birr 504bn in CBE 
deposits and Birr 333bn in private bank deposits. Loan levels at private banks 
grew especially strongly, up 37 percent from year-ago levels, and it appears that 
the weak credit demand observed in the early part of the fiscal year is no longer 
of concern. The nation-wide bank branch count of commercial banks reached 
5,104 as of December 2018 (1,458 at CBE and 3,646 at private banks), while paid-
up capital levels have reached Birr 72bn (7 percent of assets). Nine-month 
provisional profit levels are reported at around Birr 25bn, up well over 50 percent 
from year-ago levels, indicating that bank profits for the full year should 
comfortably exceed Birr 30bn—which is set to be a historical record. 
 
§ Fiscal policy: Government revenue for the first nine months reached Birr 146bn, 
or a 9 percent increase from the same period of the previous year; revenue 
growth was a more robust 15 percent if looking just at taxes derived from 
domestic economic activity (as fx constraints are holding back import-related 
taxes).   More complete six-month fiscal data from the NBE (June to December) 
show revenue of Birr 110 bn, expenditure of Birr 150bn, and a half-year deficit of 
Birr 40 bn.  Given the budget’s planned deficit of Birr 92bn for the full year (on a 
financing basis), the first six month outturn seems well within the budgeted 
deficit. A Supplementary Budget was passed in March 2019, amounting to Birr 
33bn, but available information suggests this is to be financed mainly by recently 
received (concessional) external financing and should thus not create extra 
government borrowing from NBE or from commercial banks.   
 
§ Debt: Public debt has reached $51.6bn as of December 2018 from $49.5bn at 
June 2018, per the latest data from MOFEC’s quarterly debt bulletin. Relative to 
this year’s estimated GDP, public debt has fallen to 55 percent, thanks to the 
rising denominator. Of the $2.1bn public debt increase during the six months to 
December 2018, about $1bn was new external debt (contracted mainly from the 
World Bank and airplane financiers) while the remaining $1bn (Birr 28bn) was

domestic debt contracted mainly by the Government. Private sector debt has 
risen from Birr 385bn as of June 2018 to an estimated Birr 444 bn as of December 
2018 (up 15% over the six months), based on our summation of private sector 
borrowing from banks, from MFIs, and from foreign lenders.  
 
§ Balance of payments (BOP): BOP data for the first half of the fiscal year show 
exports down by 10 percent and imports up by one percent (more recent trade 
data covering the nine months to March 2019 show roughly similar growth rates). 
Fx inflows from services were $2.6bn (up 35 percent year-on-year) while 
remittances were just under $3.0 bn for the first six months (up 12 percent year-
on-year) and are likely to reach $6bn for the year. In other areas, the six-month 
fx inflow figures were $766mn for grants, $801mn for loans, and $1.8bn for FDI.  
With respect to fx reserves, NBE data for end-December 2018 show a level of 
$3,958mn (see Quarterly Bulletin Appendix Table 1a), the highest level in over a 
decade, though this was due to financial transactions by the NBE (including 
deposit placements by foreign creditors) rather than an improvement in the 
current account or private capital account. Indeed, per NBE data, the reserves 
increase coincided with newly incurred liabilities, so the net foreign asset 
position of the central bank has failed to rise in line with the increase in gross 
reserves. Reserves at commercial banks (which are altogether separate from the 
NBE’s official reserves stock) were $1,011 mn at end-December 2018, somewhat 
above their average levels over the past few years. Still, given a large demand 
back log, securing needed supplies of foreign exchange remains challenging for 
businesses, reflecting policy preferences for a gradual adjustment in the 
exchange rate.   
 
§ Exchange rate: The central bank continued to move the Birr rate by around 14 to 
16 cents per month, equivalent to a 6 percent depreciation rate on an annualized 
basis. The end-March 2019 exchange rate outturn of 28.49 Birr/USD was slightly 
less depreciated than our forecast (28.57 Birr/USD), but we retain our original 
projections for the remainder of the year as we expect a slightly faster pace of 
adjustment from here on (inflation remains above expectations and the USD has 
appreciated modestly vs other currencies, so pressures will remain to correct for 
this loss of competitiveness). We see the rate at 28.95 Birr/USD at end-June 2019 
and 30.00 Birr/USD at end-Dec 2019.    
 
§ Sovereign bond: Yields are down sharply for Ethiopia’s sovereign bond, from 7.56 
percent at end-December 2018 to 6.28 percent at end-March 2019, suggesting a 
more positive assessment of creditworthiness by foreign investors. Spreads 
relative to US Treasuries also moved downwards, from 500 to 403 basis points 
over the same period.  Moving in opposite direction, the bond’s price (for a 100 
par value) rose from 95.6 to 101.6, providing a 6 percent gain over the past 
quarter for holders for Ethiopia’s sovereign bond. The yield decline seen in 
Ethiopia’s sovereign bond reflects global factors, i.e., the positive sentiment 
towards all emerging markets led to a decline in EMBI yields—a weighted 
average for this category of countries—by a broadly similar amount in Q1 2019.

§ Changes to Cephues Capital’s economic outlook and projections: We retain 
most of our forecasts from the 2019 Macroeconomic Handbook and thus keep 
largely unchanged our end-June 2019 projections for the exchange rate (now 
28.95 Birr/USD), fx reserves ($3.982bn), and public debt (57% of GDP). Our 
limited revisions, as signaled above, are in the following areas: 
 
o GDP Growth:  This is revised downward as it will be difficult to achieve 9 
percent overall growth if agricultural output—per meher crop estimates—
grew by only around 2.8 percent this year. We follow the IMF in making 
this downward revision (they cut their growth forecast for Ethiopia from 
8.5 to 7.7 percent in the April 2019 Africa Regional Economic Outlook), 
though we still retain a slightly higher projection (8 percent vs 7.7 percent). 
 
o Inflation: With price levels already up 7 percent in the first nine months of 
the fiscal year, single-digit inflation is no longer in prospect for June 2019 
(month-on-month inflation rates typically average 1 percent for the last 
three months of the fiscal year, judging by past norms). Though the stance 
of monetary policy does not appear to be contributing to inflationary 
pressures, the recent loosening of some administratively set prices—
particularly for bread, electricity, and fuel—appears to be doing the 
opposite in the near-term. We thus see year-on-year inflation reaching 
10.7 percent at end-June 2019 and remaining mostly within the 10-12 
percent range for the rest of 2019.  
 
o Banking activity: Deposit, loan, and profit levels as of end-March 2019 
turned out somewhat stronger than we expected, so we revisit our 
projections in all three areas for the end-fiscal year’s banking and financial 
projections.

ECONOMIC ACTIVITY: Recent Developments and Outlook
Crop output expected to increase this year but by less than anticipated: 
 
§ 
CSA crop estimates now 
point to a modest 2.8 
percent increase this FY, 
vs the 6.5 percent we 
had anticipated 
 
§ 
Output grew strongly for 
most cereal crops, but 
was dragged down by 
declines in oilseeds and 
pulses 
 
§ 
With output up 2.8% and 
harvested area up only 
0.7%, this implies yields 
are up by about 2.1 
percent (to 2.46 
tons/hectare). 
 
 
 
 
 
Growth projections:  
§ 
Lower growth for 
agriculture (which makes 
up 35% of GDP) has 
reduced overall growth 
by 1 percentage point 
 
§ 
We keep unchanged 
expected growth in 
industry, currently 
dominated by 
construction sector 
activity 
 
§ 
Somewhat better-than- 
expected growth is seen 
in services, given trends 
in remittances and 
banking

BANKING: Recent developments and outlook 
 
Deposit and lending trends: 
§ 
Deposits are up by a 
strong 22 percent, year-
on-year, and grew much 
faster at private banks 
(up 34%) than at CBE (up 
15%) 
 
§ 
Loan growth at private 
banks has been 
especially strong at 37% 
year-on-year, double the 
growth seen at CBE 
 
 
FISCAL POLICY: Recent developments and outlook 
 
Nine month revenue performance: 
§ 
Revenue growth is a 
strong 15 percent, year-
on-year, looking just at 
taxes linked to domestic 
economic activity 
 
§ 
As fx constraints are 
holding back import 
growth, taxes linked to 
imported goods showed 
near zero growth 
 
 
 
 
Six month budget performance:  
§ 
The six month deficit 
figure of near Birr 40bn 
seems well within the 
budgeted deficit for the 
year

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS (BOP): Recent developments and outlook 
 
Balance of payments: 
§ 
Exports continue to 
perform poorly (down 
10%) but the trade 
deficit has not worsened 
much given near-zero 
import growth 
 
§ 
With imports relatively 
flat in USD terms, the 
ratio of imports to GDP 
is set to fall further this 
year. 
 
§ 
Services exports, 
remittances, grants, FDI, 
and (concessional) loans 
continue to provide 
large fx inflows

Exchange rate projection:  
§ 
We expect a slightly 
faster pace of exchange 
rate adjustment for the 
rest of 2019 
 
§ 
A 7 percent annualized 
depreciation rate, which 
we forecast for this year, 
will imply a rate of 30 
Birr/USD by end-2019 
 
§ 
We expect USD selling 
rates to remain exactly 2 
percent higher than the 
buying rate, per recent 
norms.
