MESSAGE FROM

THE PRESIDENT

We at the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia are very happy to see that the stakeholders of the Bank are
pleased with the consistent growth registered over the past consecutive years. In 2014/15, CBE
earned 22.8 billion Birr total revenue and 12.7 billion Birr profit before tax. The profit has shown 31

percent increment from the past year.

The expansion of the country’s GDP by 10.4 percent in the year, the conducive investment atmosphere

and government policies have played parts for the success. However, price volatility of primary

products in the international market challenged the Bank's foreign currency earning potential to

some extent.

The year 2014/15 was the closing year of CBE’s first five-year strategic plan and the beginning of its
second (2015/16-2019/20] strategic plan. The Bank's financial position has shown a marked transfor-

mation during the first five years of the strategic plan. Total deposit increased by fourfold, reaching

242.5 billion Birr as compared to the level in 2010. This showed an annual average growth of 34
percent over the five successive years. Moreover, with an average annual growth rate of 25 percent,
CBE’s total asset stood at 305.1 billion Birr. It was also possible to inject close to 322 billion Birr to

the economy in fresh loan and bond disbursement during the just concluded strategic period.

Besides, though the Bank envisioned opening 100 branches per annum, it was able to open 133
branches in 2014/15 alone. The well-articulated resource mobilization strategy has helped CBE to
dramatically increase its customer base; and as a result, the customer base which was 2.2 million

during the base year of 2010 reached 10.5 million at the end of 2014/15.

As in the previous years, CBE has continued to lead the banking industry in introducing new products

and availing technology-based banking services. The deployment of ATMs, POS terminals, Internet

and Mobile Banking services has intensified the Bank's endeavor to achieve service excellence. This

has required the Bank a lot in terms of finance and skilled manpower.

10 Commercial Bank of Ethiopia

“ Most importantly, the trust and loyalty we
enjoyed from our beloved customers have

been the major drivers behind our success.”

In a bid to further build its capacity, the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia inaugurated in 2014/15 a
|2-story monumental building that serves as a Center of Excellence where robust human resource
could be developed. The center will have huge contributions towards building leadership capability

and operational skills of its employees.

To accommodate its rapid internal growth and address the subsequent office space challenge it has

been facing, the Bank also laid down a cornerstone for a 53-story Headquarters in 2014/15. This
edifice, together with the other medium size buildings CBE is constructing, will contribute toward

boosting the image of the capital city as well.

Well aware of its nationwide socio-economic responsibilities, the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia has
also been supporting the development priorities of the country by financing projects thought to bring
about breakthrough in the economy. In addition, it supported organizations in areas of health,
education, sports, arts and culture. As a result of these and other planned activities of the Bank, a
subsequent reputation survey showed that CBE had good reputation in 2014/15, suggesting the high

level of public confidence the Bank enjoys.

The accomplishments registered in the period under review would not have been possible without the

unreserved leadership and guidance of the Board of Directors and the commitment of its employees.
Most importantly, the trust and loyalty we enjoyed from our beloved customers have been the major
drivers behind our success. | would like, therefore, to take this opportunity to thank all stakeholders

or their strong commitment and trust in the Bank.

Finally, | have no doubt that CBE will preserve its dynamism and innovativeness with a view to

attaining further heights and exceeding the expectations of its stakeholders.

In 2014/15, total income of the Bank stood at Birr 23.2 billion, registering a growth of 30.4%

2.2.2 Outstanding Loans by Sector

The total outstanding loans of the Bank for 2014/15 stood at Birr 266.2 billion, depicting an
increase of 32.4% from the previous year. A large portion of the loans went to the manufac-
turing sector, which took around 21.6% of the total outstanding loan. Loans to the manufac-
turing sector grew by around 30% during the year.

The second largest portion of the loan was given to foreign trade, which had nearly 8% share
of the total loans, and grew by around 25% during the year. Domestic trade and services
had around 2% share of the total outstanding loans, and it grew by around 41%. This shows
that the Bank has been striving to boost the contribution of the manufacturing sector of the
economy.

2.2.3 Liabilities

In 2014/15, the total liabilities of the Bank reached Birr 291.8 billion, which shows an annual
growth of 25.2% from the past fiscal year. Growth in customers’ deposit was the major
contributor to the growth of the overall liabilities of the Bank. Mobilized deposits remained
the major source of funding. Aggressive expansion in branch network, large public
confidence and favorable business environment helped the Bank to command a large
deposit base. During the year, the Bank's total deposit reached Birr 242.5 billion, indicating
a growth of 25% when compared with that of 2013/14. This was mainly due to the growth of
saving deposits by about 34%. Demand deposits increased as well by 17% when compared
with the past fiscal year. This shows that the Bank has been expanding in all types of
deposits.

above the minimum requirements of 8%. Growth in capital and reserve position further
reflects the Bank’s continued financial strength.

significant amount of revenue. The Bank maintains healthy business relationships with many
prominent banks around the world. The overall income earned from foreign banking
operations stood at Birr 5.5 billion, which suggests an increase by 3.5% from the last fisca

year under review reached USD 5.8 billion, up by 4.12% from 2013/14. All the FCY earning
categories recorded a favorable achievernent when compared with the preceding year.

With large concentration of Ethiopian Diaspora communities in North America, Europe,

3. Other Developments

3.1 Human Resources

Strengthening the human resources development effort is key to organizational success. In
this regard, CBE has continued to exert unreserved efforts towards capacitating its human
capital through providing various on-the-job training for both existing and new staff. It has
also been striving on recruiting additional new employees and retaining trained and well-

qualified staff through various incentives and benefit packages. In 2014/15, the Bank
recruited 4,976 permanent employees, and the total number of staff was raised to 22,908
from 18,524 in the past fiscal year.

With the objective of enhancing the expertise and professionalism of its ernployees to the
required level, a total of 33,769 employees participated in different leadership and technical

capacity enhancement training programs during the year. In addition to in-house skill
upgrading training programs, the Bank sponsored several employees to attend
post-graduate studies.

Annual Report 2014/15 19

As the success of the Bank highly depends on the quality of its human resources, CBE will
continue to give emphasis on recruiting qualified professionals and training its staff. By doing
so, the Bank would ensure that its workforce is equipped with the appropriate managerial
and technical knowledge in the competitive and dynamic business environment. The
inauguration of CBE’s Center of Excellence, which is a 12 story building well equipped with
high quality training facilities during the fiscal year is a big step in this direction. The Center
is expected to enhance leadership capabilities and professionalism of employees.

Recent advancement in information technologies towards service industry has brought about
vast opportunities. The effort of CBE to tap these opportunities has been encouraging and
crucial to transform the Bank. The recent performance of CBE shows that the total cost of
investment on IT hardware and software reached around Birr 754 million in June 2015. This
balance was around Birr 573 million in 2013/14. As a result of this investment, the number of
ATMs and POSs deployed in different parts of the country has consistently increased. Most of
the Bank branches and other units were also connected to the core banking, which went live
in 2012 and helped to improve service delivery. Mobile and Internet Banking Services had
also expanded. These efforts will continue in the years to come to make the Bank more

competitive.

CBE opened 133 new branches in 2014/15, which increased its total branch network to 965.
Many of its branches also expanded their services by opening additional windows.
Consequently, the customer base grew significantly, reaching 10.6 million account holders
and an increment of about 2.4 million account holders during the fiscal year under review. In
the same year, the number of ATMs reached 644, about 1,886 Point of Sale [POS] terminals
were also deployed across major cities and business locations. Moreover, additional 630,601
visa cards were issued during the fiscal year and the number of visa card holders reached

1,604,363.

Apart from enhancing accessibility, impressive progress was also registered in the fiscal year
with respect to the recently introduced new products such as Education Savings, Interest
Free Banking, Youth, and Women Savings Schemes. These products have been progressing
well and contributed to the overall deposit mobilization efforts of the Bank.

In the years to come, CBE will continue to expand its branch network, to deploy more ATMs
and POS terminals so that it could enhance convenience and further improve service delivery.
By boosting service delivery and expanding its outreach, the Bank is committed to
maintaining its market share and adding values to its customers.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE
SUPERVISING AUTHORITY OF
COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Commercial Bank of
Ethiopia and its consolidated subsidiaries, which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 30
June 2015, and the consolidated profit and loss account and statement of comprehensive income,
statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary

of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

Responsibility for the Financial Statements

The President of the Bank is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these
consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and
in the manner required by the Commercial Code of Ethiopia of 1960, and for such internal control as
management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free

from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditors' Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those
standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material

misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures
in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers
internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the

consolidated financial statements.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE
SUPERVISING AUTHORITY OF
COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA (continued)

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis

for our audit opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Commercial Bank of Ethiopia and its subsidiaries as at 30 June
2015 and their consolidated financial performance and consolidated cash flows for the year then

ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the

Commercial Code of Ethiopia of 1960.

the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits
from its activities.

3: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

a] Statement of compliance

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and in the
manner required by the Commercial Code of Ethiopia of 1960.

b) Basis of preparation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis,
except for the measurement of impaired assets at their fair values. Historical cost is
generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets.

The principal accounting policies are set out below.

c) Income

Income is recognized in the period in which it is earned. When a lending account becomes
non-performing, interest is suspended and excluded from income until it is received, However,
itis computed and shown ina memorandum account. Expense is recognized in the period in
which it is incurred.

holder is established.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
e) Treasury bills and government securities

Treasury bills and government securities bearing interest are stated at cost plus accrued
interest. Non-interest bearing securities are discounted using the effective interest rate

f) Coupon and corporate bonds
Coupon and corporate bonds are stated at cost.
g) Financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Bank becomes a party to
the contractual provisions of the instrument. They are initially measured at fair value.

Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting

period. Financial assets are considered to be impaired when there is objective evidence that,
as aresult of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial
asset, the estimated future cash flows of the asset have been affected.

h) Other investments

Other investments are stated at cost. Income is recognized only to the extent that distributions
are received from net profits that have arisen subsequent to the date of acquisition.

i) Tangible assets
(i] Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged on the straight-line basis at the following rates per annum.

Z T%
Buildings i 5
Computers and software _ 25
Fixtures, fittings and equipment | 20
Motor vehicles 20

ii) Capital work in progress

j) Advance payment for asset planned to be sold
This payment is an advance for a warehouse. The warehouse was acquired to be sold.

k) Goodwill
Goodwill is in respect to a printing business which is a cash-generating unit. The unit is
tested for impairment at each year end.

) Leases
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards incidental
to ownership of the leased item, are capitalized at the inception of the lease at the fair value
of the property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease
payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so
as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance
charges are reflected in profit or loss.

Leasehold land is presented separately on the face of the balance sheet and is stated at cost
ess accumulated amortization. The costs are amortized over the period of the leases.

m) Taxation

ncome tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

i} Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from
profit reported in the profit and loss account because of items of income or expense that are
axable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The
Bank's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

ii) Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used inthe
computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable
emporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible
emporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available
against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewe at the end of each reporting
period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable
profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in

the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realized, based on tax rates and tax
legislation that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period.
The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities reflects the tax consequences

that would follow from the manner in which the Enterprise, as at the end of the reporting

period, expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of these assets and liabilities,

n) Distribution of profits

The net profit of the Bank is distributed in accordance with Distribution of Profits of Public
Enterprises Council of Ministers Regulation No. 107/2004.

o) Leave accrual

Employees’ entitlements to annual leave are recognized when they accrue to employees. A
provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave at the reporting date.

p) Cash and cash equivalents

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on
hand and in banks and short term, highly liquid investments with maturity periods of three
months or less.

q) Translation of foreign currencies

Transactions in foreign currencies during the year are translated into Ethiopian Birr at the
exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency monetary assets and
liabilities are translated at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Resultant
exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss for the year. Non-monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currency are recorded at the exchange rate ruling at
the date of the transaction.

r) Trust funds

Nature of contingent liabilities

Letters of credit commit the Bank to make payment to third parties, on production of
documents, which are subsequently reimbursed by the customers.

An acceptance is an undertaking by a bank to pay a bill of exchange drawn on acustomer. The
Bank expects most acceptances to be presented and reimbursement by the customer is
almost immediate.

Guarantees are generally written by a bank to support the performance by a customer to third
parties. The Bank _will_only be required-to_meet-these obligations in the event of the
customers default.

TRUST FUNDS

used by management to control risk. The most important types of financial risks to which iii) Market risk

ii) Liquidity risk non-trading positions.

Liquidity risk arises in the general funding of the Group's activities and in the
management of positions. It includes both the risk of being unable to fund assets at
appropriate maturities and rates and the risk of being unable to liquidate an asset at
a reasonable price and in an appropriate time frame. :

The Group has access to a diverse funding base. Funds are raised mainly from
deposits and capital. This enhances funding flexibility, limits dependence on any one
source of funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. The Group strives to maintain
a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of liabilities
with a range of maturities. The Group continually assesses liquidity risk by identifying
and monitoring changes in funding required to meet business goals and targets set
in terms of the overall Bank strategy.

In addition the Group holds a portfolio of liquid assets as part of its liquidity risk
management strategy.
