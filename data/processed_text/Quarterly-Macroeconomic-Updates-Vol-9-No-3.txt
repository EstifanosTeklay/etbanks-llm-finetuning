Introduction 
This quarterly macroeconomic report provides an update on the macroeconomic situation in 
Ethiopia, focusing on two key macroeconomic developments with significant implications for the 
Ethiopian economy. The exchange rate developments in the post-reform period cover July to mid-
September 2024 while the international trade update delves into developments during the third 
quarter of the 2023/2024 Ethiopian fiscal year (January to March 2024). Some key 
macroeconomic issues affecting the country's economic stability are the accelerated depreciation 
of the ETB particularly after the exchange rate reform, the shortage of foreign exchange, and the 
widening spread of buying-selling rates.  
Ethiopia’s heavy reliance on primary exports tends to expose the country to the volatility of 
recurrent prices and foreign exchange earnings and the small size of exports contributes to the 
ongoing and widening trade deficit. Such persistent deficits and the associated financing 
requirements have forced the country to depend heavily on external debt, increasing its debt 
vulnerability and susceptibility to external shocks, ultimately forcing the country to resort to an 
IMF-backed macroeconomic reform program. 
This report aims to provide policymakers, investors, and researchers with valuable insights into 
Ethiopia's latest macroeconomic landscape, focusing on the foreign exchange market and 
international trade developments. It aims to facilitate informed decision-making and effective 
policy interventions. 
The following two sections of the updates discuss the key developments in the selected indicators.

Exchange Rate Dynamics in a Post-Reform Landscape  
This section examines exchange rate dynamics in the post-reform period, spanning from July to 
mid-September 2024. It delves into the rapid depreciation of the currency (ETB) against the US 
Dollar, a key trend observed during this period. Additionally, the analysis explores the widening 
gap between buying and selling rates and the intensified competition among banks offering the 
most favorable exchange rates. Finally, the section investigates the response of the parallel market 
to the exchange rate reform, highlighting its short-term implications for the new macroeconomic 
policy environment.  
 
 
 
 
 
Key facts and figures 
• The Ethiopian Birr (ETB) has rapidly depreciated against the USD in the post-reform 
period.  
• Between July 30, 2024, and September 15, 2024, the exchange rate surged from ETB 
57.8 to 117.3 per USD. This represents a nearly 103% depreciation, with a daily 
average of about 2.3%. 
• As of September 16, 2024, the Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE), Bunna 
International Bank, and Addis International Bank led the ranking with the highest 
buying rates, offering ETB 116.01, 115, and 112.44 per USD, respectively. 
• As of September 16, 2024, Bunna International Bank topped the list with the highest 
selling rate at 124.91 ETB/USD. Close behind were Zamzam Bank and Tsedey Bank, 
offering rates of 124.44 ETB/USD and 123.15 ETB/USD, respectively. 
• Since the reform period, the spread between buying and selling rates for USD has 
widened. 
• The initial buying-selling exchange rate spread for USD was approximately ETB 1.63 
in early August 2024. The spread surged to ETB 5.75(6%) by the first week's end and 
further climbed to a peak of ETB 10.4 (10%) by mid-August. While the spread increased 
slightly between mid-August and mid-September, it stabilized around ETB 11.6 (about 
11%). 
• Post-reform, the official-parallel exchange rate gap narrowed dramatically, falling 
from over ETB 65 (112.5%) per US dollar on July 29, 2024, on average, to around ETB 
10 (10%) for most of the subsequent period up to Sep 16, 2024.

2.1. 
Context of the Exchange Rate Reform 
After decades of rapid growth and improvement of living standards, a series of shocks, including 
domestic conflict, the COVID-19 pandemic, droughts, and spillovers from the Russia-Ukraine 
war, coupled with macroeconomic policy shortcomings have pushed the country to a critical 
juncture. The public investment-led growth model has reached its limits, exacerbated by exchange 
rate overvaluation, insufficient policy adjustments, and imprudent economic management. These 
challenges have culminated in high inflation, falling exports, foreign exchange shortages, 
dwindling international reserves, and unsustainable external debt (International Monetary Fund 
(IMF), 2024). As of May 2024, Ethiopia's foreign exchange reserves were barely sufficient for 
one month of imports, and pressures on the fiscal and current account balances were mounting 
(UNDP, 2024). Additionally, the country's external debt has experienced a 1.9% year-over-year 
growth, reaching a staggering $28.8 billion by June 30, 2024. This rapid increase exacerbates the 
nation's debt problem (Ministry of Finance (MoF), 2024). The country faces significant debt 
servicing costs. According to MoF (2024), the cost of servicing external public sector debt 
exceeded $1.265 billion between July 2023 and June 2024, covering both principal and interest 
payments, as well as fees. 
Ethiopia's overdependence on primary commodity exports, such as coffee and other agricultural 
products, has significant implications for its macroeconomic stability. This reliance exposes the 
country to fluctuations in global commodity prices, leading to volatile foreign exchange earnings 
and a persistent trade deficit. The small size of Ethiopia's export base exacerbates these challenges, 
contributing to the ongoing trade imbalance. To finance these deficits, the country has increasingly 
turned to external debt, raising concerns about debt sustainability and vulnerability to external 
shocks. The persistent trade deficits and growing debt burden have ultimately forced Ethiopia to 
seek support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) through a macroeconomic reform 
program. This program aims to address the country's underlying economic challenges, including 
improving trade competitiveness, diversifying exports, and enhancing fiscal and monetary 
management. 
Reflecting their ambition to transform the economic model towards private sector-led 
development, and recognizing the urgent need for reform, the Ethiopian government authorities 
developed the Home-Grown Economic Reform Agenda (HERA II). This ambitious plan aims to 
tackle the drivers of economic imbalances including moving to a market-determined exchange 
rate, modernizing the monetary policy framework, tackling challenges of fiscal revenues, and 
reforming state-owned enterprises (IMF, 2024). Ethiopia’s foreign exchange reform is just one 
part of a wider package of macroeconomic reforms to be implemented and accelerated over the 
coming months (NBE, 2024). On July 29, 2024, the government announced the introduction of a 
competitive, market-based exchange rate system, departing from the ‘managed floating’ exchange 
rate system, anticipating that this policy shift would yield substantial economic benefits for the 
nation. 
The government highlights that the reform is domestically driven and not an IMF-induced 
program. However, critics argue that the country's severe macroeconomic challenges, which

Volume 9 Number 03 
 
October 2024 
 
    4 
necessitate substantial foreign financing, have left the government with little alternative but to 
adopt the IMF's proposed exchange rate and broader macroeconomic reforms (ECOEMERGING1, 
2024). Accordingly, the Ethiopian authorities have requested a four-year arrangement under the 
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) for Special Drawing Right (SDR) 2,555.95 million (850 percent 
of the quota or about US$3.4 billion) to help address the protracted balance of payments needs 
related to structural external imbalances (IMF, 2024). Only $1 billion of the total $3.4 billion IMF 
disbursement will be provided to Ethiopia immediately, with the remaining $2.4 billion phased 
out over the next four years.  
2.2. 
Pillars of Exchange Rate Reform 
Since 1992, Ethiopia has adopted a 'managed floating' exchange rate system, characterized by 
occasional government interventions in the foreign exchange market to buy or sell currencies (UN, 
2020). However, the IMF categorizes the previous exchange rate regime as a crawling-peg 
arrangement (IMF, 2024), i.e. not ‘managed float’. This shift from a ‘managed floating’ exchange 
rate system had profound economic implications, as evidenced by the immediate 30% depreciation 
of the Ethiopian Birr (ETB) against the US dollar. Over the subsequent days, the ETB continued 
its downward trajectory, culminating in a 75% depreciation. For instance, by August 5, 2024, the 
currency had lost three-quarters of its value against the USD. 
The newly implemented market-based exchange rate regime represented a substantial departure 
from the prior managed floating system, incorporating several key changes. The key changes 
include 
• Market-determined exchange rate: Ethiopia has shifted from a managed floating exchange 
rate regime to a fully flexible one, empowering market forces to dictate the value of ETB 
against foreign currencies. The NBE will no longer directly intervene to set the exchange rate. 
The Ethiopian birr is now allowed to fluctuate more freely in response to changes in market 
conditions, such as trade flows, capital movements, and investor sentiment. 
• Elimination of foreign exchange surrender requirements to the NBE: The policy allows 
exporters and commercial banks to keep foreign exchange, significantly increasing foreign 
exchange supplies to the private sector. 
• Removal of import restrictions: The import restrictions imposed on 38 product categories 
have been lifted, and the foreign exchange market has been liberalized for the imports of goods 
and services except for fuel-powered cars while capital account outflows remain restricted as 
before. 
• The improvement of retention rules: Exporters are now permitted to retain 50% of their 
foreign exchange earnings, a significant increase from the previous 40% limit. This provision 
is designed to provide exporters with greater flexibility in managing their foreign exchange 
resources. 
• Removal of rules governing forex rationing: The policy abolished the previous system of 
bank-imposed rules governing the allocation and rationing of foreign exchange, which often

    5 
relied on waiting lists for various import categories. This reform was aimed to streamline the 
foreign exchange allocation process and promote greater efficiency in the foreign exchange 
market.  
• The introduction of non-bank foreign exchange bureaus: Formal non-bank foreign 
exchange bureaus have been authorized to operate and are now permitted to buy and sell 
foreign currency cash notes at market rates following the acquisition of necessary licenses. 
This policy change aims to increase competition and improve efficiency in the foreign 
exchange market. By October 02, the NBE granted operational licenses to five non-bank 
foreign exchange bureaus. These bureaus are expected to play a significant role in further 
developing and deepening Ethiopia’s foreign exchange market. 
•  The removal of restrictions on Franco Valuta imports: It has been mentioned that this was 
to be implemented shortly through an upcoming regulation. Accordingly, on August 19, 2024, 
the Ministry of Finance relaxed restrictions on Franco Valuta imports, allowing a wider variety 
of goods to enter Ethiopia without requiring the use of the domestic banking system for foreign 
currency transactions. This policy adjustment is a key component of the government's broader 
economic reforms designed to simplify import procedures and alleviate foreign currency 
shortages. While the ban on fuel-powered vehicles and security equipment remains in place, 
the new directive eliminates the need for Letters of Credit or other traditional payment 
methods for a wider range of imported goods. Previously, Franco Valuta was limited to 
essential items such as edible oil, rice, sugar, and baby formula. 
• The allowance for residents to open foreign currency accounts: The reform allows 
residents to open foreign currency accounts based on remittance inflows, transfers from 
abroad, forex-based salary or rental income, and for other specified cases, as well as the ability 
to use such foreign currency accounts for foreign service payments. 
• Relaxation of foreign exchange controls: Certain restrictions on foreign exchange 
transactions have been relaxed to promote greater convertibility and facilitate trade and 
investment. 
Before the current reform, the NBE set the daily exchange rate according to a schedule targeting 
a particular devaluation at the end of the period. The NBE would often buy or sell foreign currency 
to stabilize the exchange rate or achieve specific policy objectives. This intervention limited the 
flexibility of the exchange rate to respond to market forces. However, the current reform limits 
NBE’s intervention, and the rate is envisaged to be determined by the interaction of market forces 
(Tasew, Lamessa, and Arega, 2024). 
2.3. 
Exchange Rate Developments after the Reform: Accelerated Depreciation 
The July 2024 exchange rate reform in Ethiopia marked a significant shift in the country's 
economic policy. The move, largely supported by the IMF, was aimed at addressing the 
longstanding gap between the official and parallel exchange rates, which had distorted the 
economy and hindered trade growth.  
The ETB experienced a significant depreciation against major currencies like the US Dollar 
following the reform. It is rapidly weakening against the USD. The exchange rate has risen from 
Quarterly Macroeconomic Update 
Volume 9 Number 03 
 
October 2024 
 
    6 
ETB 57.8 per dollar on July 30, 2024, to 117.3 on September 15, 2024. During the same period, 
analyzing the daily exchange rate movements, the ETB depreciated by nearly 102.8% between 
July 30, 2024, and September 15, 2024. This suggests that the ETB has depreciated by about 2.3 
percent daily (Figure 1). This directly resulted from the shift to a market-based exchange rate 
system. 
Figure 1: Trend of average daily exchange rates 
 
Source: Computation based on data from Exchange Rates UK (2024) available at 
https://www.exchangerates.org.uk/USD-ETB-spot-exchange-rates-history-2024.html  
Figure 1 shows the daily exchange rate of the ETB against the US Dollar (USD) from July 29, 
2024, to September 15, 2024. The exchange rate was more volatile in the early days of the reform. 
It sharply increased until August 15, 2024, followed by a slight decrease, and then showed a further 
increment from August 30 onwards. The official exchange rate gradually increased throughout the 
period, reaching its highest point on September 15, 2024. The official rate experienced 
considerable depreciation after the reform where ETB has lost more than 100% of its value against 
the US dollar, requiring more ETB to buy one USD. The depreciation rate was exceedingly high.  
Despite the accelerated depreciation, the exchange rate seems nearly stable in September. As the 
underlying causes of the stable exchange rate in September have not been thoroughly investigated, 
some speculate that reduced demand for foreign exchange by importers may be a contributing 
factor.  
Despite significant dollar allocations by the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE), Ethiopian 
import and export traders are hesitant to utilize foreign currency from banks. For example, 
between July 22 and September 30, 2024, CBE disbursed over USD 282 million to various sectors, 
but businesses have only utilized 28% of these funds. This reluctance persists even though dollars 
are available at lower rates than those on the parallel market. According to the insight from 
Quarterly Macroeconomic Update 
Volume 9 Number 03 
 
October 2024 
 
    7 
Addisinsight magazine2, this low uptake underscores the gap between the availability of foreign 
exchange and the traders' capacity or willingness to access it.  
The ongoing economic slowdown and inflation have dampened demand for imports, reducing the 
market's appeal for traders. Even with foreign exchange available at lower rates, many importers 
are concerned about weak consumer demand, which could lead to unsold inventory and 
unprofitable investments. In addition to the challenges posed by the economic slowdown, 
Ethiopia's tight monetary policy has further constrained access to forex for traders. The central 
bank's efforts to curb inflation and stabilize the economy through measures such as high interest 
rates have resulted in reduced liquidity in the domestic market. This liquidity crunch has made it 
difficult for businesses to secure the necessary local currency to settle foreign exchange payments, 
hindering their ability to import essential goods and services. Overall, many traders are either 
unable to secure the necessary Birr for pre-payments or are unwilling to assume the risks 
associated with the economic slowdown and volatile exchange rates. 
The accelerated depreciation in the post-reform period appears to be the result of the rapid 
unification of the exchange rate suggested by the World Bank and the IMF amidst the critical 
shortage of forex in the country and the much-limited supply of forex compared to the rising 
demand. Considering this, the government wanted a more phased approach to correct the 
distortion. The important lesson from the experience of many countries, including Egypt and 
Nigeria, is to have abundant FX cushions to protect the currency during devaluation (UNDP, 
2024). 
Following the accelerated depreciation of the ETB and the increasing demand for foreign currency 
(US dollar) in the banking sector, the NBE made an auction on August 7, 2024. In an official 
statement, the NBE stated that the Special Auction saw the participation of 27 banks. The weighted 
average rate of all successful bids was Birr 107.9 per US Dollar (https://nbe.gov.et/fx-sale-
auction/). NBE’s Governor Mamo Mihretu made the following statement after the auction results 
were announced, 
“We are pleased to see a substantial narrowing of the gap between bank exchange rates 
and parallel market rates over the past week, as well as meaningful progress towards 
exchange rate stability. This is precisely what our macroeconomic reforms intended to 
achieve—namely to ensure that most FX transaction activity can shift to the banking 
system, thereby helping both exporters bringing in foreign exchange as well as the 
many companies and entrepreneurs seeking foreign exchange.” 
The Governor also welcomed the encouraging growth seen in the volume of FX transactions and 
noted:  
“We are also pleased to see a growing number of banks making foreign exchange 
available to their customers by approving past import requests and accepting new

banks-despite-cash-availability-at-lower-rates/

Volume 9 Number 03 
 
October 2024 
 
    8 
import requests; we anticipate and indeed expect more banks will follow this trend over 
the coming weeks and that they will do so with increasingly larger FX volumes.” 
Though the volume of transactions is not stated, the NBE’s auctions are instrumental in addressing 
forex liquidity shortages within the banking system, narrowing the disparity between the official 
exchange rate and the parallel market rate, and promoting exchange rate stability. By strategically 
allocating foreign currency through these auctions, the NBE can effectively supply forex to the 
banking sector, manage the rising demand for foreign exchange, and stabilize the foreign exchange 
market.  
NBE’s intervention is in line with the agreement with the IMF. According to the IMF (2024), 
intervention in the foreign exchange market will be limited to stemming disorderly market 
conditions and malpractices. The NBE has approved an FX intervention strategy (including a 
governance process) that allows but does not oblige, the NBE to buy or sell foreign currency in 
volatile market conditions. Any FX intervention is agreed to be conducted via a public auction 
open to all banks. The Program highlights that NBE may conduct a limited number of low-value 
FX sale auctions during the two months immediately after the change of the FX regime to support 
price discovery, consistent with the framework. These policies support the objective of restoring 
foreign exchange reserves to adequate levels to reduce external vulnerabilities, by the end of the 
program. 
In addition, as a transitional measure to facilitate clearance of pre-existing obligations for fuel 
imports until the Ethiopia Petroleum Supply Enterprise has had time to build up adequate FX by 
regular purchases at the market rate, NBE may use a maximum of US$670 million to settle LCs 
for fuel imports that fall due in July and August 2024. Such payments, to be made at the prevailing 
market exchange rate, would not be subject to the FX intervention framework (IMF, 2024). 
2.4. 
 Exchange Rate Gap in the Official and Parallel Markets 
Over the past years, the exchange rate has been significantly misaligned. The significant gap in 
the exchange rate has been one of the biggest distortions harming the nation’s economy. This 
misalignment was indicated by the large gap between the official and black-market exchange rates. 
For instance, as of September 30, 2023, the official market rate was ETB 55.2 per dollar, while 
the parallel market traded on average, at over ETB 112 per dollar, resulting in a gap of about 103% 
(EEA, 2024a).  
Ethiopia's foreign exchange reform introduced in late July 2024 marked a significant shift in its 
economic policy. By liberalizing its currency market, the government aimed to align the official 
exchange rate with market forces, reducing the gap between the official rate and the black-market 
rate. The ETB depreciated significantly, bringing the official rate closer to the black-market rate, 
and significantly reducing the exchange rate misalignment. 
Following the reform, the exchange rate gap decreased from over ETB 65 per US dollar (112.5%) 
on July 29, 2024, to just ETB 6 per dollar (5.3%) on September 06, 2024, and stabilized around 
ETB 10 (9.6%) for most of the post-reform period (Figure 2). The narrowing gap may encourage 
using official market channels for currency exchange in the country. This is in line with the goal 
Quarterly Macroeconomic Update 
Volume 9 Number 03

    9 
of the reform. One of the key aspects of the macroeconomic reform program was the 
implementation of a market-based exchange rate, unifying official and parallel foreign exchange 
(FX) markets, to help address external imbalances and relieve FX shortages (IMF, 2024). 
Figure 2: Official and Parallel Exchange Rates (ETB/USD), some selected days during July-
September 2024

spot-exchange-rates-history-2023.html and https://ethioblackmarket.com  
Though the difference between the official and parallel rates tends to decline gradually, the parallel 
exchange rate fluctuated throughout the period. It started at a relatively high level on July 29, then 
experienced a slight decline before rebounding to a new high on September 16, 2024. There have 
been periods of divergence, suggesting considerable disparities between the official and parallel 
markets due to strong demand for foreign currency on the black market. For instance, as of 
September 16, 2024, the parallel rate was significantly higher than the official rate. The parallel 
market exchange rate surged to ETB 132.4 per dollar. This sharp increase follows some banks 
implementing a 16% bonus on their remittance buying rates, which initially seemed to attract more 
foreign currency through the banking channel. However, instead of narrowing the gap, the parallel 
rate increased significantly. With demand increasing and forex supply not keeping pace despite 
bank incentives, people may be turning more to the black market to obtain foreign currency.  The 
difference between the official and parallel exchange rates decreased significantly during the 
period but then increased again on September 16, 2024. This shows that the gap between the 
exchange rate set by the banks and the rate at which ETB is traded in the parallel market is 
gradually narrowing after the reform. This suggests some success in aligning the official rate with 
market realities. 
Apart from the limited availability of foreign exchange in the formal market, other factors may 
influence the preference for the parallel market. The process of obtaining foreign currency through 
official channels can be time-consuming, involving multiple bureaucratic steps and paperwork. 
Quarterly Macroeconomic Update

Banks may take significant time to process applications and disburse funds, leading to delays in 
import operations. Moreover, the rigorous documentation requirement from banks can be a 
burdensome and time-consuming process. 
2.5. 
Variation in the Buying and Selling Rates across Banks  
The exchange rate reform in Ethiopia has significantly altered the competitive landscape for 
foreign currency buying and selling among Ethiopian banks. Introducing a market-based 
exchange rate system has opened opportunities for banks to compete more aggressively in pricing 
and services. Moving away from a ‘managed’ floating exchange rate regime has allowed banks to 
set their own buying and selling rates based on market conditions. Given the shortage of foreign 
currency, this has intensified competition among banks to attract customers with attractive rates. 
With more flexibility in pricing, banks have been incentivized to compete more aggressively for 
foreign exchange business. This has led to a gradual increment in spreads between buying and 
selling rates. 
Figure 3 shows the ranking of Ethiopian commercial banks based on their buying rates for the 
Ethiopian Birr (ETB) against the US Dollar (USD) on September 16, 2024. The DBE, Bunna 
International Bank, and Addis International Bank lead the ranking sector with the highest buying 
rates at ETB116.01, 115, and 112.44 per USD, respectively. A cluster of banks occupy the middle 
of the ranking with buying rates ranging from ETB 112.01 per USD to ETB 109 per USD. This 
group includes banks such as Wegagen Bank, Berhan International Bank, Global Bank, Goh Bank, 
and Siinqee Bank. At the lower end of the ranking are banks such as Hibret Bank, Amhara Bank, 
Tsehay Bank, Oromia International Bank, and NIB, with buying rates ranging from ETB 106 per 
USD to 108.9 per USD. 
Notwithstanding the competition among Ethiopian banks in terms of offering a favorable buying 
rate for their customers, there is a significant variation in selling rates across Ethiopian banks, 
ranging from a low of ETB 106 for Hibret Bank to a high of 116 for DBE, indicating a modest 
gap of ETB 10. It highlights the variations in buying rates offered by different banks. 
The foreign exchange market in Ethiopia has been marked by significant volatility, with exchange 
rates fluctuating frequently. A key driver of this volatility has been the disparity in buying and 
selling rates among different banks. To attract customers and optimize their foreign currency 
holdings, banks have adjusted their rates competitively.

While other factors such as economic uncertainty and domestic economic policies may influence 
exchange rates, the primary driver has been the intense competition among banks to acquire 
foreign currency deposits. In the evolving market landscape, banks have sought to differentiate 
themselves by offering attractive exchange rates to customers. 
Figure 4 shows the ranking of commercial banks in Ethiopia based on their selling rates for the 
US Dollar (USD) against ETB on September 16, 2024. Some key observations from the graph 
show that Bunna International Bank leads the ranking with the highest selling rate at 124.91 
ETB/USD. Zamzam Bank and Tsedey Bank follow closely with selling rates of 124.44 ETB/USD 
and 123.15 ETB/USD, respectively. A cluster of banks occupies the middle of the ranking with 
selling rates ranging from 122.77 ETB/USD to 121.09 ETB/USD. This group includes prominent 
banks like Oromia International Bank, Awash Bank, Addis International Bank, Wegagen Bank, 
and Berhan International Bank. At the lower end of the ranking are banks such as Nib International 
Bank, Global Bank, Gadaa Bank, Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE), Hibret Bank, and Tsedey, 
with selling rates ranging from 120.81 ETB/USD to 116 ETB/USD.

Figure 4 reveals tight competition among Ethiopian banks in terms of exchange rates. There is a 
significant variation in selling rates across Ethiopian banks, ranging from a low of ETB 116 to a 
high of about 125, indicating a gap of ETB 9. The graph provides valuable insights into the 
exchange rate landscape in Ethiopia and the competitive dynamics among commercial banks. It 
highlights the variations in selling rates offered by different banks and allows businesses and 
individuals to make informed decisions when exchanging currency.  
Both buying and selling rates indicate that there are variations in the buying and selling exchange 
rates among different banks. Overall, as of September 16, 2024, the bank with the lowest buy rate 
was Hibret Bank, with a rate of ETB 106 while the bank with the highest buy rate was Bunna 
Bank, with a rate of ETB 116. The bank with the lowest sell rate was Tsehay Bank, with a rate of 
ETB 116 while the bank with the highest sell rate was Bunna, with a rate of ETB 124.91. These 
variations may be influenced by factors such as the bank's size, reputation, and foreign currency 
reserves.  
2.6. 
Foreign Exchange Trading Spread 
Following the implementation of the new regulations, there is evidence that banks are widening 
the gap between their buying and selling rates, often called ‘bid-ask spread’. Foreign exchange 
spread refers to the difference between the price at which a currency dealer such as a bank is 
willing to buy a currency (also known as bid price) and the price at which they are willing to sell 
it (ask price). Essentially, it's the transaction cost of buying or selling a currency.

Figure 5 presents the differential between the average buying and selling rates of foreign exchange 
at Ethiopian banks. It shows that there appears to be a general upward trend in both the buying 
and selling rates of the US dollar throughout the period. This suggests that the ETB was 
depreciating against the US dollar. The overall trend of the exchange rate spread is upward, 
indicating that the difference between the buying and selling rates for the US dollar has been 
increasing over time. The most significant increase in the selling and buying spread occurred 
between August 9th and August 16th. The spread jumped from around ETB 5 to ETB 10 during 
this period. After the peak in mid-August, the spread remained relatively stable, hovering around 
ETB 11-12. While there is an overall upward trend, there are periods of minor fluctuations at both 
rates.

Figure 5 demonstrates that the initial buying-selling exchange rate spread to the US dollar 
following the exchange rate reform averaged approximately ETB 1.63 in the first few days of 
August 2024. However, this spread experienced a significant increase, reaching ETB 5.75 by the 
end of the first week of the month. This upward trend continued to accelerate, culminating in a 
peak of ETB 10.4 between the 9th and 16th of August 2024. While the spread experienced a slight 
increase from the 17th of August to the 16th of September, it remained relatively stable at around 
ETB 11.6 during this period. 
The average spread between the buying and selling rates has widened over the period under 
review. This generally indicates a higher profit margin for the banks involved in foreign exchange 
transactions. While there have been minor fluctuations, the overall difference between the buying 
and selling rates has remained relatively consistent, suggesting that banks have maintained a 
Quarterly Macroeconomic Update 
Volume 9 Number 03 
 
October 2024 
 
    14 
consistent profit margin. The difference between the bid and ask price represents the dealer's profit 
on each transaction. Thus, a wider spread means that banks are making a higher potential profit 
per trade. 
The high and widening exchange rate spread in Ethiopia's foreign currency market, particularly 
after the reform, can be attributed to the chronic shortage of foreign exchange and the few sources 
of foreign currency. Such limited supply in the presence of unmet demand drives up prices. The 
shortage of foreign exchange is primarily due to the high import demand and the limited export 
earnings generated in the economy. For instance, exports from October 2023 to December 2023 
totaled only $770 million, exhibiting a 7.5% decline from $833.1 million in the previous quarter. 
During the same period, total merchandise import bills amounted to $4.8 billion on 31 December 
2023. As a result, in the last quarter of 2023, the country had a merchandise trade deficit of about 
$4.3 billion (EEA, 2024b). A related issue is the relatively new or underdeveloped foreign 
exchange market with limited liquidity and tougher competition to secure the few available forex, 
leading to wider spreads. The competition among banks to attract foreign currency is leading to 
aggressive efforts to meet customers' needs and generate profits. This competition can drive up 
the prices that banks offer to buy foreign currency, resulting in wider spreads between the buying 
and selling rates. Ethiopia's transition to a market-based exchange rate system offers greater 
flexibility and efficiency but may also result in increased volatility and wider spreads. What is 
more, uncertainty about the future direction of the economy coupled with macroeconomic 
instability or uncertainty can lead to increased volatility and wider spreads. 
The agreement with the IMF allows for interventions to stabilize the market. The NBE adopted a 
foreign exchange intervention (FXI) strategy. Under the FXI strategy, the NBE can but is not 
obliged to intervene to stem disorderly movements in the exchange rate (IMF, 2024). Accordingly, 
the NBE may have room to intervene to narrow excessive exchange rate spreads. 
In Uganda, Central Bank regulations limit the bid-ask spread to 10 shillings; anything beyond that 
is penalized. In Malawi, maximum spreads between buying and selling exchange rates are set at 
2% for Telegraphic Transfer (TT) and 3% for cash. In Zambia, the difference between the buying 
price (bid price) and the selling price (ask price) of a currency should not exceed 0.05 Zambian 
Kwacha. On the other hand, in Kenya and Sierra Leone, authorized dealers freely determine their 
bid-ask spreads and foreign exchange commissions in transactions with their clients (European 
Investment Bank, 2022). By learning from the experiences of other developing/African countries, 
the NBE can implement appropriate regulations to ensure fair pricing and foster a more 
competitive and efficient foreign exchange market.

International Trade Developments 
This section offers a comprehensive overview of Ethiopia’s international trade performance during 
the third quarter of the 2023/2024 Ethiopian fiscal year (January to March 2024). It examines the 
composition of Ethiopia’s exports, including agricultural products and manufactured goods as well 
as the countries to which these exports are primarily shipped. Additionally, the analysis delves 
into the types of goods Ethiopia imports, their origins, and the country’s trade balance. By 
exploring these key aspects, this analysis provides a nuanced understanding of Ethiopia’s external 
trade dynamics during the review quarter. 
 
 
 
Key facts and figures 
• During the review quarter, Ethiopia exported goods worth only $784.3 million, 
demonstrating a modest growth of 1.7% nominal value from the previous quarter.  
• Coffee held the top position, contributing 31.5% of the total merchandise export revenue, 
followed by oil seeds (21.13%) and cut flowers (16.2%). 
• The Netherlands is the top destination for Ethiopian exports, accounting for 11% of the 
total value, followed by UAE (9.6%) and Saudi Arabia (9.13%). 
• Saudi Arabia was the top destination for Ethiopian coffee exports, accounting for nearly 
19% of the total. Belgium (9.4%) and the United States (9.13%) followed closely. 
• The UAE is the top destination for Ethiopian oil seed exports, accounting for 27.85% of 
the total. Israel and Türkiye follow, with shares of 17% and 11.6%, respectively.

3.1. 
Export Performance 
During the review quarter from January to March 2024, Ethiopia exported goods totaled only 
$784.3 million. Exports experienced a slight increase in nominal terms, indicating a limited 
growth of 1.7% from the previous quarter ($770.7 million). The size of the country’s exports is 
tiny relative to the country’s economic size and that of import demand. According to the IMF, 
Ethiopia's merchandise exports totaled $4.27 billion in 2023, with earnings declining by about 
15% compared to 2022. In 2004, exports of goods and services accounted for 6.7% of GDP in 
2023. This is considerably far below the SSA average (24.9%) and countries in Eastern Africa 
such as Kenya (34%), Uganda (36%), Somalia (96%), and Djibouti (340%) (EEA, 2024c).   
The country has faced several challenges in boosting its export performance. One of the major 
factors is its dependency on the export of primary commodities. Ethiopia's exports are heavily 
reliant on primary commodities like coffee, oilseeds and pulses, and livestock and livestock 
products. The country’s heavy reliance on agriculture and primary commodities has remained 
unchanged over the past several decades. This makes the country vulnerable to global price and 
demand shocks. Exporting raw materials generally yields lower revenues compared to processed 
or manufactured goods. On the other hand, exporting processed agricultural products rather than 
raw commodities benefits society much more than just the increased value of the commodities 
themselves. Processing adds to the value of the products and generates greater business activity, 
more jobs, higher personal income, and greater tax revenues (Gerald and William,1989). More 
importantly, manufactured products are relatively more competitive in the international market, 
leading to more stable prices and export earnings. 
Apart from the export structure, political instability and lingering conflicts in Ethiopia disrupt 
trade routes and create security risks for businesses, deterring the production and supply of 
exportable items. 
3.1.1. Major Exports 
Table 1 reveals that coffee is the country's leading export, contributing 31.5% of the total 
merchandise export revenue. This highlights Ethiopia's heavy dependence on coffee for foreign 
exchange and demonstrates the commodity’s crucial role in the economy. Following coffee, 
oilseeds account for 21.13% of exports while cut flowers represent 16.2%. Notably, cut flowers 
rank as Ethiopia's third-largest export product, and the floriculture sector serves as a major source 
of employment, particularly for women. Pulses, Chats, textiles and garments are also significant 
contributors to export revenue generation. In summary, the data on Ethiopia's top ten export 
products provides a valuable snapshot of the country's export. The data suggests that Ethiopia has 
a strong presence in the global market for coffee, oilseeds, and flowers. 
In terms of the commodity composition, Ethiopia’s exports are heavily reliant on agriculture, with 
the top five agricultural products—coffee, oilseeds, flowers, pulses, and chat—accounting for 
85.4% of total merchandise exports. This may suggest the significance of agriculture in Ethiopia’s 
economy. However, the prevalence of agricultural goods in the export basket tends to expose the 
country to volatility of prices and earnings.

Coffee remains the cornerstone of Ethiopia's export sector and continues to play a crucial role in 
the economy. The country's reputation for producing high-quality coffee contributes to its 
competitiveness in the global market. Maintaining and enhancing coffee production quality and 
sustainability is crucial for the country's export growth. 
While coffee is the dominant commodity, the presence of other significant agricultural goods in 
the export basket indicates some degree of export diversification, at least within the agricultural 
sector. Diversifying exports can reduce reliance on a single product and help mitigate risks. 
Expanding exports of other agricultural products, such as oil seeds, flowers, and pulses, and 
manufacturing goods can contribute to export growth. Additionally, the presence of goods such as 
textiles and garments reveals potential for growth in the manufacturing sector. Although Ethiopia 
has been suspended from the AGOA, nearly half of textiles and garments exports (48.2%) are still 
destined for the USA market. This can help mitigate risks associated with relying heavily on a 
single commodity.  
3.1.2. Destinations of Exports 
In 2023, Ethiopia exported to about 153 destinations worldwide (EEA, 2024b). Table 2 outlines 
Ethiopia's top 10 export destinations during the review quarter, based on their value in million 
USD. The Netherlands is the top destination for Ethiopian exports, accounting for 11% of the total 
value. This suggests strong trade ties and a developed market for Ethiopian products. Middle 
Eastern markets, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia are important markets for Ethiopian exports, each 
representing around 9% of the total value. This indicates a growing demand for Ethiopian products 
in the Middle East. Somalia and Djibouti, both neighboring countries, are among the top 10 export 
destinations, highlighting the potential for increased regional trade. The top 10 destinations

Table 2 suggests regional trade importance. Ethiopia's trade is heavily concentrated in the Middle 
East and Africa, highlighting the importance of proximity. The Netherlands and the United Arab 
Emirates have established strong trade relationships with Ethiopia, making them key markets for 
Ethiopian exports. While the Middle East and Africa are dominant at 34.5% of the top ten export 
destinations, the presence of other destinations like the United States and India indicates a degree 
of export diversification in commodity destinations, reducing reliance on any single region. The 
presence of countries like Somalia and Djibouti suggests opportunities for increased trade within 
the East African region and regional integration.  
3.1.3. Major Exports by Destination 
Table 3 outlines Ethiopia's top 10 coffee export destinations during the first quarter of 2024, based 
on their value in million USD. During the review quarter, coffee was exported to about 53 
destinations. Saudi Arabia emerged as the primary destination for Ethiopia’s coffee exports, 
accounting for nearly 19% of total coffee exports. Most of Ethiopia's top coffee export destinations 
are in the Middle East and Asia, indicating Ethiopia’s strong market presence in these regions. 
While Saudi Arabia is the leading destination, the presence of other countries like Belgium, the 
United States, and Germany demonstrates a diversified export destination. It suggests a strong 
global demand for Ethiopian coffee.

accounting for 27.95% of the total exports. Israel is the second largest destination, with a share of 
17%. Turky, Singapore, and Vietnam follow in the third, fourth, and fifth positions. These five 
destinations together account for about 75% of Ethiopia's oil seeds exports in the quarter. This 
suggests that Ethiopia's oil seeds exports are concentrated in a relatively small number of markets. 
It is also worth noting that the value of exports to each destination varies significantly, with the 
United Arab Emirates receiving almost three times as much as Vietnam. 
Table 5 shows the top five destinations for Ethiopia's cut flower exports in terms of the value of

Ethiopia holds 2% of the global market share in flower exports, making it the sixth-largest flower 
exporter in the world, following Belgium. The country is currently the second largest flower 
exporter in Africa after Kenya3.

The Netherlands is the primary destination for Ethiopia's cut flower exports, accounting for nearly 
64% of the total value. This suggests a strong market presence and established trade relationships. 
The next two largest markets are Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom, each representing around 
10% and 5% of the total flower exports, respectively. The United Arab Emirates and the United 
States, while smaller than the top three, still hold significant shares of 3.12% and 3%, respectively. 
Cut flower exports tend to have a European market focus. The Netherlands, being a major hub for 
the global flower trade, plays a pivotal role in Ethiopia's exports. This suggests that Ethiopia may 
need to diversify its export markets to reduce reliance on the European market. The data also 
shows that Saudi Arabia's position as the second-largest destination highlights the growing 
demand for cut flowers in the Middle East. This region presents opportunities for further 
expansion. Moreover, the presence of the United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, and the United 
States in the top five indicates that Ethiopian cut flowers have the potential to reach various global 
markets. However, increased marketing efforts and trade promotion may be necessary to tap into 
these markets more effectively. Overall, the data suggests that Ethiopia has a strong foundation in 
the global cut flower market, but strategic expansion and diversification are essential to sustain its 
growth and competitiveness. 
Table 6 displays the top five destinations for Ethiopia's pulse exports in the first quarter of 2024. 
It includes the value of exports in million USD and the share of each destination in the total exports 
of the commodity. India is the primary destination for Ethiopia's pulse exports, accounting for 
over 25% of the total value. Pakistan follows India as the second largest destination. This suggests 
a strong market presence and established trade relationships with these two Asian countries. Sudan 
and Kenya, both neighboring countries, are significant markets for Ethiopian pulses, each 
representing around 9.2% and 7% of the total exports, respectively. 
Ethiopia's pulse exports are heavily concentrated in Asian markets, particularly India, Pakistan, 
and Turkey, suggesting that diversifying export destinations can reduce potential risks and 
enhance market stability. The data also demonstrates there are regional trade opportunities in 
Africa. The strong presence of Sudan and Kenya as major destinations highlights the potential for 
increased trade within the African continent. Ethiopia could explore opportunities to expand its 
exports to other African countries with a growing demand for pulses. Since the product is exported

Chat exports data reveal that there is strong regional trade dependence. Ethiopia's Chat exports 
are heavily reliant on neighboring countries, particularly Somalia and Djibouti. This dependence 
can make the industry vulnerable to political instability or changes in trade policies in these 
regions. The limited geographical spread of Chat exports indicates that the product is consumed 
in a limited number of countries and is illegal in many countries. This poses significant challenges 
to the commodity’s international trade.

percentage of GDP have been higher than the SSA average until 2016 when imports averaged 
31.8% while SSA’s was 28%. However, the country’s imports declined in the post-2016 period, 
declining from 27.9% in 2016 to 14.3% in 2023. Moreover, between 2004 and 2023, imports as a 
percentage of GDP dropped by 53.7 percentage points from 31% in 2004 to 14.4% in 2023. 
However, the share of imports of goods and services in the SSA increased from 24.8% in 2004 to 
28.4% in 2023. 
The decline in the value of imports and its share of GDP since 2016 might be possibly linked to 
rising global commodity prices, disruptions in global supply chains, such as those caused by 
COVID-19, limited availability and depletion of foreign exchange reserves, conflict and the 
slowdown in economic activity. 
3.2.1. Major Imports 
According to the Ethiopian Statistical Service (ESS) (2024), the value of merchandise imports 
into Ethiopia during the third quarter (July-September 2024) reached a significant high of $6.2 
billion4. This represents a substantial increase of 29.2% compared to the previous quarter 
(October-December 2023). Notably, this translates to a growth of $4.2 billion in import value 
within a single quarter. 
Despite the severe shortage of foreign exchange affecting traders in the official market and the 
depletion of the country's foreign currency reserves, the value of imports increased significantly. 
Apart from demonstrating the growing demand for imports, this surge may be attributed to the 
fact that, in addition to the foreign currency available through official channels, importers were 
also accessing foreign exchange from the black market. 
Figure 6 indicates the top ten imports of Ethiopia disaggregated at the HS 8-digit level. Ethiopia's 
imports are dominated by mineral or chemical fertilizers, palm oil, aircraft parts, sugar, urea, and 
rice, which together account for 17.4% of total imports. Other important imports include turbojets, 
wheat, and fertilizers. 
Ethiopia is a net importer of agricultural inputs, including fertilizers. Fertilizer is Ethiopia’s top 
import commodity.  For instance, the share of imports of mineral or chemical fertilizers is 
relatively high at 4.7%. This suggests that the country's agriculture is increasingly dependent on 
imported inputs, which could make it vulnerable to supply-chain disruptions and fluctuations in 
global prices. The country also depends on imported agricultural products such as wheat, and rice, 
and processed agricultural outputs such as palm oil. Food products, such as rice, palm oil, and 
sugar, constitute a significant portion of Ethiopia's imports. This indicates a dependence on foreign 
sources for food supply, which could be vulnerable to global market fluctuations. This is likely 
attributed to a confluence of factors, including the domestic agriculture sector's limited productive 
capacity, which has hindered the sufficient production of essential agricultural goods. Moreover,

Ethiopia's growing population and the country's reliance on imported fertilizers have further 
exacerbated the need for agricultural imports.

Ethiopia's significant imports of aircraft parts underscore its substantial investment in the aviation 
sector. Aircraft and aircraft parts together accounted for approximately 4.3% of total merchandise 
imports during the review quarter, indicating a strong commitment to expanding and modernizing 
the country's aviation infrastructure. This strategic focus on aviation has positioned Ethiopian 
Airlines as a key player in the global airline industry and a significant contributor to Ethiopia's 
foreign exchange earnings. The airline's extensive international network and growing fleet of 
modern aircraft have solidified its reputation as a reliable and efficient carrier, attracting both 
domestic and international travelers. 
While the top 10 products represent a significant portion of Ethiopia's imports, the relatively small 
share of each product indicates a diversified import basket, reducing the country's vulnerability to 
fluctuations in the price of any single commodity.

3.2.2. Major Origins of Imports 
Figure 7 shows the top 10 countries from which Ethiopia imports goods in the review quarter.  
Figure 7: Top 10 origins of imports (% share in total imports), Jan-Mar. 2024  
Source: Computation based on data from ESS (2024) 
China is Ethiopia's largest import source, accounting for 38.5% of total imports. This suggests a 
significant reliance on Chinese goods and services. India follows China, accounting for 11.1% of 
Ethiopia's imports, making it the second-largest source. Morocco contributes 6.2% of Ethiopia's 
imports, becoming the third most important source of goods. 
The majority of the top 10 import origins (six) are in Asia, accounting for nearly 63% of total 
merchandise imports. This highlights the region's importance as a supplier of goods to Ethiopia. 
While China dominates, there is also a significant share of imports from other African countries, 
such as Morocco (6.2%) and Egypt (2.5%). This indicates that Ethiopia engages in regional trade, 
which can contribute to economic integration and development. Although China is the primary 
source, Ethiopia imports from a range of countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. 
Such diversified sources can help mitigate risks associated with reliance on a single supplier. 
Figure 7 suggests that there is considerable trade dependence. Ethiopia's reliance on imports, 
particularly from China, suggests a need to diversify its supply sources and promote domestic 
production to reduce trade dependence. On the other hand, the presence of African countries in 
the top 10 import origins indicates opportunities for further regional economic integration and 
cooperation. A significant proportion of imports (63%) are sourced from Asia. This entails that 
diversifying import sources can help improve supply chain resilience and mitigate the impact of 
global economic shocks. 
3.3. 
Trade Balance 
Ethiopia’s trade balance has been negative and widening over the past two decades, suggesting 
that imports have consistently exceeded its export earnings. For instance, in 2001, the trade deficit 
was $1.35 billion. The deficit demonstrated strong growth over the years, reaching an all-time

high of $14.6 billion in 2022. However, there was a modest improvement in 2023, with the deficit 
declining to $14.2 billion (EEAb, 2024).  
Ethiopia exported goods worth $784.3 million while importing goods worth $6.18 billion in the 
review quarter. This led to a significant trade deficit of $5.39 billion in the review quarter 
compared to $4.3 billion in the previous quarter, suggesting that imports far exceeded exports in 
value. The trade deficit was nearly seven times larger than the value of goods exported. The 
increment in the trade deficit was mainly due to the significant growth in imports relative to the 
modest growth in exports. 
Ethiopia’s trade balance during the review quarter reveals a substantial deficit. This suggests that 
the country’s export size is tiny and heavily reliant on imports to meet domestic demand and 
industrial needs. This dependence could make the country vulnerable to global economic 
fluctuations and supply chain disruptions. 
The trade balance deficit continues primarily due to the small size of exports compared to the 
demand for imports and the significant increase in imports exceeding that of exports. The growth 
of imports is expected in an import-dependent and growing small economy. What is concerning 
is the small size and faltering export performance that contributes further to the widening of the 
trade deficit. Ethiopia’s export sector remains relatively small and has experienced slow growth. 
Perhaps, UNCTAD’s data shows that merchandise exports increased by only $750.8 million 
between 2012 and 2022. More concerning, Ethiopia’s export contribution to the GDP has been on 
a downward trajectory over the last decade. The size of exports of goods and services as a 
percentage of GDP declined significantly from 12.7% in 2013 to 6.7% in 2023. This is 
significantly below the 24% expected from a country the size of Ethiopia at its level of 
development (World Bank, 2017). 
In addition, Ethiopia’s chronic trade deficit reveals the problem associated with the structure of 
exports. Apart from the tiny size of exports, this imbalance may appear to suggest two key issues. 
First, it is linked to the type of goods that Ethiopia exports—low-value added primary 
commodities characterized by high price volatility in the global markets. Ethiopia’s exports are 
less complex products produced by most countries and less competitive in international markets. 
There is no adequate diversity and uniqueness of agricultural commodities to compete in 
international markets. They rather lead to high export earnings instability and widening trade 
deficits. Second, demand for imports outpaced export capacity. This might be explained by the 
lack of industrial capacity to manufacture diversified industrial goods (EEAb, 2024). 
To improve its trade balance, Ethiopia should focus on promoting exports and diversifying its 
export base. This could involve strategies such as diversifying the structure of exports, improving 
product quality, reducing export/trade costs through streamlining trade procedures, and exploring 
new markets. In addition, the trade deficit highlights the need for Ethiopia to develop its domestic 
industries and promote import substitution. By increasing domestic production and exports, 
Ethiopia can reduce its dependence on imports and strengthen its economy. Ethiopia can consider 
import substitution strategies to reduce its reliance on imports of essential agricultural products 
and basic consumption goods.  This could involve scaling up initiatives/ strategies such as 
Ethiopia Tamrit’ to mean ‘let Ethiopia produce’, and promoting domestic production of goods that 
are currently imported.

Conclusion  
Following the reform, the Ethiopian Birr significantly depreciates against the US dollar and other 
major currencies. Countries like Ethiopia, with insufficient foreign exchange reserves relative to 
rising forex demand, often face continuous depreciation of their local currency, particularly after 
floating their exchange rates. Factors such as limited foreign currency supply, currency 
speculation, economic uncertainty, and overall macroeconomic conditions continue to contribute 
to the rapid depreciation of the ETB. 
The rapid depreciation of the ETB has significantly narrowed the gap between the official and 
parallel foreign exchange rates. While the adoption of a floating exchange rate regime has further 
reduced this disparity, the parallel market has not been entirely eliminated. The narrowing parallel 
market premium indicates a convergence between the official and black-market exchange rates. 
This trend suggests that aligning the official exchange rate with macroeconomic and market 
fundamentals can partially balance the supply and demand for foreign exchange, thereby reducing 
the reliance on the parallel market.  
The analysis of the exchange rate spread in Ethiopia's foreign exchange market, particularly 
following the exchange rate reform, reveals a significant widening of the buy and selling rates 
spread. This trend is primarily driven by the persistent shortage of foreign exchange, limited 
export earnings, and high import demand. The resulting limited supply of foreign exchange has 
led to intense competition among banks. The underdeveloped foreign exchange market, 
characterized by limited liquidity, further exacerbates the situation. While the market-based 
exchange rate system offers potential benefits, it also introduces challenges, including increased 
volatility and wider spreads. Addressing these underlying issues, such as boosting export earnings, 
diversifying exports, and fostering a more developed foreign exchange market, is crucial to 
mitigating the negative impacts of a widening spread and stabilizing the exchange rate. Despite 
the volatility, the post-2024 exchange rate reform in Ethiopia has fostered a more competitive 
environment for foreign currency transactions among banks. While challenges persist, the 
potential benefits for both banks and customers are substantial. By offering competitive rates in 
line with NBE’s regulations, banks can enhance their market position and thrive in this new 
landscape. 
Encouraging more players to enter the foreign exchange market can help drive down buy-selling 
rate spreads. In this respect, the introduction of non-bank foreign exchange dealers could further 
intensify competition in the foreign exchange market, potentially leading to increased efficiency 
and a narrowing of the spread between official and parallel exchange rates. Alongside this, 
increasing the supply of forex into the economy from donors and remittances shall be emphasized 
as it is expected to play a critical role in stabilizing the foreign exchange market. 
The Ethiopian Birr is rapidly depreciating in the post-reform period. While a gradual approach to 
floating the exchange rate could have helped mitigate the excessive depreciation, and market 
volatility and allowed participants to adjust, the NBE may still need to intervene in the initial 
phases of the reform. The recent policy shift allows NBE to intervene in the foreign exchange 
market to address malpractices. Government intervention in currency markets is common to

mitigate exchange rate volatility's impact on inflation and output. Given this, it's crucial to avoid 
excessive depreciation of the ETB. Informed interventions can help prevent excessive 
depreciation, inflationary pressures, a widening trade deficit, socioeconomic crises, and the need 
for subsequent policy reversals. This intervention could involve injecting foreign exchange 
supplies through frequent or regular auctions to stabilize the market and prevent excessive 
volatility.  
Overall, the success of currency reforms in Ethiopia will hinge on the government's capacity to 
simultaneously address chronic supply shortages, ensure sustainable sources of forex, and 
significantly narrow, if not eliminate, the persistent gap between the official and black-market 
exchange rates.  
Moreover, effective implementation of these reforms will require a comprehensive approach that 
includes targeted interventions to boost domestic production and exports and foster a more 
competitive foreign exchange market. Additionally, the government must build trust and 
transparency in the financial system to encourage confidence in the domestic currency and reduce 
reliance on parallel markets. 
Ethiopia's exports are primarily driven by agricultural products. This highlights the need for 
continued investment in agricultural development and improvement of productivity to boost 
export performance. Aside from attracting capital and facilitating investment in agriculture, 
exploring opportunities to export value-added agricultural exports, such as processed coffee and 
oil seeds, can increase export earnings and create more jobs. The presence of exports like textiles 
and garments indicates potential for export diversification and growth in the manufacturing sector.  
Encouraging industrialization can contribute to exports, economic diversification, and job 
creation.  
Diversifying exports to other non-traditional agricultural and manufacturing exports may 
contribute to narrowing down trade deficit, and employment creation and help mitigate the 
significant risks of relying on a few agricultural commodities. 
In terms of destinations, Ethiopia's export landscape, while heavily concentrated in the Middle 
East and Africa, demonstrates a commendable degree of diversification across commodity 
destinations. The presence of significant exports to the United States and India underscores the 
country's efforts to reduce reliance on any single region. Ethiopia must continue to explore new 
markets, particularly in regions with high growth potential, such as Asia and Europe. Alongside 
market diversification, efforts to diversify export products beyond traditional commodities will 
enhance market resilience and reduce vulnerability to price fluctuations, ultimately contributing 
to sustained export growth. Strengthening regional trade relationships, particularly within the 
African continent, can create larger markets and economies of scale. 
Ethiopia's significant import surge during the review quarter, occurring amidst a severe foreign 
exchange shortage and small size of export earnings, underscores a growing demand for imports. 
This trend exacerbates the country's trade imbalance and exposes it to heightened vulnerabilities.

The reliance on imported fertilizers, food products, and essential goods exposes the country's 
limited domestic production capacity and weak agricultural sector. This, combined with a 
significant dependence on China as a supplier of imports, raises concerns about the potential 
downsides of reliance on a single source and suggests the need for diversification of import 
sources.  
Ethiopia needs to boost domestic production by prioritizing initiatives that increase domestic 
agricultural output and reduce reliance on imported fertilizers and food products. Initiatives like 
"Ethiopia Tamrit" can be instrumental in achieving self-sufficiency in essential goods. 
In addition, diversifying import sources need to be considered by exploring alternative suppliers 
beyond China to mitigate risks associated with dependence on a single source. In this regard, 
strengthening regional trade partnerships with African nations to leverage geographic proximity 
and economic integration is critical. What is more, investing in strategic industries should be given 
emphasis. This may focus on developing domestic industries capable of producing currently 
imported goods, such as agricultural goods, inputs, and processed basic consumer goods. This can 
enhance import substitution, create jobs, and boost the domestic economy. 
To improve trade balance and strengthen its economy, Ethiopia should prioritize strategies such 
as diversifying its export base, enhancing product quality, streamlining trade procedures, and 
exploring new markets to boost exports. Additionally, promoting domestic production of essential 
goods and basic consumption items, scaling up initiatives like "Ethiopia Tamrit," and investing in 
domestic industries can reduce import dependency. In this way, Ethiopia can improve its trade 
balance, mitigate external shocks, and foster sustainable economic growth.
