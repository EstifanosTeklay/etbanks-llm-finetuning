MESSAGE 
OF THE BOARD CHAIRPERSON 
Honorable Shareholders, 
On behalf of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Abyssinia S.C. and myself, I am honored to 
present the Board of Directors’ Report along with the “Audited Financial Statements” of the 
Bank to the 25th Ordinary Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of the Bank for the Fiscal 
Year 2020/21 that ended June 30, 2021.  
During FY 2020/21 the global and domestic economic and political environment remained 
challenging. The global economy has been experiencing recovery from the contraction in the 
previous year owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but with an uneven pattern (IMF 
WEO update, July 2021). That is, while advanced economies are recovering, many of the 
world’s low income countries are being left behind, mainly due to limitations in vaccine rollout 
distribution and deployment as well as increases in debt levels. Additionally, as a pandemic-
related development, the world economy faced an increased inflation due to demand-supply 
mismatches. Such divergent recoveries are expected to continue, whereby the global economy 
is expected to grow by 6.0% in 2021 and 4.9% in 2022 (IMF’s WEO update, July 2021).   
10 | Annual Report 2020/21
The Ethiopian economy has also passed through challenging environment owing to the effects 
of the pandemic and continued security concerns. Indeed, the year was one in which the 
economy went through a number of socio-economic and security challenges such as persistent 
foreign exchange shortages, high inflation, locust invasion and internal conflicts on top of 
negative effects of the pandemic

The Bank also continued expanding digital banking services by compounding more value-added 
services in card banking and online banking, which include issuance of domestic visa cards, as 
well as International Travel Debit and Prepaid Cards.  
It was during the reported year that the Bank’s new Board of Directors took over from the 
outgoing Board of Directors in a smooth and well-managed transition. Under the leadership of 
the departing Board of Directors, the Bank has achieved commendable growth in respect of the 
various performance indicators which is to be invigorated in the years to come. The Board, 
along with its three sub-committees, has been executing its oversight and guidance roles with 
full commitment and dedication thereby ensuring the Bank’s operations to run prudently and in 
compliance with regulatory requirements, policies and procedures.    
Honorable Shareholders,  
The Bank operates in an ever changing business environment characterized by varying 
customer expectations, evolving financial technologies, as well as economic and political 
dynamics which it keeps track of and manages accordingly. The Bank endeavors to overcome 
foreseeable challenges, explores opportunities and mitigates business risks so as to heighten its 
strong growth and profitability. 
In its second year of the Strategy Implementation, Bank of Abyssinia has managed to move 
forwards at higher growth trajectory across all performance indicators, while at the same time 
laying a strong foundation for growth and striving for the realization of its Corporate Vision.  
In order to take timely and appropriate measures, the Board of Directors stays actively engaged 
to thoroughly review the environmental dynamics as against the Bank’s overall direction and 
long-term plans. I am confident that, having the support of all stakeholders by our side, we will 
achieve the Bank’s strategic objectives in the years ahead and realize its mission to the 
satisfaction of all stakeholders in addition to playing an important role in the financial inclusion 
agenda of the nation. 
Finally, on behalf of the Board of Directors and myself, I would like to express my sincere 
gratitude to our esteemed customers for their confidence and trust in continuing working with 
our Bank. My appreciation also goes to our strategic partners for their co-operation and 
our Bank. My appreciation also goes to our strategic partners for their co-operation and 
our Bank. My appreciation also goes to our strategic partners f
harmonious work with BoA during the year.  
I would also like to send my gratitude to our shareholders for their support, to fellow members 
of the Board of Directors, the Bank’s Executive Management and the entire employees of the 
Bank of Abyssinia for their dedication and commitment, and to the National Bank of Ethiopia for 
its guidance and support.

MESSAGE OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
Esteemed Shareholders,

a remarkable performance in all 
a remarkable performance in all financial and non-financial objectives was registered. During 
the reported year, a number of challenges surfaced with phenomenal implications, ranging from 
the effects of the global pandemic to numerous socio-political developments. Nevertheless, the 
Bank has performed well throughout, indicating that its strategy is being implemented on a 
grounded and strong footing to warrant even higher results ahead. 
The FY 2020/21, a challenging year it was, has been characterized by a paradoxical co-
existence of volatile pandemic and a rebounding global growth as a result partly of vaccine-
powered normalization. This was 
powered normalization. This was reflected by the IMF (WEO April 2021 Report) which was also

The domestic economy, while impacted by the pandemic, has survived the pandemic to register 
a positive GDP growth (Ministry of Finance, June 2021), despite the ongoing security and socio-
economic challenges. This situation was compounded by rising general price levels, severe forex 
shortages and subdued business activities still unrecovered from the pandemic.  
The lack of security in the northern and few other parts of the country forced banks to suspend 
their operations in the affected areas. The situation was encountered with some positive 
measures taken by the NBE through demonetization of the old currency note, and subsequent 
directives, in relation to cash withdrawal limits and other policy amendments that encouraged 
business transactions into the formal channels and the use of non-cash basis for transactions. 
As to BoA’s part, relentless efforts were made in deploying and decisively implementing the 
Bank’s business strategies leveraged by the policy induced growth opportunity, which paid off 
and brought in such a performance that an incremental deposit growth of Birr 41.25 billion was 
achieved, and the total deposit reached Birr 88.88 billion. Equally commendable was its 
achievement in forex mobilization, which stood at USD 753.16 million, which was higher by 
88% than that of the preceding year. The total outstanding loans and advances reached Birr 
76.6 billion, twice that of the preceding year. Total asset and capital reached Birr 103.85 billion 
and 8.65 billion, increasing by 83% and 52%, respectively. The paid up capital of the Bank has 
also reached Birr 5.18 billion as at June 30, 2021. 
In the FY 2020/21, the Bank’s profitability has also continued to increase wherein gross profit 
(before tax) reached Birr 2.05 billion from last year’s level of Birr 1.08 billion, which in effect is 
higher by Birr 970 million (90% increase).  
The Bank’s accessibility also expanded through strategically located branch outlets as well as 
digital means. Accordingly, 97 additional branches and 9 sub-branches were opened in 2020/21 
FY, raising the total number of branches to 608. The Bank has deployed 740 ATMs in 2020/21 
increasing its ATM network to 969, which has led to a strong and sustained use of non-branch 
channels to access banking services. With an effort made to reach more customers, the Bank 
has also increased its deposit customer base by more than 2.55 million additional customers, 
which brought the total customer number to 5.16 million; of which Interest Free Banking 
accounts comprised 0.62 million. 
In line with its strategic direction, the Bank has continued to perform exceptionally well on 
digitalization and kept introducing to the market new and breakthrough digital banking services.

During the year under review, the Bank had launched new products and value added services 
pioneering the digital banking arena. These include virtual banking service in four selected 
locations in Addis, which is gaining momentum and popularity. The Bank is now working on 
expanding virtual banking services in 15 locations in Addis Ababa and major regional cities. The 
payment gateway for e-commerce service is another new development which was successfully 
launched in the current year.

The Bank has continued its efforts to render excellent services in digital banking and introduced

its digital platform of payment gateway and introduced various products including a mobile app

branch expansion and business development that resulted in administrative and depreciation 
expenses.

3. Strategic Issues 
3.1 Human Resources
The Bank pays due attention to one of its major assets, human capital, as being an important 
determinant in organizational effectiveness. As laid out in its mission statement, the Bank 
recognizes that deploying competent and motivated human capital is key to deliver on its 
aspiration of “maximizing value to all stakeholders”. In this connection, BoA has implemented a 
coherent HR strategy that would enable the Bank to attract talent, develop and retain 
employees for an enhanced productivity and overall business efficiency. This is particularly 
important where the banking industry expects new entrants to join the market in large numbers 
who would compete for the limited talent available in key positions. The Bank’s implementation 
of integrated human resource programs is playing a pivotal role in this regard, in areas of 
performance management system, talent management, talent development, and succession 
and career management.   
A number of activities have been conducted during the Fiscal Year in talent management and 
talent development wherein the Bank continued to strengthen its human resource both in terms 
of number and competencies. Accordingly, the number of employees has increased to 8,146 at 
the end of the Fiscal Year, an increase by 21.3% from last year same period human resource 
strength. With a view to provide enhanced and efficient services to customers, successive 
developmental and technical trainings were conducted on top of facilitating support for short- 
and long-term formal education. 
3.2 Expansion of Branches  
Expansion of service accessibility through increased branch network has continued in the Fiscal 
Year and the Bank has opened 97 new branches and bringing the total number of branches to 
608. Additionally, numerous sub-branches and branch outlets are opened to accommodate 
outlying customers, reinforcing the Bank’s leading stance among private banks in respect of 
number of branch outlets.

Definition of a Business – Amendments to IFRS 3  
The amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations clarifies that to be considered a business, an 
integrated set of activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive 
process that, together, significantly contribute to the ability to create output. Furthermore, it 
clarifies that a business can exist without including all of the inputs and processes needed to 
create outputs. These amendments had no impact on BoA financial statements.

The amendments to IFRS 9 and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement 
provide a number of reliefs, which apply to all hedging relationships that are directly affected by

Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting  
In March 2018 the IASB published a revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting, 
 a revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting, 
 a revised Conceptual Framework
often referred to as the “Conceptual Framework”, applicable to IFRS preparers for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020. The Conceptual Framework provides guidance to 
preparers on determining accounting policies where no specific IFRS or IAS Standard applies to 
a particular transaction or where a Standard allows for an accounting policy choice.It includes 
limited revisions of definitions of an asset and a liability, as well as new guidance on 
measurement and de-recognition, presentation and disclosure. The concept of prudence has 
been reintroduced with the statement that prudence supports neutrality. The Conceptual 
Framework does not replace any specific Standard. The changes in the Conceptual Framework 
are not considered material to BoA financial statements, since significant accounting policies are 
derived from specific IFRS or IAS standards.

Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the Bank operates (“the functional currency”). The functional 
currency and presentation currency of the Bank is the Ethiopian Birr (Birr). 
b)
Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into “Birr”using the exchange rates prevailing at the 
dates of the transactions. Monetary items denominated in foreign currency are translated using 
the closing rate as at the reporting date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the 
settlement of such transactions, and from the translation of year-end exchange rates of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognized in the income statement.  
At the end of a reporting period non-monetary items carried at historical amounts continue to be 
measured using transaction-date exchange rates, monetary items are retranslated using the 
closing rate and non-monetary items carried at fair value are measured at valuation-date 
exchange rates.

For debt instruments at fair value through OCI, interest income, foreign exchange revaluation and 
impairment losses or reversals are recognized in profit or loss and computed in the same manner 
as for financial assets measured at a mortised cost. The remaining fair value changes are 
recognized in OCI. Upon de-recognition, the cumulative fair value change recognized in OCI is 
recycled to profit or loss. 
iii)  Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI (equity instruments)

determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. 
Gains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are 
recognized as other income in profit or loss when the right of payment has been established, 
except when the Bank benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the 
financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments designated at 
fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment assessment. 
The Bank elected to classify irrevocably its non-listed equity investments under this category 
as it intends to hold these investments for the foreseeable future.

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading, 
financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, or financial 
assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value. Financial assets are classified as held 
for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. 
Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified as held for trading 
unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial assets with cash flows that 
are not solely payments of principal and interest are classified and measured at fair value through 
profit or loss, irrespective of the business model.

ii)
Loans and borrowings  
This is the category most relevant to the Bank. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings are subsequently measured at a mortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and 
losses are recognized in profit or loss when the liabilities are de-recognized as well as through the 
EIR amortization process.  
A mortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and 
fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included as finance 
costs in profit or loss.

the expected cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in


If the expected restructuring will result in de-recognition of the existing asset, then the 
expected fair value of the new asset is related as the final cash flow from the existing 
financial asset at the time of its de-recognition.  This amount is included in calculating the 
cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected 
date of de-recognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the

ii)
Amortization 
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.  Intangible 
assets with finite lives are amortized over the useful economic life.  The amortization period and 
the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at 
each financial year-end.  Changes in the expected useful life, or the expected pattern of 
consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset, are accounted for by changing 
the amortization period or methodology, as appropriate, which are then treated as changes in 
accounting estimates.  The amortization expenses on intangible assets with finite lives is 
presented as separate line item in the income statement.  
Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method to write down the cost of intangible 
assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives. Except for undisclosed useful life 
in the contract the Bank has used 6 years useful life for all intangible assets the rest will use as 
per contract, the residual rate will be zero percent for all intangible asset. 
2.8 Investment property 
Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, are classified 
as investment properties. 
Recognition of investment properties takes place only when it is probable that the future 
economic benefits that are associated with the investment property will flow to the Bank and the 
cost can be reliably measured. This is usually when all risks are transferred. 
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs.  The Bank has 
opted to subsequently carry investment property at cost and disclose fair value.  Fair value is 
based on comparative market prices, adjusted if necessary, for any difference in the nature, 
location or condition of the specific asset.  If this information is not available, the Bank uses 
alternative valuation methods, such as recent prices on less active markets or discounted cash 
flow projections.  Valuations are performed as of the reporting date by professional values who 
hold recognized and relevant professional qualifications and have recent experience in location 
and category of the investment property being valued.  These valuations from the basis for the 
carrying amounts in the financial statements.  
The fair value of investment property reflects, the near current market conditions.  The fair value 
of investment property does not reflect future capital expenditure that will improve or enhance 
the property and does not reflect the related future benefits from this future expenditure other 
than those a rational market participant would take into account when determining the value of 
the property. 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized to the asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Bank and the cost of the 
item can be measured reliably.  All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when 
incurred.  When part of an investment property is replaced, the carrying amount of the replaced 
part is derecognized. 
Investment properties are derecognized when they have been disposed.  Where the Bank 
disposes of a property at fair value in an arm’s length transaction, the carrying value immediately 
prior to the sale is adjusted to the transaction price, and the adjustment is recorded in the 
statement of changes in net assets available for benefit.

2.11 Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Bank assesses, each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be 
impaired.  If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required.  
The Bank estimates the asset’s recoverable amount.  An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher 
of an asset’s or Cash-Generating Units (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.  
Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate 
cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.  When 
the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered 
impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.  In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset.  In 
determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account.  
If no such transactions can be identified, and appropriate valuation model is used.  These 
calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded 
companies or other available fair value indicators. 
The Bank bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which 
are prepared separately for each of the Bank’s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated.  
These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years.  For longer 
periods, a long term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the 
fifth year.  For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is an indication that previously recognized impairment losses no longer 
exist or have decreased.  If such indication exists, the Bank estimates the asset’s or CGU’s 
recoverable amount.  A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a 
change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last 
impairment loss was recognized.  The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset 
does not exceed its recoverable amount, not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior 
years.  Such reversal is recognized in the income statement. 
2.12 Other assets 
Other assets are generally defined as claims held against other entities for the future receipt of 
money.  The assets in the Bank’s financial statements include the following: 
(a) Prepayment 
Prepayments are payment made in advance for services to be enjoyed in future.  The amount is 
initially capitalized in the reporting period in which the payment is made and subsequently 
amortized over the period in which the service is to be enjoyed.

calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholder of the Bank by 
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. 
2.19 Income taxation  
(a) Current Income tax 
The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable 
income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in 
deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses. 
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the end of the reporting period in Ethiopia.  Management periodically evaluates 
positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is 
subject to interpretation.  It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts 
expected to be paid to the tax authorities. 
(b) Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.  However, deferred tax liabilities 
are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred tax is not 
accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than

nor loss. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset 
is realized or the deferred tax liability is settled. 
Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit 
will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities 
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or 
different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

The carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability is adjusted if the Bank revises its 
estimates of payments or receipts.  The adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the 
original EIR and the change in carrying amount is recorded as ‘Interest and similar income’ for 
financial assets and interest and similar expenses for financial liabilities.  
Once the recorded value of a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been 
reduced due to an impairment loss, interest income continues to be recognized using the rate of 
interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.

a)
Effective interest rate and amortized cost 
Interest income and expense are recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest method.  
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or 
receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to: 

The gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or  

The amortized cost of the financial liability. 
When calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments other than credit impaired 
assets, the Bank estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial 
instrument, but not expected credit losses.  For credit-impaired financial assets, a credit-adjusted 
effective interest rate is calculated using estimated future cash flows including expected credit 
losses. 
The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees and payments 
paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.  Transaction costs include 
incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or 
financial liability.

3.5 Impairment of non-financial assets 
Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its 
recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.  
The fair value less costs of disposal calculation is based on available data from binding sales 
transactions, conducted at arm’s length, for similar assets or observable market prices less 
incremental costs for disposing of the asset.  The value in use calculation is based on a DCF 
model.   
The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years and do not include 
restructuring activities that the Bank is not yet committed to or significant future investments that 
will enhance the asset’s performance of the CGU being tested.  The recoverable amount is 
sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected 
future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purpose. 
3.6 Taxes 
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax 
laws, and the amount and timing of future taxable income.  Given the wide range of international 
business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual 
agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future 
changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense 
already recorded.  The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience 
of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the 
responsible tax authority. 
Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses to the extent that this is probable that 
taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilized.  Significant management 
judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, 
based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax 
planning strategies. 
3.7 Development cost 
The Bank capitalizes development costs for a project in accordance with the accounting policy. 
Initial capitalization of costs is based on Management’s judgment that technological and economic 
feasibility is confirmed, usually when a product development project has reached a defined 
milestone according to established project management model.  
In determining the amounts to be capitalized, management makes assumptions regarding the 
expected future cash generation of the project, discount rates to be applied and the expected 
period of benefits.   
The development costs that were capitalized by the Bank relates to those arising from the 
development of computer software.

4.1.2 Risk measurement and reporting systems 
The Bank’s risks are measured using a method that reflect both the expected loss likely to arise in 
normal circumstances and unexpected losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss 
based on scenario analysis. The analysis make used probabilities derived from historical 
experience, adjusted to reflect the economic environment. The Bank also runs worst-case 
scenarios that would arise in the event that extreme events which are unlikely to occur do, in fact 
occur. 
Monitoring and controlling risk is primarily performed based on limits established by the Bank. 
These limits reflect the business strategy and market environment of the Bank as well as the level 
of the risk that the Bank is willing to accept, with additional emphasis on selected regions. In 
addition, the Bank’s policy is to measure and monitor the overall risk bearing capacity in relation 
to the aggregated risk exposure across all risk types and activities.

BANK OF ABYSSINIA  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2021

The objective of assessment is to identify whether significant increase in credit risk has occurred 
for an exposure by comparing:  

The remaining lifetime probability of default (PD) as at the reporting date; with 

The remaining lifetime PD for this point in time that was estimated at the time of initial 
recognition of the exposure (adjusted when relevant for changes in prepayment 
expectation). 

The Bank uses three criteria for determining whether there has been a significant increase 
in credit risk: 

Quantitative test based on movement in PD; 

Qualitative indicators; and 

A backstop of days past due. 
iii) Credit risk grades 
The Bank allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on a variety of data that is 
determined to be predictive of the risk of default and applying experienced credit judgment. 
Credit risk grades are defined using qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of risk 
of default. These factors vary depending on the nature of the exposure and the type of borrower. 
Credit risk grades are defined and calibrated such that the risk of default occurring increases 
exponentially as the credit risk deteriorates so, for example, the difference in risk of default 
between credit risk grade 1 and 2 is smaller than the difference between credit risk grade 2 and 
3. Each exposure is allocated to a credit risk grade on initial recognition based on available 
information about the borrower. Exposures are subject to ongoing monitoring, which may result 
in an exposure being moved to a different credit risk grade. The monitoring typically involves use 
of the following data: 
a. Term loan exposure 

Information obtained during periodic review of customer file –e.g. Audited financial 
statements, management accounts, budgets and projections. Examples of areas of 
particular focus are: gross profit margins, financial leverage ratio, debt service 
coverage, compliance with the Banks policies and procedures. 

Data from credit reference agencies, press articles, changes in external credit ratings  

Actual and expected significant changes in the political, regulatory and technological 
environment of the borrower or in its business activities  

Internally collected data on customer behavior –e.g. utilization of credit card facilities 
affordability metrics of borrower’s financial and non-financial information.


Payment record-this includes overdue status as well as a range of variables about 
payment ratio. 

Utilization of the granted limit.



As a backstop, the Bank considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs not later than

when an asset is more than 30 days past due.  Days past due are determined by counting the 
number of days since the earliest elapsed due date in respect of which full payment has not been 
received. Due dates are determined without considering any grace period that might be available 
to the borrower.

When contractual term of a loan have been modified, evidence that the criteria for recognizing 
lifetime ECL are no longer  met includes a history of up-to-date payment performance against the 
modified contractual terms. 
The Bank monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify significant increase in credit 
risk by regular reviews to confirm that: 

The criteria are capable of identifying significant increases in credit risk before an 
exposure is in default; 

The criteria does not align with the point in time when an asset becomes 30 days 
past due; 

The average time between the identification of a significant increase in credit risk 
and default appears reasonable;-exposure are not generally transferred directly 
from 12-month ECL measurement to credit –impaired; and 

There is no unwarranted volatility in loss allowance from transfers between 12-
month PD (stage 1) and lifetime PD (stage 2). 
VI) Definition of default 
The Bank considers a financial asset to be in default when: 

The borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank in full, without recourse 
by the Bank to actions such as realizing security (if any is held);  

The borrower is more than 90 days past due on any material credit obligation to the 
Bank; 

Overdrafts are considered as being past due once the customer has breached an advised 
limit or been advised of a limit smaller than the current amount outstanding; or 

It is becoming probable that the Borrower will restructure the asset as result of 
bankruptcy due to the borrower’s inability to pay its credit obligations.  
In assessing whether the borrower is in default, the Bank considers indicators that are: 

Qualitative: e.g. breaches of covenant; 

Quantitative: e.g. overdue statues and non-payment on another obligation of  some issuer 
to the Bank; and 

Based on data developed internally and obtained from external sources.  

Inputs to the assessment of weather a financial instrument is in default and their 
significance may vary over time to reflect changes in circumstances. 
The definition of default largely aligns with that applied by the Bank for regulatory capital 
purposes 
vii)
Incorporation of forward-looking information 
The Bank incorporates forward-looking information in to both the assessment of whether the

Measurement of ECL   
The key inputs in to the measurement of ECL are the term structure of the following variables: 

Probability of default (PD); 

Loss given default (LGD); and  

Exposure at default  
ECL for exposure in stage 1 is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD by LGD and EAD. 
Lifetime ECL is calculated by multiplying the lifetime PD by LGD and EAD. 
The methodology of estimating PDs is discussed above under the heading `Generating the term 
structure of PD’. 
LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is default. The Bank estimate LGD parameters 
based on the history of recovery rates of claims against defaulted counterparties. The LGD 
models consider the structure, collateral, seniority of the claim, counterparty industry and 
recovery cost of any collateral that is integral to the financial asset. 
EAD represents the expected exposure in the events of a default. The Bank derives the EAD from 
the current exposure to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed 
under the contract and arising from amortization. The EAD of a financial asset is its gross carrying 
amount at the time of default. For lending commitments, the EADs are potential future amounts 
of the guaranteed exposure when the financial guarantee becomes payable. For financial assets, 
EAD is determining by modeling the range of possible exposure outcomes at various points in 
time using scenario and statistical techniques.  
As described above, and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for stage 1 financial 
assets, the Bank measures ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual 
period (including any borrower’s extension options) over which it is exposed to credit risk, even if, 
for credit risk management purpose, the Bank considers a longer period. 
The maximum contractual period extends to the date at which the Bank has the right to require 
repayment of an advance or terminate a loan commitment component, or guarantee. 
However, for overdraft that include both a loan and undrawn commitment component, the Bank 
measures ECL over a period longer than the maximum contractual period if the Bank’s contractual 
ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the Bank’s 
exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period. These facilitates do not have a fixed 
term or repayment structure and are managed on a collective basis. The Bank can cancel them 
with immediate effect but this contractual right is not enforced in the normal day-to-day 
management, but only when the Bank becomes aware of an increase in credit risk at the facility 
level. This longer period is estimated taking in to account the credit risk management actions that 
the Bank expects to take, and that serve to mitigate ECL. These include a reduction in limits, 
cancellation of the facility and/or turning the outstanding balance in to a loan with fixed 
repayment terms.

a) Collateral held and their financial effect  
The general creditworthiness of a customer tends to be the most relevant indicators of credit 
quality of a loan extended to him/her/it. However, collateral provides additional security and the 
Bank generally requests that corporate borrowers provide it. Staff loans are secured to the extent 
of the employee’s continued employment in the Bank. 
The Bank may take collateral in the form of a first charge over real estate, loans and guarantees. 
The Bank may take collateral in the form of a first charge over real estate, loans and guarantees. 
The Bank may take collateral in the form of a first charge over
The Bank does not sell or re-pledge the collateral in the absence of default by the owner of the 
collateral. In addition to the Bank’s focus on creditworthiness, the Bank aligns with its credit 
policy guide to periodically update the validation of collaterals held against all loans to customers. 
For impaired loans, the Bank obtains appraisal of collateral because the fair value of the collateral 
is an input to the impairment measurement.

The fair value of collaterals are based on the last revaluations carried out by the Bank’s in-house 
engineers. The valuation technique adopted for properties is in line with the Bank’s valuation 
manual and the revalued amount is similar to the fair value of the properties with similar size and

Market risk  
 
 
Market risk is defined as the risk of loss  that the fair value or future cash flows a financial 
instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market risk factors such as interest rates, foreign 
exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads and their volatilities. Market risk can arise in 
conjunction with trading and non-trading activities of a financial institution. 
The Bank does not ordinarily engage in trading activities as there are no active markets in 
Ethiopia. 
4.5.1 Management of market risk  
The main objective of Market Risk Management is to manage and control market risk                
ontrol market risk                
exposures within acceptable parameters, there by optimizing the return on risk.  
Market risk is monitored by the Risk Management Department regularly, to identify any adverse 
movement in the underlining variables 
(i) Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that value of a financial instrument will be affected by changes in 
market interest rates. Borrowings obtained at variable rates give rise to interest rate risk. 
The Bank’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Bank’s 
obligations and financial assets with floating interest rates. The Bank also exposed on fixed rate 
financial assets and financial liabilities. The Bank’s investment portfolio is comprised of treasury 
bills, loans and receivables and cash deposits.

The Bank is exposed to exchange rate risk to the extent of assets and liabilities (balance)

foreign denominated asset and foreign denominated liabilities and the direction of foreign 
exchange rate will determine the level of the Bank’s foreign exchange risk exposure. Management

4.7 Fair value of financial asset and liabilities  
IFRS 13 requires an entity to classify measured or disclosed fair values according to a hierarchy 
that reflects the significance of observable inputs. 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements 
are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, which comprises of three levels as described 
below, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a 
whole. 
4.7.1 Valuation models  
IFRS 13 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those 
valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data 
obtained from independent sources; unobservable inputs reflect the Bank’s market assumptions. 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements 
are categorized with in the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level 
that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole. 

Level 1: inputs that quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical asset or 
liabilities. 

Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly (i.e.as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This 
category includes instruments valued using : quoted market price in active markets for 
similar instruments; quoted price for identical or similar instruments in market that are 
considered less than active, or other valuation technique in which all significant inputs are 
directly or indirectly observable from market data.  
BANK OF ABYSSINIA

In conclusion, this category is for valuation techniques for which the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable. 

Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data 
(unobservable input). This category includes all assets and liabilities for which the

table published by the institution of Actuaries of England. These rates combined are 
approximately summarized as follows:

iii) Withdrawals from Service 
The withdrawal rates are believed to be reasonable representative of the Ethiopian experience. 
The valuation assumed a rate of withdrawals of 10% at youngest age falling with increasing age 
to 2.5% at age 44. 
The sensitivity of the overall defined benefit liability to changes in the weighted principal 
assumption is:

The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other 
assumptions constant in practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the 
assumptions may be correlated.  
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial 
assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the 
projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when 
calculating the pension liability recognized within the statement of financial position. 
There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis 
from prior years. The average duration of the severance pay plan at the end of the reporting 
period is 2.78 year.

National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) guidelines is higher than the loan loss impairment determined 
using the expected credit model.  
Where the loan loss impairment determined using the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) guidelines 
is higher than the loan loss impairment determined using the incurred loss model under IFRS, the 
difference is transferred to regulatory risk reserve and it is non-distributable to the owners of the 
Bank. 
Where the loan loss impairment determined using the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) guidelines 
is less than the loan loss impairment determined using the incurred loss model under IFRS, the
