This note reviews the sources, frequency, and timing of 
macroeconomic data releases in Ethiopia. We also compare Ethiopia’s 
record of macro data releases with that of other countries. As access 
to timely macro data will become increasingly important in the coming 
years—given rising private sector participation in the economy, on-
going foreign investment activity, and prospective capital markets—
we point to several areas for improvement that could be realized with 
modest changes to the data release timetables of just a few 
institutions. 
 
Macroeconomic data in Ethiopia is provided by five key institutions, 
namely the: (1) Central Statistical Authority (CSA); (2) National Planning 
Commission (NPC); (3) Ministry of Finance and Economic Cooperation 
(MOFEC); (4) National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE); and (5) Ministry of 
Revenues. A listing of the key macroeconomic data series provided by 
these institutions is presented below under four main categories—real 
sector, fiscal sector, monetary sector, and external sector (see Table 1). 
    
Real sector data in Ethiopia tend to be focused mainly on GDP and price 
statistics. GDP data are released by the National Planning Commission 
only once-a-year and with a roughly five- to six-month lag, thus coming 
out in November or December for the fiscal year ending in June. Among 
GDP components, the agriculture sector’s performance can be inferred 
somewhat earlier from the CSA’s “Agricultural Sample Survey” 
publication that provides volume estimates for all major food crops and 
is generally released in the final quarter of the relevant fiscal year (e.g., 
estimates for the FY 2018-19 harvest came out in June 2019).1 Other 
sector-specific data (say for mining, construction, or services) are 
generally not available at a standard frequency or are released in an ad 
hoc manner; the manufacturing sector is an exception, given that a 
“Large and Medium Scale Manufacturing Survey” is compiled annually 
(covering more than 3,500 firms) but this comes out with a lag of more 
than two years.2 Data on nominal spending levels separate from GDP 
                                                        
1 Besides CSA data, agriculture production figures for selected crops are available from 
supplementary sources such as the WFP, IFPRI, and USDA. 
2The latest available Manufacturing Survey is for FY 2016-17 data.

statistics (e.g. retail sales) are not readily available, while household 
income and consumption expenditure surveys are generally available at 
one-off intervals and with a 3-4 year lag.3 Employment levels,  
unemployment rates, and labour participation rates are other indicators 
that could reveal trends real economic activity but these are  generally 
not available at a regular frequency. For investment data, these are 
contained in GDP statistics (thus involving a five- to six-month lag), but 
some partial indications of investment activity are available via press 
releases from regional investment bureaus or from the Ethiopian 
Investment Commission (for FDI). Finally, for price and inflation data, 
these are available within five days of the end of the month (or at times 
even within 2-3 days of end-of-month) and are generally immediately 
posted on the CSA’s website and released directly to the press.   
 
Fiscal sector data made publicly available in Ethiopia include: (1) the 
government budget, which is normally released every June for the fiscal 
year starting in July; (2) quarterly revenue data provided by the Ministry 
of Revenue via press releases; (3) quarterly overall budget estimates 
(provided in the Quarterly Bulletin of the NBE and covering revenue, 
expenditure and overall balance/deficit positions), and; (4) quarterly 
debt figures made available in MOFEC’s Quarterly Debt Bulletin. 
Revenue data have, in the past, sometimes been released by the 
Ministry of Revenue on a monthly basis, but this has been on an ad hoc 
basis. The provision of debt data has become much more transparent in 
recent years and now includes quarterly figures on: total outstanding 
public debt by borrower and by lender (both foreign and domestic); new 
foreign loans contracted; new foreign loans disbursed; foreign loan 
repayments effected; and domestic debt borrowings plus outstanding 
debt balances owed to the central bank, the commercial banks, and the 
non-bank public (such as pension funds).    
 
Monetary sector data are provided by the NBE and include figures on 
broad money (total deposits plus currency held by the public), reserve 
money, and foreign asset positions of both the NBE and commercial 
banks. These data are all made available in the NBE’s Quarterly Bulletin, 
which generally comes out four or five months after the end of a given 
quarter (the latest available Quarterly Bulletin for end-March 2019 data 
came out with a nearly four-month lag in mid-July 2019). The Quarterly 
Bulletin also provides quarterly statistics on other financial sector 
                                                        
3 The last Household Consumption Expenditure Survey was completed in the 2015-
16 fiscal year and became available in January 2018.

metrics, including bank deposit/lending rates, T-Bill rates, corporate 
bond issuances, banks’ capital and branch data, micro-finance 
institutions data, and insurance sector data. Looking beyond the NBE, 
data on banking trends is available from private banks, who have an 
established norm of conducting surveys amongst themselves—generally 
undertaken by their Marketing or Research units—which cover their 
end-quarter financial positions for variables such as deposits, loans, NBE 
Bill holdings, assets, capital, profits, branches, and employment. 
 
External Sector: The full set of balance of payments statistics—covering 
all foreign exchange inflows and outflows—is released on a quarterly 
basis as part of NBE’s Quarterly Bulletin, and is thus generally available 
with a four- to five-month lag. The NBE’s BOP tables provide figures on 
exports, imports, service sector inflows/outflows, interest payments, 
dividend payments, remittances, grants, loans, FDI, and other capital 
flows. The BOP data also provide a key indicator of the country’s external 
position, namely the central bank’s gross foreign exchange reserves 
position. Some components of the balance of payments are available 
earlier from relevant bodies: for example, the Ministry of Trade and 
Industry generally releases export and import figures one or two months 
after the end of the relevant month and often within two months of the 
end of the fiscal year for the full-year outturns; FDI data may be released 
within two or three months of the end fiscal year by the EIC; and external 
grants and loans data may also be released separately by MOFEC press 
releases within a few months of the end of the fiscal year. With respect 
to data on exchange rates, these are available daily from most 
commercial bank websites, with the most up-to-date figures (based on 
our experience) provided by the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia—which 
provides the daily Birr/USD exchange rate every morning at around 8AM 
as well as cross-rates for 19 other currencies (besides the USD) plus 
historical exchange rate data going back many years. 
 
Ethiopia in a Cross-Country Context 
 
A comparison of macroeconomic data releases with other relevant 
countries shows considerable room for Ethiopia to improve the scope, 
timeliness, and frequency of its data releases. More specifically:  
 
o Scope of data releases: 
§ Ethiopia still lacks indices of economic activity based on high-
frequency and more readily available/collectable indicators 
(see discussion below).

§ No surveys of the ‘business confidence’ or ‘business 
expectations’ are systematically collected—covering for 
example manufacturers, service providers, or other key sectors 
and potentially useful to provide trends in business sentiment 
and/or future expectations.   
§ On prices, the scope of releases seems generally adequate, but 
the price index does not provide measures of ‘core’ inflation 
(excluding certain volatile components). 
 
o Frequency of data releases: 
§ GDP is only available on an annual basis and could usefully be 
increased to a quarterly frequency (Table 2A), as is already the 
norm in most emerging markets. 
§ The frequency of data releases for key monetary variables—
such as deposits, broad money, reserve money, and foreign 
exchange reserves—still takes three to four months even 
though most of the underlying reporting (by commercial 
banks) takes place within 10 or 15 days after the end of the 
month.  
 
o Timing of data releases: 
§ GDP data are generally released five or six months after the 
end of the fiscal year, versus a norm of just three months in 
most peer countries (Table 2B).  
§ Based on our review of NBE Quarterly Bulletin releases over 
the past decade, we find that the average lag time for such data 
releases was 190 days or around six months, though this has 
improved steadily in recent years and is now down to 3½ 
months for 2019 (Table 3).  Following the norm of some peer 
countries would reduce the time lag to just two months or less. 
§ External sector data and foreign exchange reserves data, both 
generally available only in NBE’s Quarterly Bulletin, is also 
usually out with a four- to five-month lag, while the norm in 
most other countries is much shorter, especially for foreign 
exchange reserves data that—given its nature—can often be 
released within weeks of the end of the reporting period (Table 
2B).

Conclusions 
 
The above review of Ethiopia’s macro data releases suggests several 
areas for potential improvement. We think the most meaningful areas 
for improvement would include:  
 
o Construction of an index of high-frequency economic activity 
indicators: An index of various high-frequency indicators could 
provide a valuable ‘economic pulse’ of on-going activity without 
having to rely solely on once-a-year GDP data releases. Such an index 
could be compiled and regularly released by a public institution (such 
as the NBE or NPC) or perhaps as a collaboration between public and 
private institutions. Ranging from simple proxies of just a couple 
variables to more sophisticated indices involving numerous metrics, 
high-frequency economic activity indicators can track variables such 
as: production levels in specific industries, purchasing manager 
indices, retail sales, building permits/housing starts, cargo volumes, 
new vehicle registrations, unemployment rates, trade flows, tax 
collection trends, and credit developments (Table 4). In the Ethiopia 
context, some ‘flash estimates’ or ‘advance estimates’ could be 
considered in areas such as crop production (in the months 
immediately after the annual harvests), manufacturing activity 
(focused, say, on data from all industrial parks), or number of permits 
for new business formations or new residential/commercial building 
constructions (compiled from urban municipalities and/or sub-
cities).  Indices covering monthly data on EAL/shipping cargo 
volumes, vehicle registrations trade flows, tax collection and credit 
developments are also potentially possible with the collaboration of 
the relevant institutions.4 Both macro policymakers and the wider 
business/investment community would be important beneficiaries 
of such high frequency indices for the Ethiopian economy. 
    
o Publicizing quarterly budget data: Quarterly data releases on 
revenue and expenditure, including overall deficit and financing 
outturns, could usefully provide another signal of economic activity 
and of the progress of key policy measures in this area. Current data 
releases in this area cover quarterly revenue performance data, but 
do not generally include budget expenditure outturns or the 
                                                        
3 Cepheus Research attempts to track a small set of such indicators and we have 
included in our Macro Handbook and Quarterly Reviews observed trends for 
variables such as fuel consumption, electricity consumption, EAL cargo volume, 
vehicle registrations, Djibouti port traffic, tax collections, and banking data.

associated financing data (covering net borrowing from external 
sources and from the domestic banking system).  
 
o Regular release of export and import data: Formally releasing 
export and import data after say one month from the end of a given 
month can also provide another indicator of underlying economic 
trends and of foreign exchange developments. Such releases already 
take place in an ad hoc fashion (via occasional press releases or by 
sector-specific press releases from coffee or horticulture agencies) 
but a formalized and complete release of export/import data would 
provide the public with a more complete picture of latest trends.  
 
o Faster release of quarterly monetary and fx reserves data: Perhaps 
most important, timely release of monetary and foreign exchange 
reserves data could provide confidence to the private sector and 
foreign investors of the central bank’s policy efforts to control 
inflation and manage foreign exchange reserves. There is often a 
high level of misinformation in this area, and making available more 
data at a greater frequency will work to minimize misperceptions 
that can negatively and unduly affect public sentiment.  
 
o A calendar of future macro data releases: As is common in most 
emerging and frontier markets, putting out a planned calendar of 
data releases can provide a positive signal to investors by providing 
an assurance on the availability of timely macro data. Such a 
calendar can also serve as a disciplining device for relevant 
institutions to release key data points as scheduled, and will also 
become indispensable if and when Ethiopia moves towards the 
establishment of capital markets.  Based on our observations of 
recent data release patterns, we put together such an illustrative 
calendar of upcoming macro data releases for the period up to the 
end of this fiscal year (Table 5).  
 
In summary, the potential improvements suggested above would—
in our view—provide tangible economic benefits in: (1) minimizing 
often misleading macro data points that are out in the public domain, 
and (in its place) (2) deepening the macro information base—for 
planning and decision making purposes—available to Ethiopia’s 
growing private sector, foreign investors, and participants in its 
prospective capital markets.
