We review the recently approved Government Budget for the 2022-23 fiscal year 
and summarize below some of its most notable elements.   
 
1. Headline Numbers: The Ethiopian Parliament approved yesterday a government 
budget with planned expenditure of Birr 787bn (11% of GDP) for the new 2022-23 
fiscal year, to be funded by Birr 439bn of revenue collections, Birr 39bn of grants, 
Birr 43bn of foreign borrowing, and Birr 266bn of domestic borrowing.  
 
2. New Taxes: Budget measures being initiated include a widening of the VAT/excise 
tax base, new fuel excises, a new property tax, and some tax administration efforts. 
 
3. Revenue is forecast to grow by 37% (14% in real terms), with the largest collections 
coming from income taxes (Birr 125bn, 28% of total), VAT on imports (Birr 64bn, 
15%), customs duties (Birr 62bn, 14%), and VAT on services (Birr 45bn, 10%). 
 
4. Expenditure is rising by 22% vs last year’s outturns, with large increases planned 
for  transfers/subsidies (up 9.6x), defence (up 3.8x), and debt service (up 2.8x). 
 
5. Wages are set to rise to Birr 76bn or by 46% (due to new hires plus higher salaries), 
but will be equivalent to 1% of GDP and thus still at the low end of global norms. 
 
6. Capital expenditure by government will drop to just 3% of GDP, the lowest in a 
decade, and implying higher state enterprise and private sector capital outlays will 
be needed if investment-to-GDP ratios are to stay at current levels (28% of GDP).  
 
7. Spending Quality: While poverty-reducing spending is near 60% of the overall 
budget, the sharply increased allocation for defence and debt service dues (at the 
expense of social spending and growth-promoting capital expenditure) points to 
a deterioration in expenditure quality. Whether this is a trend break from long-
standing norms or a one-off exception remains to be seen in the coming years. 
 
8. External financing: Only $706mn of foreign budget grants and $776mn of foreign 
budget loans are expected, roughly 81% and 53% of their past five-year averages. 
 
9. Domestic financing: Besides the Birr 266bn in planned domestic borrowing, 
Government will need to rollover a large volume of T-Bills falling due this year  
(Birr 23bn per month, Birr 279bn in total). With such high demands on local debt 
markets, T-Bill rates will likely trend higher towards 10% or the low teens this year. 
 
10. 
Domestic Debt: Due to Government’s heavy reliance on local borrowing, more than 
half of public debt is now owed to domestic lenders for the first time in years; this 
shift is reducing credit growth to the private sector, but improving medium-term 
prospects for foreign funding should minimize such adverse impacts going forward.

Overview: Budget Assumptions and Headline Numbers  
 
• 
Macro Framework: The main macroeconomic assumptions underlying this year’s Government budget 
include real GDP growth of 9.2%, year-average inflation of 11.9%, nominal GDP growth (implied) of 
22.2%, and import growth (important for trade-related taxes) of 10%.  
 
• 
The key headline numbers for the budget show: (1) Revenue and Grants of Birr 478bn; (2) Expenditure 
of Birr 787bn; and (3) a resultant deficit of Birr 309bn. The budget deficit is to be covered by Birr 43bn 
($776mn) of external borrowing and Birr 266bn of domestic borrowing.

Budgetary Figures Relative to GDP: 
 
• 
Seen relative to GDP, the budget’s revenue and grants target is equivalent to 6.4 percent of GDP, 
expenditure stands at 10.5 percent of GDP, and the resulting deficit amounts to 4.1 percent of GDP.  
Despite increases in the Birr value of revenue collections, the decline in the revenue-to-GDP to near 
6 percent is particularly notable and suggests either that still-large segments of the economy remain 
outside the tax net and/or that there is a possible over-estimation of the nominal GDP denominator. 
 
• 
The above ratios are based on a nominal GDP figure—reflecting budget assumptions—that is 
projected to reach Birr 7.46 trillion in the just starting fiscal year, up from what is expected to be a 
GDP figure of Birr 6.1 trillion for the just ended 2021-22 fiscal year.  
 
• 
Regarding GDP figures, we now estimate nominal GDP for FY 2021-22 will be near Birr 6,109bn, 
reflecting expectations that Government will report GDP growth of 6.6 percent for the just-ended 
fiscal year and also considering a likely GDP deflator (based on year-average inflation) of 32 percent. 
For the new fiscal year, 2022-23, using Government’s real GDP growth of 9.2% and a 11.9% GDP 
deflator (using year-average inflation) yields a nominal GDP of Birr 7,465bn. An alternative projection 
using somewhat lower growth (6.5%) alongside somewhat higher inflation (23% year-average) would 
yield a moderately higher nominal GDP of Birr 7,996bn for this fiscal year.

Budgetary Growth Rates:  
 
• 
Comparing this year’s budget document figures to last year’s budget figures, expenditure growth is 
programmed to rise by 40% while revenue growth (excluding grants) is seen to rise by 19%.  
 
• 
Both of these would be moderately positive in real terms if the budget assumption of 12% year-
average inflation is realized; more realistically, however, if inflation turns out higher this year (we 
forecast 23% year-average inflation for the fiscal year) these nominal growth rates will amount to 
strong expenditure growth on a real basis but a decline for revenue collections in real terms. 
 
• 
Comparing this year’s budget document figures to the likely outturns for FY 2021-22, however, shows 
much stronger (planned) revenue growth versus last year. Revenue is expected to show a 37% 
nominal increase from last year (14% in real terms using projected 23% year-average inflation) but 
expenditure versus last year will be up just 22% in nominal terms (essentially flat in real terms), 
reflecting the large spending increases—including supplementary budgets—that took place last year.

Revenue Trends and Composition:  
 
• 
Revenue outturns in FY 2021-22 show an overall 87 percent performance achievement relative to the 
set budget, with tax revenues doing much better (88% of the budget) than non-tax revenue (73% of 
budget). External grants were well below budget expectations, at 42% of anticipated levels.   
 
• 
For the new fiscal year, revenue is set to rise to Birr 439bn, up from last year’s Birr 320bn estimated 
outturn, or growth of 37 percent. This is not as stretched as may seem at first glance, given inflation 
is currently running at 37 percent (though likely to moderate to 22% on a year-average basis). New 
tax policy measures are also being put in place, including a broadening of the VAT and excise tax base, 
new fuel excises, various tax administration initiatives, and a new property tax regime (for which a 
proclamation is expected this fiscal year though full implementation is likely only in FY 2023-24). 
 
• 
The specific revenue targets set in the budget, across 17 main sub-categories and 163 detailed line-
items are presented in Table 7 on the next page.

Expenditure Trends over time: 
 
• 
This year’s expenditure growth versus last year’s outturn is targeted to be 22 percent in nominal terms 
(roughly flat in real terms) and seems to reflect more pronounced macro concerns now about the 
need to limit inflation and debt accumulation. 
 
• 
Relative to the size of the economy, total expenditure will also be at a decade low of just 10.5 percent 
of GDP, versus a high of 18.8 percent of GDP in FY 2012-13.

Expenditure Items: Top 10, Highest Growth, and Lowest Growth Line-items 
 
• 
For the first time in many years, funding for roads is no longer the largest budgetary line-item, being 
replaced instead by allocations for debt service (Birr 126bn) and defence (Birr 84bn). Shifts in policy 
priorities are also reflected in line-items showing substantial increments from last year, most notably 
for transfers/subsidies (up 9.6x), defence (up 3.8x), and debt service (up 2.8x) 
 
• 
Conversely, line-items showing limited growth include Urban Development and Construction as well 
as Agriculture and Rural development. Several notable budget categories—such as health, education, 
trade, and industry—are showing essentially flat levels vs last year’s budget allocations.

Expenditure Quality: Poverty-Reducing Expenditure, Wages, and Government Capital Expenditure  
 
• 
Increased allocations for defence and debt service have reduced the share of the budget devoted to 
directly poverty-reducing expenditure, which is now near 60% of total vs 80% a few years ago.  
 
• 
Another consequence of higher defence and debt service allocations is that capital expenditure—
though rising in nominal terms—is falling as a share of the budget and as a share of GDP. 
 
• 
With respect to the Government wage bill, this will reach Birr 76bn this year, or 10% of the budget. 
At just 1% of GDP, however, it is at the low end of the wage/GDP ratios seen in African/EM countries. 
 
• 
The specific expenditure allocations put forth in the budget, across 18 main sub-categories and 227 
detailed line-items are presented in Table 12 on the next two pages.

Overall Financing of the Budget 
 
• 
Total government borrowing of Birr 308bn (4.1 percent of GDP) will be needed to cover the deficit 
projected for this year. Around 85 percent of this total (Birr 266bn) is to be borrowed from domestic 
lenders, while the remaining 15 percent (Birr 43bn or ~$776mn) is to be covered by foreign loans.  
 
• 
The composition of deficit financing has shifted sharply towards domestic sources of funds in recent 
years; foreign financing comprised as much as 70 percent of the deficit financing in 2019-20, but is 
now down to just 14 percent of total budget deficit financing.

External Financing Trends for the Budget 
 
• 
Budgetary grants of close to $706mn are anticipated this fiscal year, with the largest sources in the 
budget shown as coming from the World Bank, the EU, AfDB, UK, and US. 
 
• 
External budgetary borrowing of $776mn is, in turn, largely anticipated from World Bank loans, 
supplemented also by some limited bilateral loans from countries such as China and Italy.  
 
• 
It is worth noting that the sum of budgetary grants and loans does not represent the full amount of 
external funding and assistance that flows into Ethiopia. On the grant side, a substantial amount of 
non-budget grants flow directly to non-government entities such as NGOs, aid agencies, 
food/humanitarian relief suppliers, and private beneficiaries; this amounted to $1.7bn last year, per 
balance of payments data, and will likely rise further this year reflecting large humanitarian and relief 
related aid flows. On the lending side too, not included in budgetary loan figures are borrowings by 
state enterprises and by private corporates with the ability/approval to contract loans from abroad; 
this amounted to near $1bn last year, per balance of payments data, and will also likely rise further 
this year reflecting healthier balance sheets at some SOEs, Ethiopian Airlines aircraft purchases, and 
improving conditions for private corporates seeking out external borrowing.

Debt Rollover Requirements in FY 2022-23: Treasury Bills  
 
• 
Besides the need for new domestic borrowing of Birr 266bn to cover the budget deficit, Government 
will also need to rollover the large volume of T-Bills whose repayments are falling due this year.  
 
• 
By our estimates, given the stock of T-Bills issued last fiscal year and taking into account their short 
maturities (mostly 182-day and 365-day tenors), an average Birr 23bn will be falling due in each of 
the coming 12 months, for a total of Birr 279bn during the 2022-23 fiscal year.  
 
• 
With such high demands on local debt markets, T-Bill rates (currently near 8%) will likely trend higher 
to 10% or the low teens during the course of the fiscal year.  In the near-term, the Government’s use 
of local lenders to finance most of its deficit will work to absorb credit supplies that would have 
otherwise been channelled to the private sector. However, such adverse impacts should gradually be 
minimized in the coming quarters as foreign funding inflows improve over the medium-term.

Trends in Debt and Debt Service Composition:  
 
• 
With reduced foreign loans being contracted in the past few years, and a much higher reliance on 
local borrowing, domestic debt now makes up slightly more than half of total public debt versus 33 
percent ten years ago. 
 
• 
In parallel, more than half of this year’s Birr 126bn of Government debt service will be going to repay 
domestic lenders, up sharply from last year when just 29% of such payments went to local lenders.

Ethiopia’s Budget Deficits and Debt in a Cross-Country Context:  
 
• 
Ethiopia’s budget deficit levels have mostly stayed within a narrow range of 3 to 4 percent of GDP 
over the past decade, and generally compare favorably versus other peer countries.  
 
• 
Seen in a cross-country context, Ethiopia’s public debt-to-GDP ratio (at 53% of GDP in FY 2020-21 and 
an estimated 48% in 2021-22) also compares favorably versus the 74% of GDP average for African 
countries and the 85% of GDP average for emerging markets.
