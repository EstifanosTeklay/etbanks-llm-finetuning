We review the sources of the recent spike in Ethiopia’s inflation. To this end, we 
collected and tabulated the Central Statistical Authority’s monthly price data by 
detailed product lines (covering the 600-plus items that make up the inflation 
index) and by key analytical categories (food vs non-food, goods vs services and 
imported vs local items). In addition, we explore a range of possible explanatory 
factors—monetary developments, supply-side shocks, administratively-set price 
changes, global price pressures, exchange rate pass-through, wholesale/retail 
market structures, and public expectations—and offer our views on their 
relative significance in explaining Ethiopia’s current inflationary episode. 
 
Ethiopia’s inflation rate has remained stubbornly high in recent months, and 
reached a five-year high of close to 18 percent in August 2019, despite having 
dropped briefly to single-digit levels at the end of 2018. Notable features of the 
current inflationary episode include: 
 
§ Four consecutive months of above 15 percent inflation: Year-on-year 
inflation has remained in the range of 15-18 percent between May and 
August 2019, up significantly from the 9.3 percent inflation registered as 
recently as November 2018 (Table 1).  
 
§ High month-on-month-inflation: While the end of the fiscal year normally 
shows high levels of monthly inflation, this year’s outturns were much higher 
than normal, with month-on-month price increases of 4.3%, 1.5%, 1.3%, and 
2.4% over the past four months. The peak rate of 4.3 percent m-o-m inflation 
in May 2019 was the highest seen in seven years (Table 2).   
 
§ Food vs non-food items: As of end-August, food inflation of 23 percent was 
roughly double the 12 percent rate for non-food items. Given the 54 percent 
weight of food in Ethiopia’s price index (one of the world’s highest), the high 
rate of food price increases dominates developments in the overall cost-of-
living index. Within food, some widely consumed items showing high price 
increases were bread and cereals, including teff (prices up 26.7%), 
vegetables (+37.6%), meat (+25.7%) and edible oils (+6.7%). Food and non-
food inflation closely followed each other for most of the past five years, but 
began to show a major divergence starting in April 2019 (Table 3).     
 
§ Goods vs services: Based on our estimates, goods inflation was around 19.8 
percent at end-August, while services inflation was much more modest at 
12.1 percent as of August 2019 on year-on-year basis (Table 4).

§ Imports vs local products: Inflation of domestically produced products was 
22.8 percent by our estimation, while inflation of imported items was less 
than half that rate at only 10.3 percent (Table 4).  
 
§ Regional variations: Regional variations in inflation rates remain large, with 
some regions showing twice the rate of price increases as others. Tigray, 
Harari, and Benishangul Gumuz registered the highest inflation rates (25.3%, 
23.7%, and 23.3% respectively) while Dire Dawa, Gambela, and SNNP are 
among those with the lowest rates (13.0%, 13.4%, and 14.8%) (Tables 5). 
 
The sources of inflation 
 
At least seven potential explanatory variables can be considered as underlying 
sources of inflation, based on the macroeconomic literature and given Ethiopia’s 
specific circumstances. These contributory factors include: 
 
§ Monetary developments: Money supply growth beyond the economy’s 
capacity to absorb and expand real economic activity generally leads to 
inflation. In this context, a review of Ethiopia’s money supply data for the 
past two years show a slowdown in money supply growth just as there has 
been a rise in recorded inflation.  Broad money supply rose by 19.6 percent 
as of March 2019 (latest available date), which is a much more restrained 
growth rate from the 29 percent annual growth observed in both June 2017 
and June 2018.  In addition, growth in central bank base money has turned 
sharply lower, registering 9.6 percent growth as of March 2019 as opposed 
to growth rates of 23 percent and 19 percent seen at the end of the last two 
fiscal years. Growth in central bank lending to the government (3 percent 
year-on-year as of March 2019) is also now much lower than the growth 
rates seen one or two years ago.  At first glance, therefore, money supply 
growth does not appear to be an obvious contributor to the recent spike in 
inflation and, if anything, inflation has been rising despite a sharp slowdown 
in the growth of various measures of money supply (Table 6).  
 
§ Supply-side shocks and disruptions: Sharp declines in the supplies of key 
commodities, due either to a fall in output or the failure of harvested 
supplies to reach consumer markets, can lead to jumps in the prices of those 
affected products. In this context, a key question is whether there has been 
a drop in the output of major crops and/or a disruption to the transport, 
logistics, or marketing chains of these crops.  On both counts, the data seem 
to at least partly suggest that this has been the case. 
 
o Output effects: While virtually all food items showed price increases 
this past year, those whose output fell this year have shown larger price 
jumps—on average—than those whose output rose. More specifically, 
crops whose output fell over the past fiscal year showed average price 
increases of 23 percent from year-ago levels, while crops whose output 
increased have shown price increases (excluding outliers) of 19 percent

from year-ago levels.1 Looking specifically at some widely consumed 
food items, one observes a notable correlation between output drops 
and higher prices—as is the case for onions (output down 11%, prices 
up 78%), lentils (output down 20%, prices up 50%), tomatoes (output 
down 15%, prices up 29%), and carrots (output down 41%, prices up 
60%) (Tables 7A,7B, 8) 
 
o Distribution effects: Besides trends in output levels, the distribution of 
particular food items may be just as important—to the extent that 
harvested produce does not reach its intended markets in the desired 
time and quantities. In this context, public officials and sector 
participants have suggested that transport interruptions took place in 
the months of April-June, as large numbers of transport trucks were 
directed to address urgent wheat and fertilizer imports on the Addis-
Djibouti corridor, implicitly leaving less resources available for internal 
transport of food items.  This is a plausible explanation and seems 
corroborated by large fertilizer/wheat imports in April-June and by 
anecdotal information that transport resources were indeed diverted 
to the Djibouti port in the months just preceeding the rainy season. The 
interruption of normal transport flows to certain regions (linked in a 
few cases to localized unrest) might have also been a notable 
contribution to those regions with the highest inflation.   
 
§ Administered Prices: Changes in government-controlled prices can 
contribute to inflation as policy decisions to raise prices automatically feed 
through to inflation, especially if those prices have high weights in the CPI 
index. In this context, administratively set prices in Ethiopia include fuel, 
electricity, water, telecom charges, and government distributed staples such 
as bread, wheat, sugar, and cooking oil.2  Announcements of planned policy 
changes can also have an impact, as appears to have been the case for 
passenger vehicles (whose prices rose sharply due to expectations of tighter 
restrictions on the permitted age of used car imports). Using official price 
data for Addis Ababa’s inflation index, for example, we find that wheat 
products (wheat flour, wheat bread, white wheat), cars, sugar, and cooking 
oil had large price increases from year-ago levels and that several of these 
had material weights in the CPI index (2.44 percent, 1.06 percent, 0.91 
percent, and 1.70 percent respectively). By our calculations, about 1 
percentage point of the 16.7 percent year-on-year Addis Ababa inflation can 
be attributed to changes in such administratively-set prices (Table 9).  
 
§ Imported inflation: For August 2019, domestically produced goods and/or 
commodities (excluding services) contributed more to inflation (20 to 27 
percent) than imported commodities inflation (10.3 percent).  For the latter, 
given the Birr’s near 7 percent decline from year-ago levels, only about 3 
                                                        
1 Based on CSA's Agriculture Sample Survey data for the 2018-19 crop harvest released in 
June 2019, and excluding one outlier (garlic) with unusually large price changes (+133%).  
2 Only bakeries securing government-subsidized wheat are subject to bread-related price 
controls, while those who do not access such wheat supplies are free to set their own prices.

percentage points of the 10 percent inflation in imported goods can 
potentially be attributed to global price increases. This indicates that global 
price pressures have not been the main contributors to the inflationary surge 
in the country, pointing instead to the role of mainly domestic developments 
and conditions (Table 10). 
 
§ Exchange rate pass-through: A sizeable exchange rate depreciation can raise 
the Birr prices of imported items and thus affect the consumer price index 
(CPI) in proportion to the share of imports in the CPI index. We estimate 17 
to 30 percent of the CPI index is comprised of imports or products that utilize 
mainly imported inputs—thus impacting the CPI to this proportion. For the 
year to August 2019, the Birr depreciation has been 6.3 percent but the 
decline in the currency has been a more significant 24 percent considering 
the two year period to August 2019.  To the extent that one considers the 
cumulative two-year impact of the Birr depreciation, and taking the 
estimated share of imports in the CPI at between 17 to 30 percent, then the 
exchange rate pass-through would be on the order of 4 to 7 percentage 
points.  Indeed, a comparison of low-inflation vs high-inflation periods over 
the past decade would suggest that years following Birr devaluations tend to 
stand out for showing comparatively higher inflation rates (Table 11).  
 
§ Wholesale and retail markets: The structure of wholesale and retail markets 
can affect price levels—reflecting, for example, the number of competitive 
players and/or the existence of monopolistic or oligopolistic structures. 
However, it is difficult to attribute a spike in inflation to the nature of 
wholesale/retail markets unless there was some fundamental change in 
these structures during that inflationary episode. In Ethiopia’s case, we find 
it hard to pinpoint such sudden recent changes in wholesale/retail markets 
or structures, and indeed sense that markets for most food products are 
quite diverse and comprised of numerous suppliers, wholesalers, and 
retailers. Accordingly, the view that wholesale/retail market structures are 
to blame for high inflation seems hard to accept without any apparent shifts 
in the structure or competitiveness of those markets. 
 
§ Public expectations and confidence: Public sentiment on current and 
prospective economic and political conditions can, in principle, contribute to 
inflationary expectations and become a self-fulfilling prophecy whereby 
expectations of high inflation do indeed generate high inflation. In this 
regard, broader political and economic developments can lead the public to 
anticipate upcoming price increases—for example a sharp jump in the 
parallel market rate can generate such expectations as can political tensions 
and unrest. Such developments were partly evident in the March-June 
period and it is possible that they made some modest contribution to 
inflation—though quantifying their precise effects is of course difficult.

Given all of the above contributory factors, what conclusion should we draw 
about their relative significance and the most important culprits? In our 
judgement, the underlying sources for Ethiopia’s current inflationary episode 
can be grouped as follows:  
 
§ Least Important: We would first rule out those that seem least significant in 
explaining the rise in Ethiopia’s inflation, namely the structure of 
wholesale/retail markets, imported inflation, and administrative price 
changes. As noted earlier, without any material change in wholesale/retail 
markets in recent months, blaming such market structures for rising inflation 
seems erroneous. And with respect to the impact of imported inflation and 
administered prices, their estimated magnitudes are seen to be very limited, 
at perhaps just 1 percentage point of the observed 17.9 percent inflation.   
 
§ Moderate impacts: We would identify two contributors as having moderate 
impacts, namely monetary factors and exchange rate pass-through effects: 
 
o On monetary policy, beyond the already observed slowdown in 
money supply growth, the fact that most non-food and services 
categories did not have high inflation suggests that monetary factors 
were likely less relevant (one would reasonably expect high inflation 
across most products if monetary factors had been more dominant). 
Still, while monetary factors haven’t worsened inflation, it is also the 
case that they might have helped make inflation somewhat lower had 
there been even tighter policies than actually pursued (if, say, recent 
growth in broad money was lower than 20 percent or if, for example, 
credit growth at private banks was kept more restrained than the 43 
percent growth rate observed as of June 2019) (Table 12).   
 
o Regarding exchange rate pass-through effects, Ethiopia does tend to 
experience sharp jumps in inflation following a devaluation (Table 
12A). For example, inflation averaged just 8.7 percent during the 
twelve months prior to the October 2017 devaluation but then 
averaged 15.0 percent for the twelve months after the devaluation (or 
an extra 6.3 percentage points for a 15 percent devaluation). Such a 
pass-through is not far off from the elasticitiy estimates of recent IMF 
empirical analysis, which suggests a 30 percent pass-through (of 
exchange rate adjustments to inflation) and thus 4.3 percentage 
points of extra inflation—all else equal—following a 15 percent 
devaluation.3 But taking a two-year cumulative view since the 2017 
devaluation appears unjustified, as the current inflationary episode 
(May-August 2019) started more than 18 months after the October 
2017 devaluation and was preceeded by roughly six months of near 
single-digit inflation between November 2018 and April 2019 (Table 
12B). Indeed, by the beginning of 2019, pass-through effects from the 
                                                        
3 See IMF’s 2017 Article IV Report released January 2018 and also World Bank’s November 
2018 note on “Ethiopia: Impacts of the Birr Devaluation on Inflation”.

October 2017 devaluation are likely to have been minimal. Only the 
gradual exchange rate crawl of around 6 percent per year could be 
seen as having contributed to some extra inflation as of mid-2019, but 
the amounts attributable to this gradual exchange rate depreciation 
would be of minor magnitudes (just 1.8 percentage points out of the 
17.9 percent inflation, based on the IMF’s pass-through estimates for 
the one-year impact of a 6 percent depreciation).  
 
§ Main contributor: This leaves the most significant culprit, in our view, as 
food-related supply-side shocks, involving a combination of lower harvests 
and transport disruptions. As noted above, the main underlying food items 
contributing to inflation are readily quantifiable and identified to be “just 
vegetables and cereals”—or perhaps even more narrowly ‘just onions and 
teff’.  Indeed, a scenario analysis shows that if just these two categories had 
experienced only moderate inflation over the past year (say 5 percent each), 
then end-August 2019 inflation figure would have been only 9.9 percent 
rather than the actual outturn of 17.9 percent.  
 
Implications and Outlook 
 
To summarize, the most significant culprit for Ethiopia’s recent inflation 
appears to have been a supply-side shock that affected two items with high 
weights in the Ethiopian consumer basket (vegetables and cereals); most 
tellingly, excluding these two items, inflation is actually just below 10 percent. 
Of course, the fact that inflation arose mainly from ‘just vegetables and cererals’ 
does not make it any less adverse or burdensome for the general public, but it 
does suggest—in our view—that: (1) the recent inflation should have a 
temporary duration once these crop-specific shocks dissipate with the upcoming 
harvest (via the restoration of normal supplies and transport services); (2) an 
abrupt tightening of monetary or fiscal policies appears unnecessary for now (as 
macro tightening is an inappropriate response to a food price shock and could 
instead hurt private sector growth); and (3) radical measures against wholesale 
and retail outlets are probably not very helpful at this point and might even be 
counter-productive if available supplies of these widely consumed commodities 
dwindle even further from current levels.4  
 
In terms of the inflation outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, a return 
to single-digit inflation is not likely any time soon. Indeed, the analysis above 
suggests that: (1) food inflation will remain quite elevated until harvests from 
the new crop year begin to reach food markets in late 2019; and (2) current 
macroeconomic conditions and rates of money supply growth seem consistent 
with and contributing to ‘underlying’ non-food and services inflation of 10-12 
percent. At the same time, inflationary pressures from some previously 
                                                        
4 The January 2011 episode of government enacting price controls and taking actions against 
retail outlets is instructive in this regard. In that case, these measures did not manage to control 
inflation (which went on to double from 17% in January 2011 to around 34% a year later) and 
were discontinued gradually over time.

important sources should be low and subdued for the period ahead—whether 
considering administered price changes (no major policy shifts are announced), 
imported inflation (IMF’s WEO projections show low commodity price 
increases), or exchange rate pass-through effects (the budget does not indicate 
and neither do we foresee a devaluation this fiscal year).  Taken all together, and 
as noted in our Quarterly Macroeconomic Review of Q2:2019, we forecast 
inflation to remain in the mid-teens until the start of the crop harvesting period 
(October-December), and expect much lower inflation rates to appear only in 
early 2020 when favourable base effects (i.e. the high index level in early 2019) 
help produce lower year-on-year inflation figures and allow inflation to fall 
towards 10 percent by the end of the fiscal year (June 2020) (Table 13). It is of 
course possible that some new shocks could keep the inflation rate in the mid-
teens even up to mid-2020, for example due to: (1) major political unrest or 
destabilizing events that adversely affect public expectations; (2) a jump in global 
oil prices that feeds through many local prices; or (3) a rapid freeing of 
government-set prices for widely consumed staples and services. For the 
moment, however, we see all three of these as unlikely to materialize and thus 
do not consider them as major risks to our baseline projections for the current 
fiscal year.    
 
Finally, we provide a snapshot of the underlying product-by-product drivers of 
Ethiopia’s inflation by tabulating publicly released CSA data on price levels for 
both Addis Ababa and on a nation-wide basis. The appendices contain price 
level data covering: (1) Food items showing the highest nation-wide price 
increases over the past year (Table 14A); (2) Non-food items showing the highest 
nation-wide price increases over the past year (Table 14B); (3) a ranking of the 
Addis Abeba CPI index components showing the highest price increases over the 
past year (Table 15A); (4) a ranking of the Addis Ababa CPI index components 
with the largest weights (Table 15B); (5) a listing of the 600-plus products used 
for the construction of the nation-wide inflation index (Table 16A); and (6) a 
listing of the near-200 products used to compile Addis Ababa’s consumer price 
index (Table 16B).
