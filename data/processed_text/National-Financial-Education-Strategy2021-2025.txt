The National Bank of Ethiopia has developed the National Financial Education Strategy 2021-
2025 in close collaboration with all key stakeholders including development partners on financial 
inclusion and financial education. Various institutional and individual counter parts in the public, 
private and social sectors have been involved throughout the process, and have shared their time, 
experience and insights to the development of this document. The NBE is extremely grateful to its 
counterparts for their support and would like to reiterate the commitment to continue to join the 
efforts for the successful implementation of the National Financial Education Strategy 2021-
2025.The NBE would also like to thank to its partners, specifically the World Bank Group and the 
Financial Education Working members for their support throughout the development of this 
strategy.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
1. Introduction 
Financial education refers to the process of bringing and building basic knowledge, skills, 
attitudes, confidence and behaviors of target groups to enable them understand, select, make use of 
and manage financial products and services that fit their needs.  Currently, different financial 
education programs and efforts have been undergoing in Ethiopia by self-initiated NGOs with 
extensive support from donors, the government in a school curriculum and that steered by the 
financial institutions with the aim to aware their clients and the general public about the products 
and services on offer. Due to the absence of financial education strategy, however, these efforts 
are sporadic, uncoordinated and lack strategic focus and goal.  Consequently, financial literacy 
and capability in Ethiopia are at the lowest stage compared even with peers in Sub-Sahara African 
and negatively influence the level of financial inclusion.  Roughly, 82 percent of the unbanked 
adults reported not owning an account due to lack of financial literacy or awareness. With this 
background, the National Financial Education Strategy has been formulated to provide for a 
coherent, collaborative and institutionally coordinated approach that synchronizes all efforts 
towards achieving a commonly shared and envisioned national goals and targets.     
 
2. Current status of financial education  
Financial Capability Survey-Ethiopia, conducted by the WBG in 2017, uncovered the low level of 
financial literacy and capability with a significant gap remains particularly between rural and 
urban and men and women adults:  
 While only 24 percent of rural adults own transaction accounts, adults in urban areas own 
29 percent;  
 Lack of financial literacy or awareness affected more women than men. Roughly 85 percent 
of unbanked women reported not knowing how or where to open an account as opposed to 
80 percent of men; 
 Women are less aware of financial terms than their male counterparts.  88 percent of male 
respondents have heard or know about public banks, as compared to only 78 percent of 
women. Women are also less likely to know how to open an account or consider 
alternatives before selecting a financial product than men; 
 Roughly 14 percent of rural adults have heard or know about ATMs compared to 71 
 
 
vii 
 
percent of urban adults;  
 Women displayed significantly lower financial numeracy and literacy skill than their male 
counterparts. About 78 percent of male respondents can perform division while only 65 
percent of surveyed women can do the same. Similarly, 45 percent of men understand the 
concept of inflation as compared to 38 percent of women;  
 A little over half of surveyed group reported always planning how their money will be 
spent, and only 42 percent always stick to their plan; and  
 Roughly 90 percent of the surveyed people reported seeking advice from their immediate 
social network before making an important financial decision. Around 59 percent of women 
reported receiving financial advice specifically from their spouse or partner, while men tend 
to rely more broadly on family and friends instead. Furthermore, those women in rural areas 
reported usage of some information from radio in addition to depending on their community 
leaders for information. 
 
This has put Ethiopia among countries that have low level of financial literacy, capability and 
financial inclusion.   
 
3. The current financial education programs 
The current financial education efforts in Ethiopia can be grouped into three broad categories that 
have been steered by the: 
i. Financial sector: To raise awareness to targeted clients and the general public, players in 
the financial sector run different  programs through different media;  
ii. Government: Ministry of Education has curriculums specifically dealing with financial 
education tropics under Civics and Ethical Education subjects for Grade 5 -12. Ministry of 
Finance as well has financial literacy package to the beneficiaries of the Productive Safety 
Net Program.  Federal Cooperative Agency‟s runs specially designed financial education 
programs for the cooperative societies; and   
iii. Non-profit or donor organizations: Provide financial education for adults in their own 
initiatives which are the most common in Ethiopia. 
 
 
viii 
 
 
This Strategy capitalizes on these efforts to steer and speed up the financial education processes in 
Ethiopia. Sporadic efforts will be coordinated and directed towards achieving commonly shared 
national goals and targets of the NFES as assorted in the main documents.   
 
4. Barriers to financial education  
Although there are different and specific barriers to the low level of financial literacy and 
capability in Ethiopia, the overarching challenges can be grouped in to the following four strategic 
pillars: i/ Underdeveloped financial education infrastructure and limited centers; ii/ Fragmented 
programs, modules and ineffective delivery channels; iii/ Unsustainable dissemination and rollout; 
and iv/ Absence of coordination, monitoring and evaluation system. 
 
The purpose of this National Financial Education Strategy is, therefore, directed to provide a 
coherent, institutionally coordinated and focused approach to financial education delivery that 
will enhance the financial literacy and capability of millions of targeted groups by strategically 
addressing the foregoing challenges and barriers.  
 
5. Strategic framework 
Mission 
The mission of the National Financial Education Strategy is: 
“To improve and increase the financial literacy and capability of adults, households and 
enterprises, through financial education, to enable them make informed financial decisions”.  
 
Vision statement 
The vision of the National Financial Education Strategy is:  
“Ensure that adults, households and enterprises in Ethiopia are capable of making well- 
informed financial decisions and ultimately improving their financial well-being by 2025”. 
 
 
 
 
 
ix 
 
Main strategies 
The following strategic pillars, which are derived from and aligned with the foregoing overarching 
underlying barriers, are formulated to translate the above stated vision and mission of the NFES to 
a reality:   
Strategy 1:  
Build robust national financial education infrastructure; 
Strategy 2:  
Design and implement impactful national financial education programs, 
modules and channels; 
Strategy 3: 
 Ensure sustainable dissemination and rollout to reach scale; and  
Strategy 4:  
Build and implement effective coordination, monitoring and evaluation 
system. 
 
Each of these strategic pillars is followed by specific programs: Rural Program, Women Program, 
Youth Program, Children Program and General Public Program.  Specific modules with respect to 
saving, credit, insurance, payment and pension have also been packaged under each the programs1.    
Priority actions have been well identified and assorted in main document.   
 
Analysis of preference of delivery of financial education indicated that women and most rural 
adults have a preference to learn about financial products and services through the local 
government office like kebele officials. Male respondents and urban adults reported a preference to 
learn through TV or advertisements and agents of financial service providers. For rural adults, face 
to face interactions were indicated as the preferred mode of delivery at the local Kebele level, 
followed by audio technologies. In view of these, the method and medium of delivery of the 
financial education have been adequately considered.   
 
 Financial education targets 
The NFES aims to ensure 75% of adults to report their awareness about financial products and 
services by 2025 from the current baseline of 47%. This would be complemented by a supply 
side target that roughly 10 million adults to be educated during the strategy period, 2021-2025.   
As part of the Financial Education Results Framework, therefore, high-level KPIs have been set 
                                                          
 
1 To reconsider opportunities, challenges and emerging incidents that dictate basic changes in the main elements of the strategy, a mid-term 
review of the strategy has been planned to be carried out by the end of 2023.    
 
 
x 
 
to monitor and evaluate the progress and impacts of the financial education efforts.    
 
6.  Coordination and institutional arrangements  
Linkages with NFIS governance structure 
The National Financial Education Strategy capitalizes on the existing governance structure of the 
National Financial Inclusion Strategy and purported to establish a Directorate to execute this 
strategy as well as the routines of the financial consumers‟ protection framework. The structures 
comprise of: 
 
i. The National Council for Financial Inclusion;   
 
ii. The National Financial Inclusion Steering Committee; 
 
iii. The National Bank of Ethiopia; and 
 
iv. The Financial Education and Consumer Protection Directorate housed at the National 
 
Bank of Ethiopia2 
 
7. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) 
To ensure effective implementation of the NFES: to track progresses, identify bottlenecks and 
measure impacts of the implementation of the strategy, a robust and well-planned M&E 
framework has been formulated.  
  
8. Funding the implementation of the NFES 
Implementing the NFES strategy, among others, assumes the deployment and use of large number 
of trainers that will serve around the nation, such as Development Agents (DA) of MoA, self-
initiated NGOs‟ and donors. These efforts call for training of trainers, development, printing and 
dissemination of education materials and top up for the trainers on the field such as DAs‟ of MoA 
etc. These require financial outlay. Bearing these in mind, the NBE may consider various funding 
options and approaches to support the implementation of this Strategy. The funding options may 
include, but not limited to, self-funding, donors fund and pooled funding depending on the sources. 
                                                          
 
2 To implement the NFES and Financial Consumer protection tasks, a Financial Education and Consumers Protection Directorate (CPFED) has been 
proposed in the NFES and approved by the board of the NBE.

1. INTRODUCTION 
According to the 2017 Findex Survey3, an estimated 1.7 billion adults remain unbanked globally4, 
and are excluded from the use of formal financial services. In Ethiopia, an estimated 36.7 
million adults do not own any type of formal transaction account. In a concerted effort to reduce 
financial exclusion and address the needs of the people, the National Bank of Ethiopia launched an 
ambitious National Financial Inclusion Strategy5 (NFIS) in October 2017. 
 
In Ethiopia, one underlying barrier to financial inclusion is the low level of financial capability 
and awareness among Ethiopian adults. Being financially capable means having the financial 
knowledge, skills, attitudes, confidence and behaviors to manage financial resources and 
understand, select, and make use of financial services that fit one‟s needs6. Having sufficient 
financial capability is critical in the context of financial inclusion as it helps to improve 
individuals‟ and households‟ financial well-being by enabling consumers to act in their own best 
financial interest. 
 
Increasing the levels of financial awareness and capability of adults is not only a core pillar of the 
NFIS, it also broadly contributes to the achievement of Ethiopia‟s reform programs. To help 
ensure that an appropriate range of financial services are offered to consumers with increased 
financial capability, the NFIS action plan includes the following financial literacy actions: (i) 
conducting a mapping of financial education / literacy initiatives; (ii) conducting of a baseline 
survey to assess the levels of financial capability, and relevant gaps; and (iii) developing a 
National Financial Education Strategy to drive financial literacy and capability progress forward 
in Ethiopia. 
 
In June 2016, a mapping of financial education was conducted to identify existing initiatives, 
assess gaps and highlight opportunities that can help drive progress on financial literacy in 
Ethiopia. This mapping exercise was followed by a financial capability survey (conducted

4 Unbanked in this context means without an account at a financial institution or through a mobile money provider. 
5 The strategy intends to help increase the percentage of Ethiopians that have access to a formal transaction account 
from 22 percent in 2014 (25 percent in 20164), to 60 percent by 2020

between January and June 2017) to establish a baseline measure of the levels of financial 
knowledge, behaviors, literacy and numeracy skills of different Ethiopian populations. 
 
In the absence of a financial education strategy, financial education efforts can be sporadic, 
uncoordinated and lack strategic focus. To this end, this National Financial Education Strategy has 
been designed to provide a coherent, institutionally coordinated and collaborative approach to 
financial education delivery. 
 
This National Financial Education Strategy defines the terms „Financial Capability‟, „Financial 
Education‟ and „Financial Literacy; as follows7: 
 
 
Financial education is a tool for increasing consumer financial literacy. According 
to OECD (2005), financial education is the process by which financial consumers and 
investors improve their understanding of financial products, services and concepts 
and, through information, instruction and objective advices, develop skills and 
confidence to become more aware of financial risks and opportunities to make 
informed choices, know where to go for help, and take other effective actions to 
improve their financial well-being. 
 
 
Financial literacy characterizes the level of aptitude in understanding personal 
finance. It often refers to awareness and knowledge of key financial concepts required 
for managing personal finances and is generally used as a narrower term than financial 
capability. 
 
 
Financial capability is the capacity of consumers to act in one‟s best financial 
interest, given socio-economic environmental conditions. It encompasses the 
knowledge (literacy), skills, attitudes, behaviors and confidence of consumers 
regarding managing their resources, and understanding, selecting and making use of 
financial services that fit their needs.8 
                                                          
 
7  Definitions based from (World Bank n.d.) 
8 Definitions based from World Bank. < http://responsiblefinance.worldbank.org/>

The terms financial education, literacy and capability are often used interchangeably, but 
represent very distinct concepts. In short, financial education is intended to increase the financial 
literacy of consumers, which enables individuals to become more financially capable (an 
outcome of improved financial literacy) when putting their knowledge into practice. 
 
This National Financial Education Strategy aims to: (i) analyze the current state of financial 
capability in Ethiopia, including key financial education programs; (ii) identify priority target 
populations and actions; (iii) provide guidance on how to establish and operationalize a financial 
education coordination structure including monitoring, evaluation and reporting systems; and 
(iv) include resources (annexed) to equip key stakeholders with knowledge and tools required to 
implement the strategy. The rest of this National Financial Education Strategy (NFES) is 
structured as follows: 
 Section 2 assesses the current state of financial capability in Ethiopia and capability 
levels of Ethiopians; 
 Section 3 takes stock of strategic financial education activities, gaps and opportunities; 
 Section 4 explains the purpose, rationale and vision of this NFES, as well as strategy 
priorities and areas of focus, based on evidence presented in Section 2; 
 Section 5 provides a strategy framework for action; 
 Section 6  provides details on the coordination structure and NFES institutional arrangements; 
 Section 7 details a comprehensive Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) framework to track 
financial education progress; and 
 Section 8 outlines priority actions of the NFES.

2. CURRENT STATE OF FINANCIAL CAPABILITY IN ETHIOPIA9 
2.1. 
Financial access and inclusion 
According to Global Findex10, access to a transaction account at a regulated institution among 
adults (ages 15+) has steadily grown from 22 percent in 2014 to 35 percent in 2017. However, a 
significant gap remains, particularly between rural and urban Ethiopian adults. Similarly, the recent 
Ethiopian Financial Capability Survey11   estimates account access to be 29 percent of adults 
aged 18+. However, the survey found that while roughly 61 percent of adults in urban areas own an 
account at either a bank, MFI or SACCO, rural populations lag behind. Only 24 percent of rural 
Ethiopian adults own a transaction account. Figure 3.1 below provides a breakdown of ownership 
of different financial products and services by Ethiopian adults. 
Figure 2.1: Ownership of Formal Financial Products and Services in Ethiopia 
 
 
 
 
Financial access varies greatly by region. Account access in Addis Ababa and Dira Dawa city is 
                                                          
 
9  The data analysis provided within this document is taken from the Ethiopia Financial Capability Survey 
in 2017 unless otherwise noted. 
10 World Bank Group, Global Findex Database. < https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/> 
11The Ethiopian Financial Capability survey was conducted between January – June, 2017. The survey 
forms the basis of the analysis (unless otherwise noted), and was conducted using a nationally 
representative sample of 3500 Ethiopians across different regions. The survey was conducted in 
coordination with the NBE and CSA.

roughly 70 percent and 83 percent respectively; however, the percentage of adults that own an 
account drops greatly, outside of those two cities. Account ownership also varies by region, and 
some regions like SNNPRS, Tigray and Amhara exhibit higher rates of financial inclusion than 
other regions like Somali, Oromia, Afar or Benishangul Gumze. Figure 2.2 below provides a 
breakdown of the level of financial exclusion by region (measured as lack of ownership of a 
formal financial product from a bank, MFI or SACCO). 
 
Figure 2.2 Account Access across Regions 
 
 
 
Most urban adults that own an account do so using either a public or private commercial bank (or 
both), whereas rural adults more frequently own products from either public banks or other 
financial service providers like MFIs or SACCOs. Roughly 61 percent of urban adults own an 
account – within this 61 percent, 90 percent own an account at the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 
(CBE) and 42 percent own an account at a private bank12. This suggests that most urban adults who 
own an account have more than one account within the formal financial sector. Approximately 24 
                                                          
 
12  Among the 61 percent of urban adults, some might have an account at the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia and 
another account at a private bank.

percent of rural adults own an account and they mainly report owning an account either at the CBE 
(61 percent) or with an MFI (68 percent), and 22 percent own an account through a SACCO. 
Rates of account ownership of the CBE are consistent with NBE supply side data, as roughly 
70 percent of the total number of accounts in Ethiopia are reported by the CBE. This may be due 
to the large coverage of the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) and their branch expansion plan 
into rural areas. 
 
Figure 2.3 Types of Account Ownership 
 
 
Few Ethiopians own a mobile money account (roughly 1 percent of adults). The vast majority of 
mobile money owners and users reside in urban areas. Therefore, mobile money products are not 
yet reaching rural adults. In general, mobile money awareness is low and only 13 percent of 
adults have heard of mobile money services (the majority living in urban areas). In addition, only 
50 percent of Ethiopian adults report regularly using a mobile phone (and only 43 percent of 
women). Lack of phone ownership or regular usage has implications on both access to and usage of 
mobile products and services. In addition, if adults, predominantly rural adults, are not using

Barriers to financial access 
Roughly 82 percent of unbanked adults reported not owning an account due to a financial 
literacy or awareness barrier. Lack of financial education, literacy and capability is a significant 
barrier to financial access and prevents adults (many of whom are transacting frequently within 
the informal sector) from accessing or using a formal financial product. Financial literacy as a 
barrier to account ownership disproportionately affects more women than men. Roughly 85 
percent of unbanked women reported not knowing how or where to open an account (as opposed 
to 80 percent of men). 
 
Other barriers to account access include not having enough money to transact or save. Roughly 
66 percent of unbanked adults reported not having enough money to appropriately use financial 
products or services. This often indicates that the respondents of the survey either did not think 
that they had enough money which warranted traveling to, opening and using an account or that 
the respondents did not have any cash left over after their daily expenses. However, of this 
group, 68 percent report using informal financial services like Iddir or Equb to manage risks and 
save. Therefore, there is a clear need to improve the levels of financial awareness and literacy 
levels in Ethiopia. This includes better understanding of non-traditional collaterals, credit 
reporting, and related financial opportunities. This will enable Ethiopian adults to be better 
informed about the range of products and services available to them. In addition, it will help adults 
understand how to open and use accounts, and how to take advantage of available formal financial 
services to help improve their financial well-being. 
 
2.3. 
Financial awareness 
Awareness of various financial products, services and concepts is pivotal to further enabling 
financial access and inclusion.  Basic awareness of financial products and services is a prerequisite 
to understanding and appropriately selecting the right financial tools to manage money and 
mitigate risks. However, many Ethiopians are unaware of basic terms associated with available 
financial products and services. Lack of awareness of financial products or delivery channels is 
often due to low level of exposure and access to various financial institutions and services. 
 
Overall Ethiopian women are less aware of financial terms than their male counterparts and may 
require further targeting to improve their financial awareness. For example, 88 percent of male 
 
 
8 
 
respondents have heard or know about public banks, as compared to only 78 percent of women. 
Roughly 79 percent of male respondents have heard or know about microfinance organizations, 
compared to only 66 percent of women. Ethiopian women are also less likely to know how to 
open an account or consider alternatives before selecting a financial product than men. This is 
further pronounced among rural women, where only 27 percent know how to open an account 
(as compared to 41 percent of men) and 34 percent report considering alternatives before selecting 
a financial product (as compared to 41 percent of men). 
 
Location is also a critical factor that correlates to levels of financial awareness, and rural adults are 
less aware of financial terms than their urban counterparts. For instance, only 14 percent of rural 
adults have heard or know about ATMs compared to 71 percent of their urban adult peers. A 
similar pattern is observed with awareness of other access points like bank agents, money transfer 
services, etc. For instance, only 34 percent of rural Ethiopians report knowing how to open an 
account at a bank or MFI, while knowledge on account opening is indeed much higher among 
urban adults (77 percent). 
 
Lack of education is also a key factor in financial awareness. Roughly 79 percent of adults with 
higher education are aware of ATMs as compared to only 22 percent with a primary education. 
These factors are often compounded, as rural adults, particularly women, receive less educational 
opportunities than their urban, particularly male, peers.

Financial numeracy and literacy 
As part of the National Financial Capability Survey, a financial literacy quiz was enumerated 
to all respondents. In general, Ethiopian‟s demonstrate having a good foundation of financial 
numeracy skills in some areas and correctly answered multiple financial numeracy questions 
within the quiz. Roughly 71 percent of Ethiopian adults were able perform basic division, 
and roughly 44 and 41 percent were able to demonstrate an understanding of discounting and 
inflation. 
 
Figure 2.5 Percentages of Adults Who Correctly Answered Financial Literacy Question Concepts 
 
 
Urban, male adults, particularly those who were already formally banked, hold higher levels of 
financial literacy than others. Women, on the other hand, displayed significantly lower financial 
capability and knowledge than their male counterparts. Significant gender gaps in understanding 
financial concepts emerged when answering various numeracy and financial literacy questions. 
For instance, roughly 78 percent of male respondents can perform division while only 65 percent 
of surveyed women can do the same. Similarly, 45 percent of men understand the concept of 
inflation as compared to 38 percent of women. Figure 2.6 below demonstrates the gender divide in 
understanding different financial concepts applied in a numeracy quiz and demonstrates that 
across all topics women scored less than men. It is interesting to note, however, that the gender 
gap is higher when quizzed on basic division (where many respondents had a broader range of 
education levels – or even no education at all) but that the gender gap narrows as education

levels increase, which is demonstrated by respondents who answer more difficult questions (like 
discounting) correctly. 
 
Figure 2.6 Understanding of Financial Concepts by Gender 
 
 
 
 
Significant divides between urban and rural Ethiopians also persists when testing for financial 
literacy and numeracy skills. For instance, 17 percent of rural adults were unable to answer any 
financial literacy quiz questions administered through the national financial capability survey, as 
compared to 9 percent of urban Ethiopians. Regional differences are also pervasive, as, for 
instance, those in Tigray regions lag behind on this quiz – with only 33 percent and 40 percent 
able to score above average (as opposed to 50 percent). Banked adults tend to have better 
knowledge of basic financial concepts – 75 percent score above average on the financial literacy 
quiz as compared to 53 percent of unbanked adults that score above average. This demonstrates 
that a correlation exists between lack of exposure and usage of financial services and lower 
financial literacy and numeracy levels.

Financial planning and money management 
Budgeting is a basic strategy to manage one‟s finances to meet expenses and reach financial 
goals. With respect to financial management, a little over half of surveyed Ethiopians report always 
planning how their money will be spent, and only 42 percent always stick to their plan. A much 
smaller percentage of adults actually keep track of their day-to-day spending (26 percent) and those 
that are banked are more likely to keep exact track as compared to adults that are not formally 
served. Adults that often stick to their plan or keep track of their day-to-day spending also tend to 
score higher on the financial literacy quiz. 
 
Almost all Ethiopians reported having a financial goal (94 percent). Some of the more important 
goals are to build or upgrade their home (38 percent), start a business (16 percent) or invest in a 
farm (15 percent). 91 percent of adult mention planning for their children‟s future as a financial 
goal. Almost all Ethiopians plan for their children‟s education by providing them with an 
education; this is quite consistent across gender, location, education and employment levels.

Learning preferences 
Ethiopian adults demonstrate a large appetite for learning more about formal financial services. 
Roughly 85 percent of Ethiopians indicate that they would like to learn more about services 
provided by banks, MFIs, debit cards and mobile money. However, different population groups 
also have different learning preferences. For instance, women and most rural adults prefer 
learning about financial products through the local government office like their kebele officials. 
Male respondents and urban adults reported a preference to learn through TV shows or 
advertisements and agents sent by financial service providers. For rural adults, face to face 
interactions were indicated as the preferred mode of education delivery at the local Kebele level, 
followed by audio technologies.

Sources of information 
Most Ethiopians (90 percent) report seeking advice from their immediate social network before 
making an important financial decision. However, men and women receive advice from different 
sources. Roughly 59 percent of women report receiving financial advice specifically from their 
spouse or partner, while men tend to rely more broadly on family and friends instead. 
 
Mass media tools like radio adverts or mobile phones are commonly used in financial education 
programs to raise awareness about money management. However, in Ethiopia, adoption of mass 
media and using it as a platform for information differs by location and gender. Therefore, many 
channels that policy makers typically leverage to provide financial messages or awareness may not 
reach the Ethiopian populations that need it most. For instance, only 32% of rural women regularly 
use a mobile phone and therefore mobile messaging campaigns may not reach them well.  
However, those in rural areas and women report high usage of radio in addition to depending on 
their community leaders for information, suggesting that radio programming is a good channel to 
reach a national audience, including people living in remote rural areas.

3. STOCK-TAKING OF KEY FINANCIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS 
To address low financial capability levels in Ethiopia, financial education programs were mapped 
as part of this NFES. The stock-taking of key financial education programs helps identify 
the range of current efforts and understand an approach for coordinating and building on past 
efforts. In Ethiopia, most financial education activities are integrated into a more general 
education initiative or coupled with the roll-out of a new financial service. The majority of 
financial education programs is donor-supported, relatively small scale and implemented over a 
limited time period13. 
 
Financial education efforts in Ethiopia can be grouped into three broad categories, 
 
i. Efforts by the financial sector to raise awareness among clients and provide financial 
education to the general public; 
ii. E f f o r t s  by the government at the national and regional levels to improve financial 
education levels. This includes the addition of a Financial Education Team in the national 
curriculum for grades 5 through 12 in the course on Civics and Ethical Education; 
iii. Efforts led by non-profit or donor organizations to provide financial education through 
various channels. Donor-driven initiatives for financial education are the most common 
in Ethiopia. 
A summary table of relevant financial education programs identified during the Ethiopian 
Financial Education Mapping exercise is available in Annex 8. 
 
3.1. 
Donor-led financial education programs 
Most financial education efforts in Ethiopia are donor-driven. There is an extensive network of 
international organizations that provide financial education programs. These are usually as part 
of a larger initiative and not necessarily specifically focused on financial education. 
 
One of the efforts was driven by CARE Ethiopia, which had created 2,59114 Villages Economic 
                                                          
 
13   A mapping exercise of financial education programs in Ethiopia was conducted to inform development of the 
National Financial Education Strategy.

and Social Associations having around 57,175 members that are enrolled in PSNP and educated 
under GRAD15 program.   Similarly, YouthStart, an initiative launched by UNCDF in partnership 
with MasterCard Foundation, aimed to increase access to financial services for low-income 
youth with an emphasis on savings and financial education and coordinated with Ethiopia ACSI 
and PEACE MFI to provide financial education to almost 280,000 youth. Such programs often 
develop a wealth of pre-tested and relevant financial education content and tools, adapted to the 
context of Ethiopia. These financial education experiences and materials can often be further 
leveraged and adopted by other programs or government initiatives to reduce duplication or re- 
inventing the wheel. 
3.2. 
Government-led financial education program 
Ministry of Education 
One of the few stand-alone financial education efforts in Ethiopia is the Ministry of Education‟s 
effort to incorporate a Financial Education Team in the national school curriculum for students in 
grades 5 through 12. This is taught as part of the Civics and Ethical Education course. The 
Ministry of Education is also undergoing a curriculum review in 2018. With coordination from 
donor-led financial education programs, the Ministry of Education in coordination with the NBE 
may be able to improve their financial education curricula and materials by further aligning to 
good practices, adopting relevant pre-tested content and understanding lessons learned from 
other large-scale financial education initiatives. 
 
Productive Safety Net Program 
Ethiopia‟s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) established in 2005, is an unconditional cash 
transfer program that reaches approximately 8 million households and includes a livelihood 
training that provides financial education for beneficiaries. PSNP beneficiaries who participated 
in the Livelihoods component under the Households Assets and Building Program (HABP) were 
incentivized to attend financial literacy trainings. However, the livelihoods component ended in 
2014 and many PSNP beneficiaries who are currently migrating to using mobile financial services 
have not received extensive financial literacy trainings. One barrier to providing financial 
education through the PSNP program is that there is no single financial institution, product or

service that reaches all beneficiaries. This poses a challenge to developing a standard 
programmatic approach to financial education delivery. 
 
Federal Cooperative Agency 
The Federal Cooperative Agency (FCA), which currently supervises and regulates nearly 20,000 
SACCOs, support Kebele-level SACCOs and RuSACCOs and to provide financial education to 
their respective members as well as community members. The program uses the HABP materials 
(used within the PSNP program). Coordination with the FCA in this initiative will be critical to 
successfully delivering financial education to rural Ethiopian adults, and the program can be 
enhanced by incorporating lessons learned from other programs in this space and leveraging 
additional materials. 
3.3. 
Financial sector programs 
Some banks and MFIs offer financial education to their clients. For instance, ENAT bank has 
developed financial education tools and financial literacy training targeted to women.  The 
training is delivered at all branches of the bank and includes educational dramas and games- 
based learning tools. Elements of such programs may be able to be standardized and encouraged 
by all banks nationwide. In addition, as part of the PSNP program, banks and MFIs offer some 
financial education when beneficiaries open an account to receive their cash disbursements 
digitally. However, the provision of financial education, particularly to low-income consumers, 
is not yet standardized in all banks or MFIs when an adult opens an account or gains access to 
other services. The provision of guidelines extending the process of disclosure and encouraging 
banks and MFIs to deliver key financial concepts and information to new customers at the point 
of first interaction and account opening should be considered.

4. OVERARCHING CHALLENGES TO FINANCIAL EDUCATION 
 
The level of financial inclusion in Ethiopia is around 35% (Findex Global survey of 
2017). This has labeled Ethiopia among the countries with low level of financial inclusion. 
Compared with peers in Sub-Saharan African countries like Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, 
Tanzania and the average of SSA that respectively registered 82%, 5 9 %, 50%, 47% and 
43%, Ethiopia is lagging behind.  Low level of financial literacy and capability are among the 
major overarching causes for the exclusion. Ethiopia Financial Capability Survey (2017) 
indicated that roughly 82 percent of unbanked adults reported not owning an account due to a 
financial literacy or awareness barrier and nearly 85 percent of unbanked women reported not 
knowing how or where to open an account (as opposed to 80 percent of men). The NFIS has also 
underscored the limited knowledge and awareness of adults, particularly in rural Ethiopia, about 
the regulated financial institutions, which are among the strategic causes for low level of financial 
inclusion in Ethiopia.  It further commends the need for conducting a national survey to gauge 
more precisely the current status of financial capability in Ethiopia and then to design a national 
strategy to coordinate effective priority measures to increase financial capability over time. 
 
Major barriers in providing financial education in Ethiopia, therefore, can be summarized within 
four overarching challenges: i/ Underdeveloped financial education infrastructure and limited 
centers; ii/ Fragmented programs, modules and ineffective delivery channels; iii/ Unsustainable 
dissemination and rollout; and iv/ Absence of coordination, monitoring and evaluation system. 
4.1. 
 Underdeveloped infrastructure and limited centers 
Many adults do not have access to quality, strategically delivered financial education. The absence 
of a well-designed national financial education infrastructure such as national strategy for 
financial education, limited delivery centers, nationally responsible and coordinating body, 
committed and dedicated working group are among the fundamental barriers to sustainably run the 
programs in an organized manner. Lack of clearly identified education centers, clear guidelines 
and procedures that help to steer the national financial education endeavors, among others, deter 
the promotion of financial education in Ethiopia. The absence of fund dedicated to scale up certain 
programs and support financial education centers in a planned and certain ways has its negative 
consequence in the promotion of financial education at the national level.  
 
 
18 
 
4.2. 
Fragmented programs, modules and ineffective delivery channels 
Various but fragmented financial education programs have been carried out in the country by 
different institutions: i) Government led: Ministry of Education, Federal Cooperative Agency, 
Productive Safety Net Programs; ii) Non-for profit organizations led:  Such as CARE Ethiopia; 
and iii) Financial institutions led: such as Enat Bank, ACSI, AEMFI, EBA. However, many of 
these programs do not yet reach scale and their modules and delivery channels are inefficient, 
ineffective and not sustainable in certain ways. 
 
Consequently, they are unable to bring the required level of capability that helps to shape the 
financial behavior of the people, particularly in rural Ethiopia. These programs and modules 
need to be directed and coordinated to achieve the envisioned national financial education goals. 
The absence of sharing best and effective practices among the current providers of the financial 
educations has as well limits effective delivery and reaching the required level of scale at the 
national level. 
4.3. 
Unsustainable dissemination and rollout 
There is no clear policy, plan and procedure that direct the dissemination and rollout of financial 
education even for programs that are currently running by many stakeholders.  This has impacted 
negatively on the sustainability of many of the programs that have been started but unable to 
continue.   These are partly due to the absence of defining clear responsibility to all stakeholders 
who have vested interest on the financial education agenda of the country.  As leveraging on the 
existing financial programs that have been running in the country alone cannot help to fully ensure 
the achievement of the envisioned goals and outcomes, identifying new and potential human 
resources is critically essential to sustainably disseminate and rollout the financial education 
programs.   
   
Naturally, the financial education dissemination process requires rigorous efforts of various 
stakeholders, which in some cases would be difficult to uphold without allocating fund for the 
purpose.  The absence of Financial Education Fund (FEF) is, therefore, among the barriers to build 
tenable nationwide infrastructure and access centers to financial education. 
 
 
 
19 
 
As indicated under section 4.2, various fragmented financial education programs are being carried 
out in the country. Alignment of these programs with good practices that can leverage on well-
tested modules and materials delivered at teachable moments would highly help to advance the 
promotion of financial education in the country.  Moreover, designing financial education 
programs and modules need to take into consideration of the priority focus groups such as women 
and rural adults who are often lagging behind. 
4.4. 
Absence of coordination, monitoring and evaluation system 
There is no system to coordinate track, monitor and evaluate financial education initiatives, 
efforts, progresses and achievements of different stakeholders in the country. Consequently, it 
becomes impossible to gauge changes and impacts in financial education thus far and have created 
difficulty in making financial education programs sustainable. 
 
As highlighted under section 4.2, there are various financial education programs running in the 
country by different institutions. Some of these programs, however, are overlapping and 
duplicating efforts and some are not efficient and effective.  As a result, the required level of 
capability to shape and change the financial behavior of adults at the national level has not 
been progressing well.  Most of the adults, particularly in rural Ethiopia, are excluded from 
financial transactions due to lack of financial knowledge and skill. This has been shading its 
negative influence on the promotion of financial inclusion, making well-informed financial 
decisions by most adults, improving financial well-being and ultimately to alleviate poverty. 
 
To realize the required level of change and impact, reinforcing, coordinating and directing the 
financial education initiatives currently running in the country towards shared and common 
national goals would help to achieve the ultimate objectives. Addressing these overarching 
challenges is at the core of promoting financial education, increase financial literacy and bring   
capability that in particular help marginalized and low income people, the rural adults and 
women to change and shape their financial behavior and progressively enable them capable of 
making well-informed financial transactions that would eventually support the achievement of the 
financial inclusion targets set out in the NFIS. 
 
 
20 
 
5. NFES FRAMEWORK 
There was no study that identifies financial education target groups at national level. Most of the 
programs that have been running in the country particularly by NGOs are focusing on urban 
areas and some small cities which are limited in scope and hence not accessible to most of the 
adults in general and women in rural areas in particular. The Ethiopian capability survey in 
2017, however, evidenced that rural adults and women should and need to be given utmost priority 
and focus in financial education. 
Given the low levels of financial capability in Ethiopia and the importance of financial education 
and literacy in money management, account ownership and financial inclusion, the NBE is 
establishing this National Financial Education Strategy. 
 
5.1.NFES framework for action 
 
Progress towards financial education requires a framework to underpin the NFES. The proposed 
framework reflects the challenges and underlying issues identified and discussed in Section 3 
and 4. 
 
 
 
Figure 5.1: NFES Framework for Action 
 
 
 
21 
 
The NFES Framework for action calls for formulating and executing strategies to addressing the 
overarching challenges discussed under section 4.  For effective implementation, the strategies 
need to be grounded on and guided by clear purpose, vision, mission and objectives as assorted 
below: 
5.2.Rationale 
 
This NFES intends to provide a cogent framework which establishes priorities, promotes smoother 
and more sustainable cooperation between stakeholders, coordinates financial education initiatives 
to avoid duplication and recommends a monitoring and evaluation mechanism to ensure progress 
towards target goals. It also aims to further operationalize the National Financial Literacy Working 
Group and other aspects of the National Financial Education Strategy. 
 
The purpose of this National Financial Education Strategy is to provide a coherent, 
institutionally coordinated and focused approach to financial education delivery that will 
enhance the financial literacy levels and ultimately the financial capability of Ethiopians 
5.3.Mission 
The mission of the National Financial Education Strategy is: 
To improve and increase the financial literacy and capability of adults, households and 
enterprises through financial education, to enable them make informed financial 
decisions.   
5.4.Vision statement 
The core vision of the National Financial Education Strategy is: 
Ensure adults, households and enterprises in Ethiopia are capable of making well- 
informed financial decisions and ultimately improving their financial transaction well-
being by 2025. 
5.5.Objectives 
 
The identified objectives of the National Financial Education Strategy are to: 
 Build a sustainable financial education access infrastructure; 
 Design and implement effective education interventions modules to reach scale and 
identify sustainable delivery channels for financial education; 
 
 
22 
 
 Establish sustainable governance mechanisms by identifying a lead coordinator to steer 
and coordinate the effective effort of national financial education delivery; 
 Define specific roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder and propose a process by 
which stakeholders can maximize their use of available resources; 
 Provide guidance and support stakeholders to perform their roles and responsibilities 
through the development of a detailed implementation plan; and  
 Provide a structured monitoring and evaluation framework to track progress and ensure 
effective implementation of the NFES. 
 
5.6.Main Strategies 
Strategy 1: Build Robust National Financial Education Infrastructure 
To effectively implement the National Financial Education Strategy, relevant governance 
arrangements will need to be in place to provide for policy guidance and implementation 
oversight, coordinate stakeholders consultation and efforts, and monitor and evaluate the eventual 
impact of the strategy. These includes i) formulating a NFES; ii) formulating policy and 
procedure for financial education; iii) establishing a financial education executing unit in the 
proposed CPFED; iv) building a robust Financial Literacy Working Group; v) reinforcing on  the 
existing access points  and creating new ones; and vi) creating Financial Education Fund that help 
to run the programs sustainably. 
 
Strategy 2:   Design and Implement Impactful National Financial Education Programs, 
Modules and Channels 
This National Financial Education Strategy encourages enhancing efforts to reach marginalized   
populations left behind the current programs. According to the 2017 Financial Capability survey, 
rural and female Ethiopians are not yet adequately reached by financial education efforts or 
formal financial services more broadly and are lagging behind national financial inclusion and 
capability levels. Therefore, there is a clear need to prioritize and strengthen financial education 
initiatives and aggressively strategize to reach rural adults and women. Other target populations, 
such as low-income urban adults, children and youth, will continue to remain as key target groups. 
 
 
 
 
23 
 
For all programs, a thorough assessment of the target population and their needs is crucial to 
designing effective and impactful financial education programs, modules and channels that in 
turn facilitate implementation, tracking and corrective intervention measures in a timely manner. 
In addition, programs should be formulated and delivered in a such way that leverage teachable 
moments and good practices that have been proven to work globally, particularly in the context 
of already existing financial services available to the people.  This strategy calls for financial 
education programs to be specifically designed to bring impact which is backed by evidence. It is 
also important to note that programs should be designed within the context of key 
stakeholders/institutions mandate, and within the context of financial services that already exist 
within the lives of beneficiaries. Programs that are not within the reach of the already-existing 
programs or mandate, or that provide awareness or education around products and services that 
do not yet exist or fit for the target tend to be less successful as learned from good international 
practices.   
 
For the target groups, therefore, the necessary programs (women, rural adults, youth and 
children) and modules (saving, credit, insurance, pension, payment, budget etc) together with the 
appropriate delivery channels would be designed.   Guidelines that give direction to the providers 
will also be developed and periodically reviewed to ensure effective delivery of the programs 
ongoing basis. 
 
Strategy 3: 
Sustainable Dissemination and Rollout to Reach Scale 
Financial capability levels among Ethiopians will continue to remain limited if sustainable and 
effective programs are not disseminated and rollout to those that need it most. Many social and 
government programs are currently providing financial services to many beneficiaries or 
consumers, and these programs can be leveraged to provide education appropriately at scale. This 
can also include leveraging financial service providers to provide targeted financial education to 
new customers and marginalized populations as feasible. 
 
Therefore, formulating national financial education programs together with the necessary 
modules, delivery channels and setting suitable centers for the trainees help to build and bring the 
required level of financial capability to reach out scale. These should be supported and tasked 
 
 
24 
 
with clear plan for dissemination and rollout taking into consideration of each of the specific 
programs, modules and delivery channels. 
   
Strategy 4: Build and Implement Effective Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation System 
In Ethiopia, already there exist several financial education programs that have been successful, 
and the knowledge and materials within these programs can potentially be leveraged and 
customized by new stakeholders to further and better design impactful programs. Therefore, 
strong coordination across various financial education programs and related stakeholders will 
help to promote knowledge sharing that includes good practices, insights, materials and lessons 
learned that can be used by other providers.  
 
In view of the foregoing, coordination of stakeholders‟ commitment and cooperation will be 
critical to providing financial education that would bring impact and help to achieve the goals of 
the NFES. Stakeholders should commit to contributing to the NFES targets and goals by 
integrating financial education content, core messages or programs within their current activities 
and reporting progress over time. 
 
The processes of coordination, monitoring and evaluation require building an internal tracking 
system to identifying key stakeholders, registering their initiatives and targets track their 
progresses against standards that should be set out.  Moreover, this process helps to align the 
current active programs and initiatives with the national programs, modules and goals of the 
NFES. 
 
Overall, effective coordination across stakeholders and monitoring and evaluation will be key to 
helping ensure programs are aligned to national goals, scaling-up successful programs, sharing 
learning or good practices among key public and private stakeholders, and monitoring and 
reporting national progress over time.  To effectively carry out the monitoring and evaluation 
tasks of the financial education at the national level, among others, data infrastructure and 
tracking system will be designed and implemented. Rigorous testing and evaluation of programs 
prior to rollout will also be carried out ongoing basis.  (The full content of monitoring and 
evaluation system is discussed under Section 7).

5.7.    Financial education targets 
As part of Ethiopia‟s Financial Education Results Framework, high-level KPIs to monitor and 
evaluate financial education progress towards the achievement of the strategy has been 
established. The high-level financial education indicators and targets were designed to be 
achievable, but ambitious. The indicators were selected as being feasible to be collected and 
reported over time, and were informed by an analytic and consultative process. The indicators 
intend to both monitor and communicate overall progress towards policy objectives. 
 
Multiple stakeholders, financial service providers and government institutions with programs 
related to the provision of financial services or financial education can commit to their own 
institutional targets which contribute to national goals of the NFES.  The targets below will help 
to monitor the impact of financial education efforts on financial capability throughout the nation. 
 
The Financial Education National Results framework will also leverage the financial inclusion 
strategy indicators to monitor improvements in general financial inclusion, including access to 
loans, insurance and other financial services as well as activity of accounts. The framework will 
also leverage the NFIS supply-side data indicators to measure performance in the interim. Since 
financial capability plays a critical role in the uptake and usage of formal financial services, 
increases in financial inclusion can indicate both contributions from and improvements of 
financial capability at a national level. Although there is no clear way to separate the contribution 
of financial education to overall financial inclusion at a national level using supply-side data, 
supply-side statistics will still provide an overview of the progress of the financial sector.

b) Supply side targets 
The National Financial Education Strategy, through various efforts and effective stakeholder 
commitment, will aim to provide effective financial education to around 12 million adults 
with a view to bring the total to 49million19 adults by 2025. 
                                                          
 
16 To calculate the average score, the methodology includes taking the most known financial products and 
services (saving, credit, payment, insurance, pension etc..), and weighting each term as “1” and taking the 
percentage mean average of adults who report being able to understand each term. 
17 B a s e li n e : World Bank Financial Capability Survey 2017 is the latest demand side data, which is used as proxy to 
forecast 2025 targets 
18 Estimated based on demand side target set in the NFIS 
19 The target for supply side indicator is determined as 80% of 55% of adult population which is projected to 
be 112mln in 2025.

Although some questions could be raised on the quality and nature of the financial literacy training 
due to lack of consistency, standardization and focus, currently more than 35 million adults have 
received financial education and awareness in some form:  During account opening, in the course 
of using the account, though advertisements (advocacy) and general delivery of financial education 
by microfinance institutions, banks, self-initiated NGOs and Ministry of Education. This includes 
around 22 million members of cooperatives, 8 million PSNPs beneficiaries and around 17 million 
under adult education program of the Ministry of Education.   Considering a 20% overlapping on 
the trainings under all schemes, we consider at least 37million adults have received one or another 
form of financial education.  This serves as base line for 2020.  Over the course of the strategy 
period, therefore, it is envisioned to provide financial education for around 12 million adults.

6. COORDINATION AND INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS OF THE STRATEGY 
6.1.Linkages with NFIS governance structure 
To advance financial inclusion in Ethiopia, the NFIS called for the establishment of a multilevel 
structure comprised of relevant authorities and actors. The structure comprises of: 
a. The National Council for Financial Inclusion;   
b. The National Financial Inclusion Steering Committee; 
b.   The National Bank of Ethiopia; 
c.   The Financial Inclusion Secretariat (FIS) – housed at the National Bank of Ethiopia; and 
d.   coordinators, including   a „Consumer   Protection   and   Financial   Education 
Coordinator‟.  
 
This strategy will leverage existing NFIS structures to the extent possible. 
 
6.2.Policy guidance and implementation oversight 
The National Council for Financial Inclusion, which provides overall policy guidance relevant to 
the National Financial Inclusion Strategy, will be leveraged for the National Financial Education 
Strategy to help ensure that financial education remains a key policy priority in respective 
instructions, as per the financial inclusion strategy. In addition, the steering committee will also 
help oversee the implementation of the National Financial Education Strategy, receive regular 
updates and provide guidance and oversight to course correct as needed. 
6.3. Stakeholders coordination and consultation 
The Consumer Protection and Financial Education Working Group, established after the launch of 
the NFIS, will be leveraged to serve as a consultation and implementation forum for the Financial 
Education Strategy efforts. New members of the working group should be introduced and include 
decision-makers from a wide range of institutions, including stakeholders from the public, 
private and civil society sectors. Since a range of government entities and private sector 
players deliver financial education, these stakeholders are critical to be included within the 
working group to enhance financial education efforts. In addition, stakeholders from civil societies 
that currently conducting large-scale financial education efforts should be represented in the 
Working Group as well to support new efforts and share their experiences and success. 
 
 
29 
 
The Working Group should be fluid in nature such that it can assign tasks to its members for 
implementation and can sometimes form sub-groups or task forces to implement the financial 
education agenda accordingly. 
6.4.Consumer Protection and Financial Education Directorate (CPFED)  
This strategy calls for the establishment of a dedicated CPFED. The Directorate should be 
comprised of three teams: (i) Financial Consumer Protection Regulation and Supervision Team; ii) 
Compliant Handling Team; and (iii) Financial Education Team. 
Integrating the actions of these teams under one directorate help to leverage and complement to the 
efficient and effective execution that would eventually lead scale of operation and to the 
achievement of the targets set out in this strategy and the overarching goal of the NFIS.  
 
Consumer Protection and Financial Education Directorate together with the working group should 
be responsible for ensuring the implementation of the NFES. To do so, the Working Group should 
convene at least quarterly, and, under its mandate, should: 
i.         help finalize the NFES; 
ii. 
provide input into the selection and development of NFES actions over time; 
iii.       help develop granular action plans and roadmaps to achieve the ultimate goal; and 
iv. 
coordinate with the NBE on the implementation of actions assigned to each member 
and lead institutions as needed. 
 
The Financial Consumer Protection Regulation and Supervision Team, Compliant Handling Team 
and Financial Education Team would be structured, as stated herein below (Figure 6.1), under the 
proposed CPFED and leverage and complement each other to provide for the day-to-day 
administrative, coordination, and M&E functions to support the implementation of the National 
Financial Education Strategy. The Financial Education staff of the team should include: 
i. 
Principal Financial Education Coordinator who will lead the financial 
education agenda and the execution of the NFES;  
 
ii. 
Senior 1 and Senior 2 Financial Education Specialists who will support 
technically the activities of the unit, help to prepare recommendations for the 
 
 
30 
 
Working Group, coordinate across stakeholders to enable mutual support and 
learning, and provide technical support to relevant stakeholders to develop and 
implement new programs or improve / scale up existing initiatives. In addition, 
specialists should consistently keep track of new trends, research, and maintain a 
registry or stock-taking of key programs in Ethiopia, along with their reach and 
impact; 
 
iii. 
Monitoring and evaluation specialist who will track financial education progress 
at 3 levels: (i) the action level to monitor progress in the implementation of 
financial education programs; (ii) the outcome level to evaluate the success of 
financial education programs; and (iii) the national level to measure national 
progress (often through surveys) of the financial literacy framework and strategy. 
To do so, the M&E coordinator will also provide support to relevant working group 
members to integrate key indicators and M&E frameworks to track basic financial 
education information at a programmatic level. 
 
iv.  
Administrative staff to support the work of the Financial Education specialists 
under the leadership of the Director of the CPFED. 
 
The staff of the Financial Education Team should work closely with FIS. Once established, the 
Financial Education Team should focus on the technical aspects of implementing the National 
Financial Education Strategy. The Directorate also should lead the coordination, communication 
and convening efforts (particularly with the Working Group) in the context of the NFIS, and act as 
the intermediary between the Directorate and the FIS, including reporting the progresses. 
 
Until such time of establishing a dedicated directorate to lead, coordinate and implement the 
foregoing actions in a more planned and focused manner, financial education, financial consumers 
protection and complaint handing affairs will be carried out by respective supervision directorates 
of the National Bank of Ethiopia.  The possible future structure of the directorate is also indicated 
in figure 6.1 herein below.   
 
 
31 
 
6.5. The financial inclusion secretariat 
The Financial Inclusion Secretariat, which is mandated to provide day-to-day administrative, 
coordination and M&E functions for the National Financial Inclusion Strategy, will work in 
coordination with the CPFED to monitor the efforts of the National Financial Education Strategy 
and report progress to the Financial Inclusion Steering Committee, as per the governance 
arrangements stated within the NFIS. 
 
Until the Consumer Protection and Financial Education Directorate is established and operational, 
the Financial Inclusion Secretariat should assume the convening functions of coordinating, 
monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the Financial Education Strategy in the interim. 
6.6.Reporting and communicating progress  
The Consumer Protection and Financial Education Directorate will provide quarterly and ad hoc 
reports to FIS, as well as to the Financial Literacy Working Group. The Financial Inclusion 
Secretariat will be responsible for updating the Financial Inclusion Steering Committee on all 
progress with NFES implementation as it relates to the Financial Inclusion Strategy. In order to 
provide additional information and awareness on financial products and services and to report the 
progress of financial education efforts to the general public, detailed communication strategies will 
be formulated and made part of the monitoring and evaluation framework of CPFED.

6.7.Funding 
A flexible approach to funding sources should be considered to fund selected financial education 
actions. Together with the Financial Literacy Working Group, the Financial Education Team of the 
CPFED should help gain consensus on which funding model to utilize for its activities. Depending 
on the actions adopted, NBE may consider various funding options and approaches to support the 
implementation of the National Financial Education Strategy actions including, but not limited to: 
 Self-funding: A lead organization funds its own financial education program(s) if it is 
under its mandate; 
 
A private sector players might pay for a program from its own internal 
resources; 
 
A public agency or ministry might pay for a program through a budget line 
item or the reallocation of budgeted funds20; 
 
 Donors funding: There are several donors that may be interested in supporting 
financial education activities in Ethiopia. Once the planned, donor round-table for 
Financial Inclusion is established and operational, the group can be leveraged to fund 
selected financial education activities; 
 
 Pooled funding: A group of organizations pool funds to fund a program.  
Funds 
might come from a combination of private, public, and civil society 
organizations to fund the efforts of one or more organizations. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                          
 
20 One caveat regarding this source is that delays in the approval of an organization‟s budget can result in 
delays in the implementation of a new public program

7. MONITORING AND EVALUTAION (M&E) 
An effective NFES requires a robust and well-planned M&E framework to enable stakeholders 
to track progress, identify bottlenecks and measure impact on overall and priority populations. The 
M&E framework is designed to track progress against the objectives, activities and outputs 
outlined in the action plan to enable informed decisions on whether resources are being utilized 
effectively. 
The measurement of progress towards financial education objectives set out by this Financial 
Education Strategy requires a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system that is well-resourced, 
well-coordinated and accepted among the NFIS governance arrangements and related stakeholders. 
The Financial Education M&E system will comprise of four elements: 
 Data infrastructure which provides relevant and reliable financial education data to 
comprehensively assess financial education reach and growth in financial 
capability over time. 
 A Financial Education results framework that establishes key targets aligned with 
the policy objectives of the NFES for tracking; 
 Action plan tracking system and reporting mechanisms that track the execution and 
outcomes of actions of the strategy to ensure that implementation is on track; and 
 Support the rigorous testing and evaluation of financial education actions and 
programs to ensure the efficiency, effectiveness, and impact of financial education 
actions. 
7.1.Data infrastructure 
To measure progress of the financial education strategy and related actions, the Financial 
Education Team will be tasked with ensuring the following types of data are available as it 
pertains to the Financial Education Strategy: 
 
Demand-side data to measure and report on the Financial Education Results 
Framework. The Financial Education Team may need to integrate key financial 
education and capability indicators into the Ethiopian Socio-Economic household 
survey periodically carried out by the Central Statistics Agency; 
 
 
 
35 
 
 
Supply-side data, including high-level KPIs or national goals and targets, 
collected by the NBE originally from providers of financial services and financial 
education programs to understand potential impacts of enhanced financial 
educational efforts; 
 
 
Action-level data collected by programs relevant to financial education 
actions to monitor and track the progress and reach of financial education efforts 
in Ethiopia. 
7.2.Financial education results framework21 
The Financial Education National Results framework will also leverage the financial inclusion 
strategy indicators to monitor improvements in general financial inclusion, including access to 
loans, insurance and other financial services as well as activity of accounts. The framework will 
also leverage the NFIS supply-side data indicators to measure performance in the interim. Since 
financial capability plays a critical role in the uptake and usage of formal financial services, 
increases in financial inclusion can indicate both contributions from and improvements of financial 
capability at a national level. Although there is no clear way to separate the contribution of 
financial education to the overall financial inclusion at a national level using supply-side data, 
supply-side statistics will still provide an overview of the progress of the financial sector. 
7.3.Action plan tracking system 
The Financial Education Team will be tasked with developing (in coordination with Financial 
Literacy Working Group members) steps to appropriately monitor action plans and their progress, 
which can also be used as Key Performance Indicators. As far as possible, the Financial Education 
Team should be responsible to put in place a log frame that clearly lays out how the action and 
program intends to generate outputs that will in turn yield program outcomes. Such outputs and 
outcomes, which should be reported by implementing institutions or the working groups themselves, 
can be leveraged as performance indicators to measure progress of the Financial Education strategy. 
                                                          
 
21 Ethiopia‟s Financial Education results framework establishes high-level KPIs to monitor financial education 
progress towards the achievement of the strategy. The high-level financial education indicators and targets were 
designed to be achievable, but ambitious. The indicators were selected as being feasible to be collected and reported 
over time, and were informed by an analytic and consultative process.  The indicators intend to both monitor and 
communicate overall progress towards policy objectives. 
 
 
 
36 
 
The Financial Education Team will be mandated to develop, maintain and track progress of financial 
education actions and related programs, and monitor a set of outputs and outcomes to ensure that 
implementation of financial education actions is on track. 
7.4.Rigorous testing and evaluation 
There is a need for a more coordinated approach to rigorously test and evaluate financial education 
programs prior to national rollout. The Financial Education Team can support and encourage 
efforts for financial education programs to effectively monitor and evaluate the reach, efficacy and 
impact of ongoing programs. In addition, the Team can help coordinate and oversee the integration 
of rigorous testing or evaluations within financial education programs to assess their impact, share 
insights and scale up resources for effective financial education programs more efficiently. 
7.5.Reviews 
A mid-term review of NFES implementation, based on action plan progress and progress towards 
headline targets, should be conducted at the end of 2023 to take stock of progress and identify 
new challenges and opportunities associated with the action plan. Based on findings from the 
review, the NFES will be reassessed to identify new action items or corrective measures through a 
consultative process. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
37 
 
8. PRIORITY ACTIONS 
The National Financial Education Strategy should be a living document that prioritizes only a 
few actions at a time and includes flexibility for reassessment to periodically identify new 
actions and next steps. The rationale behind this method is based on a need to consistently (i) focus 
efforts on a few, core, impactful actions; (ii) continuously align efforts to international good 
practices; and (iii) continuously refocus actions and priorities over time, based on the needs of an 
evolving market. Therefore, the strategy should allow for a mid-term review based on which 
implementation of the strategy will be reviewed to refocus efforts and ensure its relevance. 
 
The NFES prioritizes as assorted under Annex 1, based on the NFES Framework for Action, which 
should be implemented with core financial education good principles in mind (see Annex 6). The 
actions aim to first develop institutional capacity and infrastructure to spearhead the 
implementation of the NFES, then to build and integrate effective financial education initiatives 
into core national efforts.  Detailed implementation plans should be facilitated by the CPFED and 
developed with the Financial Literacy Working Group.

Recommendations 
Description 
Foundation 1: Build Robust Institutional Arrangements for Financial Education 
1 
Build a Robust Financial 
Literacy Working Group 
Many public and private stakeholders are either planning to or 
are already implementing financial education programs. 
These stakeholders should be identified and invited to join the 
Financial Literacy working group to coordinate, share 
experiences and lessons learned, and act as a consultative 
platform to design and integrate new initiatives. 
 
The Working Group will meet quarterly with the aim to drive 
the financial literacy agenda forward, foster strategic 
partnerships, create synergies, review and generate new action 
items, and share insights and lessons learned. 
 
A range of stakeholders from both the public and private 
sectors should become members of the working group, and 
more stakeholders should be added over time. In the short 
term this strategy recommends including: (i) the FCA (to 
support efforts to include financial education as a core activity 
of their Cooperative Extension Agents); (ii) Commercial 
Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) (iii) Care Ethiopia; (iv) ENAT Bank; 
(v) PEACE MFI; (vi) Ethiopia ACSI; (vii) Kifiya; (viii) 
Agricultural Transformation Agency; (ix) the Association of 
Ethiopian Microfinance Institutions (AEMFI); and (x) the 
Ethiopian Bankers Association; among others. Additional 
stakeholders should be brought in to specific work streams as 
needed from industry and professional associations, for 
instance including the Legal Association, Accounting 
Association, and Insolvency Practitioners for financial 
awareness and capability raising around collateral registries 
and credit bureaus. 
2 
Establish a Consumer 
Protection and Financial 
Education  Directorate 
with 
Financial 
Education 
Team 
to 
coordinate 
sector-wide 
financial 
education 
efforts 
A Consumer Protection and Financial Education Directorate 
should be established by the NBE with a mandate to ensure 
that products and services are delivered and used by 
Ethiopian consumers in a responsible manner. The CPFED 
should consist of three teams: a (i) Financial Consumer 
Protection Regulation and Supervision Team; ii) Compliant 
Handling Team; and (iii) a Financial Education Team. 
 
Given the mandate of the CPFED, housing the Financial 
Education Team within a CPFED will offer a comparative 
advantage in linking and coordinating with relevant 
stakeholders involved with the roll-out of consumer 
protections around existing and new financial products and

services. 
 
This NFES prioritizes allocation of staff within the Financial 
Education Team of the CPFED to coordinate and execute the 
strategy as well as monitor, evaluate and report the impact of 
related NFES actions. 
 
Foundation 2: Stakeholder Commitment 
3 
Establish and implement 
the NFES M&E system 
M&E framework designed specifically to monitor and 
evaluate financial education programs should be implemented 
by the Financial Education Team.  The M&E framework 
should (i) detail an approach and methodology to consolidate 
financial education programs in Ethiopia and appropriately 
monitor their efforts. This may include requesting key 
financial education indicators from relevant programs to 
better track reach and impact of current efforts; (ii) evaluate 
national level financial literacy progress through core demand 
and supply side indicators; (iii) develop a coherent reporting 
system to disseminate progress and identify bottlenecks; and 
(iv) track NFES action progress over time. National level 
indicators should be added to existing surveys like the CSA‟s 
Ethiopia Socio-Economic survey for periodic tracking. 
4 
Define 
a 
national 
commitment 
for 
stakeholders 
for 
financial 
education 
provision 
A National commitment or Goal should be defined by the 
Financial Literacy Working group which places a numerical, 
national target on the number of adults to be reached within 
financial education. Various implementing stakeholders can 
contribute to this national goal as feasible and report progress 
over time. 
Foundation 3: Knowledge Sharing 
5 
Leverage 
existing 
knowledge and share 
lessons learned 
Once established, the Financial Education Team, with support 
of the Financial Literacy Working Group and related 
stakeholders, should become a point of contact within the 
NBE for coordinating financial education in Ethiopia. 
 
This   effort   may   include   developing   a   mechanism (like   
a registration process) whereby NFES stakeholders can sign-
up to receive or contribute insights, lessons learned, or 
relevant tools and materials, thereby helping to better align 
programs and stakeholders to good practice. This effort can 
also be linked to monitoring the reach of current financial 
education programs. 
Cross-Cutting Pillars: Reach scale with impactful designed programs with focus on 
women and rural adults

Coordinate 
with 
the 
Ministry of Education to 
The Ministry of Education is currently working to revise its 
school curriculum. Currently, the Ministry of Education

Recommendations 
Description 
revise 
the 
financial 
education module(s) in 
the school curriculum 
includes a Financial Education Team in the Civics and 
Ethical Education curriculum for grade 5 to 12. This NFES 
can work to broaden and revise the curriculum, and align it to 
good practice, so that students can cover a broader range of 
topics, like digital financial services and emphasize on 
practical skills with examples tailored to the Ethiopian 
context. Teachers can also receive training so they have the 
knowledge, skills and confidence to provide effective 
financial education to their students. 
 
This action should be implemented in close coordination 
with the Financial Literacy working group to leverage 
existing financial education materials, draw from lessons 
learned and offer a platform for consultation. Stakeholders 
and NGOs that have already developed curriculum and 
implemented programs can help tailor and make relevant the 
curricula for students, based on lessons learned from their 
own programs 
 
The Financial Literacy Working Group should also assess 
opportunities to provide financial education within university 
curricula and as extra-curricular as well. This may also 
include law and accounting schools for secured transactions 
or insolvency 
 
7 
Support 
the 
Federal 
Cooperative 
Agency 
(FCA) 
in 
enhancing 
their 
Financial 
Education programs 
The FCA is currently expanding its cooperative extension 
agent network within Ethiopia to provide financial education 
to SACCO groups. Providing additional financial education to 
households within Kebeles is also within their mandate 
 
Through this strategy, the NBE and Financial Literacy 
Working Group should work to help strengthen the FCA 
financial education program, delivered   by   Cooperative   
Development   Agents   to Kebele-level communities. 
Knowledge sharing with Financial Literacy   Working   
Group   members   and   leveraging   existing, relevant 
materials may help to re-vamp training and learning manuals, 
particularly for PSNP Kebeles. 
 
The FCA may want to leverage the Financial Literacy 
Working Group to develop and integrate digital literacy 
modules as well, particularly for PSNP Kebeles, as many 
PSNP beneficiaries receive disbursements through mobile 
wallets but without the relevant digital literacy skills

Develop 
financial 
education guidelines for 
financial providers 
Guidelines and related tools like „Frequently Asked Question‟ 
sheets (FAQs) can be developed and issued to financial 
service providers to encourage and direct them on how to 
provide basic financial education and core messages to 
consumers at teachable- moments (like at the point of account 
opening, particularly for low-income or first-time consumers) 
 
Guidelines for providers, as well as recommendations around 
education issues, core messages and relevant financial 
education tools, can be developed and customized per sector 
including for banks, microfinance institutions and SACCOs. 
 
Such 
guidelines 
will 
help 
ensure 
customers 
fully 
understanding basic concepts around their financial product or 
service (particularly loans), as well as their consumer rights 
and the range of other product offerings available to them. 
These efforts would be particularly impactful if adopted by 
the CBE, given the wide- reach of CBE branches. 
9 
Improve 
awareness 
around 
new 
credit 
infrastructures law and 
systems operation 
Ethiopia has recently established new credit infrastructures 
serving 
consumers, 
small 
businesses, 
and 
financial 
institutions. Awareness campaigns, capacity building as well 
as targeted integration of curriculum in technical schools (like 
law schools and accounting schools) should be implemented 
to raise awareness and capability for consumers, financial 
institutions 
and 
related 
stakeholders 
around 
credit 
infrastructure (in particular for credit reporting, secured 
transactions, 
the 
collateral 
registry 
and 
insolvency). 
Awareness   campaigns   and   capacity   building   should   
target potential consumers, firms, financial institutions and 
other related stakeholders (i.e judiciary) and include 
delivering communications through various media outlets22 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                          
 
22 The WBG will support the NBE around these activities by hiring a communications firm to implement such 
activities before December 2019; any materials developed by the communications firm in this time period may be 
rolled out by the NBE and Working Group after the contract with the communications firm has ended.

Annex 4: Target Group Profiles 
The NFES acknowledges that the opportunities and related actions to improve financial education 
will vary across different segments of the population. Given evidence from the 2017 World Bank 
Financial Capability Survey and consensus among NFES implementing stakeholders, the NFES 
prioritizes women and rural Ethiopians as target populations for which improved levels of 
financial capability is critical. 
 
The following table summarizes the baseline status of awareness, access and literacy, which are 
basic components that make up the financial capability of individuals, across key Ethiopian 
consumer segments. It also lays out the opportunities for financial education and the most effective 
delivery channels based on findings from the 2017 World Bank Financial Capability Survey

Profile: 
While most urban females 
can 
handle 
financial 
calculations like division, 
they still lag behind more 
complicated concepts like 
simple 
interest 
(23

Learning Preferences: 
Almost all urban women indicate wanting to learn more about financial products and 
services (86 percent). The majority report getting their information by watching 
television (80 percent) and through mobile phones (84 percent), which corroborates 
with urban women reporting their preferred channels for learning through TV 
advertisements (31 percent), mobile phone (19 percent) and local government offices 
like kebele officials (12 percent). Hence, channels such as the television, mobile 
phones and local government should be leveraged to implement financial 
education/capability initiatives on increasing usage of digital delivery channels, 
product features and financial planning among urban women.

women (64 percent) 
report 
not 
enough 
money as the main 
barrier 
to 
account 
ownership. 73 percent 
of rural women report 
not knowing how to 
open an account – this 
is the highest among 
the 
consumer 
segments described in 
this table. 
Opportunity: 
Rural women should be a 
priority segment given low 
take-up of formal financial 
products. Only 34 percent 
considered alternatives before 
purchasing a financial product. 
Hence, efforts through large 
scale government programs 
like PSNP to improve learning 
around consumer protection 
and product features, should 
be considered. 
Opportunity: 
This segment needs to 
be drawn into the 
formal financial sector 
through 
learning 
focused 
on 
product 
types 
and 
requirements, 
given 
that 
rural 
women 
report having informal 
savings 
but 
also 
perceive 
that 
they 
don‟t 
have 
enough 
money to open a bank 
account. 
 
Initiatives to increase 
physical network of 
access points in rural 
areas will be key 
improving 
account 
ownership 
among 
rural women. 
Opportunity: 
Financial

addition 
to 
practical 
financial 
concepts 
(like 
interest rate calculations) 
and their connection to 
financial products (personal 
bank agriculture loans) that 
could be used by rural 
women to reach their goals. 
Learning Preferences: 
Similar to urban women, 84 percent of rural Ethiopian women want to learn more 
about financial products and officials. The preferred source of learning is through 
local government like kebele officials and most get their information through their 
community leader (71 percent) or by listening to the radio (49 percent). These

delivery channels, particularly through local kebele official, financial education

be leveraged while implementing financial education programs for rural women. 
Urban 
Male 
Profile: 
Over 90 percent of urban 
Ethiopian men have heard 
about financial products and 
services offered by public and 
private 
commercial 
banks. 
More than 70 percent are 
aware of ATMs and money 
transfer 
services, 
and 
69 
percent have heard of mobile 
money agents which are the 
highest among the consumer 
segments described in this 
table. 
Profile: 
This segment displays 
the highest level of 
financial access and 
capability. 68 percent 
of urban males are 
banked 
and 
the 
majority 
have 
an 
account with a public 
commercial bank like 
Commercial Bank of 
Ethiopia 
(CBE). 
While it is higher than 
urban women, only 7 
percent have a mobile 
money account. The 
most 
common 
financial 
product 
among urban males is 
a transaction/savings 
account (67 percent). 
Despite 
reasonably 
high levels of account 
ownership 
among 
urban 
males, 
53 
percent report using 
informal 
insurance 
(iddir) and 32 percent 
report 
having 
an 
informal 
saving 
product like Equb or 
with self-help groups. 
Profile: 
Most urban males can 
handle basic financial 
concepts like division 
(91 percent), inflation 
(60 
percent) 
and 
discounting (57 percent). 
Similar 
to 
other 
segments, understanding 
of 
interest 
rate 
calculations is still low 
(36 percent – simple 
interest, 18 percent – 
compound interest). In 
terms of planning, 62 
percent exactly plan how 
their money will be spent 
but 44 percent stick to their 
plan. 
Given reasonably high levels 
of 
awareness 
of 
financial 
products and services among 
urban males, focus should be 
on increasing usage. Urban 
males may also need to 
enhance their understanding of 
consumer

Learning Preferences: 
Preferences for learning about financial products and services are mostly divided 
across learning from agents sent by financial service providers (25 percent), mobile 
phones (20 percent) and TV shows or advertisements (22 percent). Financial 
programs should leverage these channels while implementing initiatives around 
increased usage, awareness of second-tier products and consumer rights. Training on 
budgeting and debt management, or product features might be most effective when 
delivered at a bank branch or through an agent sent by the bank. 
Rural

organizations. 
Awareness of digital financial 
products and services among 
this segment is very low. Less

Youth 
Profile: 
Most youth are familiar with 
basic 
financial 
services 
provided at a public (83 
percent) or private commercial

Learning Preferences: 
Ethiopian youth seem to most prefer learning from agents of financial service 
providers who are sent to their community (31 percent) and tend to get their 
information from their community leader (61 percent) or by listening to the radio (64 
percent). Hence, efforts to increase financial capability of youth should be delivered 
through channels such as agents from financial service providers, messages from their 
local kebele officials or trainings at the kebele center and perhaps financial education 
campaigns or programs delivered through the radio. Delivery of financial education 
should be timed around key life-cycle events such as entering the work-force or 
starting higher education to equip youth with effective and responsible financial 
management at a young age.

Annex 5: SWOT Analysis 
A SWOT analysis is a useful and widely used tool for understanding the Strengths and 
Weaknesses of an initiative, and for identifying the Opportunities and Threats to a particularly 
objective. In this case, the below SWOT analysis identifies strengths, weaknesses opportunities 
and threats on the implementation of Ethiopia‟s National Financial Education Strategy towards 
the achievement of financial inclusion in Ethiopia. 
 
 
Annex 6: Good Principles to Consider for Financial Education in Ethiopia 
Improving financial capability of Ethiopians means developing an effective financial education 
ecosystem where adults receive education during teachable moments and that is relevant and 
contextualized to their lives. There are many objectives of financial education programs, but a 
core objective should be to help provide adults the necessary resources and skills to manage 
money and navigate the financial sector and related products and services effectively and 
responsibly, with full understanding of their consumer rights. To develop this ecosystem, 
different institutions and stakeholders, including financial institutions, should be able to deliver 
financial education in a way that is efficient and within their core mandate. One pitfall of 
financial education efforts in some countries include grand campaigns or events which often are 
time and resource intensive, but don‟t generate impactful change. Oftentimes workshops or 
lecture-based seminars in villages and schools, particularly by financial institutions, have not 
been shown to be effective. Ensuring that financial education efforts in Ethiopia are impactful 
means integrating good practices for financial education within the design and delivery of 
financial education programs and efforts. In addition, understanding efforts that are ineffective 
from other country experiences (or through impact evaluations) is also critical for identifying an 
appropriate strategy to improve the sector efficiently.  
 
Designing and Delivering Effective Financial Education Programs23 
The following tips should be taken into consideration by all parties to improve the effectiveness 
and impact of financial capability programs and activities in Ethiopia: 
 Financial education efforts should stay within the core mandate of an institution. 
 Financial education should be delivered at “teachable moments”, and within the context 
financial services actually available to individuals. For instance, awareness and education on 
mobile banking may not be relevant for rural adults that do not often use mobile phones or 
have access to an agent. Education should be provided when relevant context is available to 
consumers. Using teachable moments (i.e. a time when an individual is about to make an 
important financial decision or use a financial service, such as making a deposit into a 
savings account or receiving a loan disbursement) for financial education helps receivers 
retain their knowledge and newly acquired financial tools and behaviors. Teachable moments 
often occur around critical life events24, like receiving a cash transfer from the government or 
taking out a loan. Such timings can be leveraged to provide financial capability, since 
individuals during those moments are more likely to be receptive to new information and

adopt behavioral changes as part of their financial service. Leveraging “teachable moments” 
is an effective strategy to connect real-life decision making together with financial education 
and helps to ensure that information is more likely to be retained, used and can influence 
cash management behaviors25 
 
 
 Extra educational efforts should be provided to first-time users (and even low-income / 
less-educated consumers) of financial services, particularly for digital financial services 
where risks are often higher than traditional financial services.  
 
 A variety of channels and delivery mechanisms should be used for financial capability 
programs, including both face-to-face training programs and non-traditional channels that 
leverage technology, mass media, or behavioral interventions, such as nudges, reminders, 
and choice architecture. 
 
 The delivery channels for, and content of, financial capability programs should be client-
focused and reflect the demographics, cultural and financial context, and learning needs 
and preferences of the target population. 
 
 Financial capability programs should be cost-effective and make optimal use of 
resources. 
 
 Financial capability programs should be designed not only to increase recipients' 
knowledge, but also to enable them to develop and practice their skills, to instill 
responsible attitudes, and, most important, to promote financially capable behaviors. 
 
 So far as possible, financial capability initiatives should be fun, entertaining, and 
interactive and use simple messages that will resonate with the target audience. Where 
practical, they should involve “learning by doing.” 
 
 Financial capability messages should provide objective advice and should not be used as 
marketing initiatives for financial products or services. 
 
 Financial capability messages should be repeated and reinforced over time, as one-off 
interventions are unlikely to be successful.

 So far as practicable, financial capability programs should build on successful programs 
already being undertaken in a country and leverage insights from the existing evidence 
base of effective financial capability programs in other countries. 
 
Strengthening the Financial Education of Women26 
Women often face different constraints than men with respect to accessing financial products and 
services. Specifically, women tend to face different constraints and responsibilities related to 
education, skills, mobility, household work and child care, which can impact their ability to take 
advantage of financial education programs. Therefore, when designing financial education 
programs these gendered constraints should be considered to ensure women can receive targeted 
education that suits their educational needs and delivery preferences. The development of 
gender-sensitive, localized and culturally-appropriate financial education should be a major 
consideration. It is critical to ensure that, when designing the program, stakeholder consultations 
include both female and male representatives and women are properly consulted to understand 
and ensure their perspectives are integrated into program design. The following tips should be 
considered when developing financial education programs to better reach and suit the needs of 
women: 
 Programs should develop gender-sensitive strategies for education delivery, and educators 
should have a grasp of gender-sensitive approaches to facilitation; 
 
 Educators should always work to encourage equal participation in sessions that involve both 
male and female beneficiaries; 
 
 Programs should dedicate resources to hire female educators or staff members, especially to 
help facilitate activities and sessions that may be separated by gender; 
 
 Including training options for women to receive education and training in female-only, 
gender disaggregated environments is helpful in enabling women to feel more comfortable 
and open when discussing thoughts on financial topics; 
 
 If feasible, including house visits as training options for women will help to include women 
who may otherwise have difficulty traveling; 
 
 Working with women to identify optimum timings for trainings will help ensure the timings 
are relevant to their schedule, as the timings and workload of women differ from those of 
men;

 Avoiding reference to gendered behaviors in content and trainings is crucial, as otherwise it 
may reinforce stereotypes and inhibit conversation. In addition, content should advocate for 
and include scenarios where women take active roles in financial management and decision 
making. 
 
Enhancing Digital Financial Literacy27 
Electronic payment instruments or mobile money platforms are quickly becoming a means to 
reach financially excluded populations. Such success stories are evident in east Africa, with the 
rise of M-Pesa products in Kenya and Tanzania. However, an e-payment platform can often be a 
previously underserved adult‟s first exposure to the formal financial system and its various 
digital delivery channels. Many adults often face barriers28 to accessing and using their account, 
which should be addressed through the delivery of tailored digital financial education.  
 
For adults using a digital transaction account for the first time, receiving financial education 
through the same platform and using a digital financial education delivery mechanism may 
holistically strengthen their familiarity with digital tools.  
 
Typical modules that will need to be considered when trying to enhance the digital literacy of a 
population, particularly in the wake of digital savings or transaction schemes, include building 
skills to use electronic payment instruments, raising awareness and knowledge of digital delivery 
mechanisms (like ATMs, mobile money, card-based services, POS machines, agent networks, 
etc.), and PIN literacy. Modules may be considered for all types of electronic payment methods 
(mobile, card or agent based) and should include: (i) Opening and filling an e-payment account; 
(ii) Receiving electronic transfers; (iii) Using and spending e-payments (particularly mobile 
money if applicable); (iv) Accumulating and saving e-payment funds; (v) Utilizing additional 
financial service offerings; (vi) Managing cash transfer funds and avoiding mistakes and fraud; 
(vii) Whom, how and where to complain for e-payment issues. 
 
Leverage existing, tested materials for delivering financial education  
Ethiopia currently has an eco-system that can produce materials in a variety of media to enable 
programs to deliver engaging content, exercises, and tools that should result in changes in the 
behavior of the learners they engage. Many organizations that have already developed and tested

27 Common barriers to digital access and usage of accounts includes (i) a lack of knowledge of the services available; (ii) low 
numeracy levels; (iii) little understanding of the financial infrastructure; (iv) discomfort with the concept of e-payments, 
especially mobile money; and (v) low confidence pertaining to the use of e-payments, particularly for women.

a wide range of financial education content and materials can be further leveraged. These 
resources should be collected, compiled and consolidated for other organizations and institutions 
to leverage off successful materials.  
 
Monitoring National Financial Education Reach 
A national strategy and coordination unit can help develop key performance indicators to track 
the progress of financial education programs and measure the direct and indirect impact of 
financial education efforts. Prior to program implementation, guidance can be provided to key 
stakeholders to establish key financial capability targets and key performance indicators (KPIs), 
and relevant tools can be circulated to program staff on how to collect data. Many of these 
indicators can be predefined and standardized to try to aggregate across various programs to be 
able to assess progress at the provincial and national levels. Defining KPIs and targets ahead of 
implementation will provide structure for assessing progress and effective rollout and should be 
aligned with a programmatic theory of change.

Annex 7: Financial Education Mapping Exercise 
A mapping of financial education programs in Ethiopia was conducted to inform development of 
the National Financial Education Strategy in June 2016. The exercise intended to map recent or 
ongoing initiatives to understand their reach and impact. Although not exhaustive, Annex 8 
provides a summary of financial education initiatives conducted over time. 
 
The most common financial education content focused on savings mobilization, specifically 
using formal accounts at a bank, MFI, SACCO or RuSACCO to save, followed by debt 
management and budgeting. Overall content of financial education programs in Ethiopia 
conformed to international standards in terms of clarity of presentation, logical structure and 
limited reliance on text to convey messages25. However, the mapping exercise is limited and 
only provides a general overview of programs in Ethiopia that incorporate different approaches. 
 
A wide range of channels are used to deliver programs to their target populations that make up a 
variety of audiences: children, youth, women, PSNP beneficiaries, farmers, etc. These efforts are 
typically grounded in different business models with varying end goals. Donor-led/voluntary 
initiatives, which are most common in Ethiopia, aim to provide financial education out of 
a genuine interest to improve financial capability of the Ethiopian population. For financial 
sector programs, a positive business case in creating a potential market for future products and 
services motivates efforts to further financial education. Government led efforts are primarily a 
result of a legal mandate that aims to improve financial capability of a target population. These 
motivations often overlap and have different implications on how financial education programs 
are operationalized.

Annex 11: Experiences on development and implementation of financial education strategy 
Singapore 
MoneySENSE is the national financial education programme in Singapore. 
It is spearheaded by the Financial Education Steering Committee (FESC). The Monetary 
Authority of Singapore chairs the FESC, which comprises representatives from several public 
sector agencies and government ministries, including the Ministry of Education, Ministry of 
Health, Ministry of Manpower, Ministry of Social and Family Development, Central Provident 
Fund Board, National Library Board and People‟s Association. (OECD/INFE Policy Handbook, 
2015, page 90)

Co-operation among the private sector, central bank and Ministry of Education paving the 
way to mandatory financial education. 
 
Beginning in 2017, financial education will be implemented progressively into the secondary 
school curriculum in mathematics, English language, Malay language, commerce, basic 
economics and living skills. The proposed financial education framework comprises the 
following six financial literacy elements. Their respective learning standards for different school 
grades have been used by the MOE as key reference in the embedment of financial education 
into the school subjects: 
 Money, Source of Income and Career Choice; 
 Financial Responsibility and Decision Making; 
 Money Management and Planning; 
 Savings and Investments; 
 Credit and Debt Management; 
 Risk Management, Wealth Protection and Insurance.

Brazil 
The leadership of a multilateral body and the creation of a public-private partnership 
Brazil‟s National Strategy for Financial Education (Estratégia Nacional de Educação Financeira 
– ENEF) was formally established by Presidential Decree (Presidency of the Republic of Brazil, 
2010). This act also created the National Committee for Financial Education (Comitê Nacional 
de Educação Financeira – CONEF), to handle the implementation phase of Brazil‟s National 
Strategy (NS). CONEF is responsible for ENEF‟s strategic governance, and coordinates its 
implementation: it sets the objectives of the strategy, and the guidelines and bylaws covering its 
financing, implementation, and evaluation. The Committee is also authorized to create working 
groups with expertise to provide technical support and to approve its own bylaws. 
 
CONEF is composed of the following members: 
1. A Deputy-Governor of the Central Bank of Brazil (Banco Central do Brasil – BCB); 
2. President of the Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM); 
3. Superintendent-Director of Brazil‟s National Superintendence for Pension Funds (PREVIC); 
4. Superintendent of Brazil‟s Superintendence of Private Insurance (SUSEP); 
5. Executive-Secretary of the Ministry of Finance (MF); 
6. Executive-Secretary of the Ministry of Education (MEC); 
7. Executive-Secretary of the Ministry of Social Security (MPAS); 
8. Executive-Secretary of the Ministry of Justice (MJ); and 
9. Four representatives of civil society: The Brazilian Financial and Capital Markets Association 
(ANBIMA), Brazil‟s major stock exchange (BM&FBOVESPA), the Brazilian Association of 
Banks (FEBRABAN), and the Brazilian Insurance Confederation (CNSEG). 
 
The Presidency of CONEF rotates among the first five members listed above. As determined in 
CONEF‟s bylaws, the four representatives of civil society must be chosen among self-regulatory 
bodies recognized by one of the four regulators; industry associations from financial, capital, 
insurance, or pension markets; and consumer protection organizations. These representatives 
have a renewable 3-year mandate. Their current mandates are valid until December 2017. 
 
The establishment of sub-committees and dedicated working groups by project/policy area 
The Presidential Decree creating CONEF also established a Pedagogical Support Group (Grupo 
de ApoioPedagógico – GAP) to provide pedagogical guidance to all ENEF‟s actions. The Group 
 
 
70 
 
is composed of the Ministry of Education (MEC) and the four financial regulators, as well as by 
educational institutions and associations: The National Council of Education, five federal 
educational institutions appointed by MEC, the National Council of Education Secretaries 
(CONSED) and the National Union of Municipal Education Managers (UNDIME). The Ministry 
of Education presides over GAP and also serves as its Executive Secretariat. All the educational 
content of ENEF‟s actions is submitted to the GAP. As a multidisciplinary group, with strong 
methodological background, it is the forum for detailed in-depth discussions that revises and 
approves all financial education pedagogical material. It meets whenever convened, and the 
meetings are usually preceded by intensive revision activity of the documents for discussion. 
Since the beginning of ENEF‟s implementation, GAP has been meeting face-to-face around 3-4 
times a year, with meetings lasting 1-2 days. The consistency of GAP‟s input and approach is 
ensured by the permanent presidency of the Ministry of Education. 
 
The Permanent Technical Commission (Comissão Permanente – CP) is another consultative 
committee part of the national strategy. CP assists CONEF at the technical level, proposing rules, 
parameters and guidelines for ENEF‟s plans and actions. CP also advises CONEF by issuing 
recommendations on possible partnerships, branding of financial education material, financial 
literacy assessments and ENEF‟s website, among others. It is composed of representatives from 
the institutions that are part of CONEF, and its internal governance structure follows CONEF‟s 
presidency rotation scheme. The representatives sitting in the CP are drawn from those directly 
involved in implementing Financial Education initiatives within CONEF‟s members.  
 
Consequently, the meetings of the CP are instrumental in preparing and discussing issues before 
these are submitted to CONEF‟s strategic approval. The CP serves as the forum to discuss the 
details of the implementation of most of ENEF‟s programs, and where most of the hands-on 
work is performed. CP meetings regularly encompass the presence of CONEF's partner Brazil‟s 
Association of Financial Education (AEF-Brasil) (see the case study “Brazil: a public-private 
partnership in action”). 
 
CP meets nearly once a month, mostly via videoconference, and each meeting usually lasts 
around four hours. CP members permanently consult with the strategic levels of their own 
 
 
71 
 
institutions before entering the meetings. Decisions are usually made by consensus and then 
transmitted to CONEF (OECD/INFE Policy Handbook, 2015, page 50). 
 
India 
 
The creation of a new public body in charge of the implementation of the national strategy 
A Technical Group on Financial Inclusion and Financial Literacy of the Financial Stability and 
Development Council Sub-Committee (FSDC-SC) headed by the Deputy Governor, Reserve 
Bank of India, with representation from all financial sector regulatory authorities is the 
institutional mechanism set up to coordinate the efforts of all the financial sector regulators in the 
field of financial education. The National Strategy for Financial Education (NSFE) for India has 
been prepared under the aegis of this Technical Group. 
 
A National Centre of Financial Education (NCFE) has then been established as a specialized 
institution for implementation of National Strategy for Financial Education. It reports to the 
Technical group. The main role of NCFE is creating standard financial education material for 
various segments of the financial sector, develop and maintain a website exclusively for financial 
education which will be a one stop repository of all financial education activities by all the 
financial sector regulators: 
 Reserve Bank of India; 
 Security and Exchange Board of India; 
 Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority; 
 Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority; and 
 Forward Market Commission. 
All the above-mentioned financial regulators fund NCFE through an annual budget approved by 
the Technical Group. NCFE's activities are guided by a Core Committee which comprises one 
senior officer from each of the participating regulators. The mandate of the Core Committee is to 
give in-principle approval to the projects to be implemented by NCFE after going through 
funding needs of the activities/projects of NCFE which will then be placed before the Technical 
Group for approval (OECD/INFE Policy Handbook, 2015, page 51).

Uganda 
 
Bank of Uganda Spearheading development of development of Financial Literacy Strategy  
 
Bank of Uganda has spearheaded the development and implementation of a Strategy for 
Financial Literacy (FL) in Uganda. The rationale behind the Strategy has been to provide focus, 
drive and momentum; encourage the development of high quality resources; encourage the use 
of simple, clear and compelling messages; reduce the risk of duplication and unintended gaps; 
enable partners to learn from each other; and encourage the active participation of a wider range 
of stakeholders. 
 
During this process, the Bank of Uganda has engaged more than 150 stakeholders. This 
structured consultative process aimed to mobilize the expertise and resources of a broad range of 
organizations, developing a strategy founded on the principles of cost-effectiveness, cooperation, 
sustainability and feasibility. The development of the Strategy has been supported by the German 
Development Cooperation through GIZ and guided by a high-level Financial Literacy Advisory 
Group comprised of influential decision makers drawn from the public, private and NGO sectors.  
The process culminated in the launch of the Strategy on Friday 16th August, 2013. The Financial 
Literacy Website was also launched at this event. 
Strategy for Financial Literacy in Uganda 
The Strategy for Financial Literacy in Uganda recommends priority activities through five major 
channels, or “strands”. 
 
Financial Education in Schools: Incorporation of FL into the secondary school curriculum as 
part of the overall reform of the curriculum, as well as into the primary school curriculum 
through the development of supplementary materials and teachers‟ trainings; extension of extra-
curricular FL activities. 
 
Financial Literacy for the Youth: Incorporation of FL into university exit courses and training 
of community FL mentors who incorporate FL into the activities of already existing youth clubs 
and associations. 
 
Financial Literacy and Rural Outreach: Provision of FL trainings to rural communities, 
capitalizing on existing trainings and trainers. This includes the use of a variety of community 
channels, such as community radios, community parliaments, and many more. 
 
Financial Literacy in Workplaces, Clubs & Associations: Improving FL at formal workplaces 
through presentations and trainings, as well as presentations being held to informal workers 
through their associations. 
 
 
73 
 
Use of Media for Financial Literacy: Development of a lively and vibrant website dedicated to 
FL; engagement of newspapers and magazines and radio to increase their FL content, as well as 
the use of social media. (Source: Bank of Ghana; 2019)
