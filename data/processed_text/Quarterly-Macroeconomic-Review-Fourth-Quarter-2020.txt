Recent Developments and Outlook  
 
We largely retain the macro forecasts from our last quarterly review in November 2020, 
including our expectations for near-term growth (4.1% this year, 7.5% next year). Compared 
to our projections last quarter, we expect inflation will be slightly worse, the budgetary 
stance broadly unchanged, and the banking and BOP outlook somewhat better.  
 
§ Growth: We continue to project 4.1 percent growth for the current fiscal year, on the basis 
of a broadly unchanged crop output, 9 percent growth in industry, and 4 percent growth in 
services. Although there is much uncertainty on the crop outlook (which may surprise to the 
upside), underlying our growth forecasts for industry and services are expectations that covid 
impacts are fading away, that the recent conflict will not have material macro effects, and 
that credit growth from the banking system will continue at its current strong pace.  
 
§ Inflation: After a series of low monthly price increases, a spike in food prices in January 2021 
has brought an unexpected 1.6 percent month-on-month increase in prices, undermining 
what had been a steadily improving inflation outlook. A reversal of some excise tax cuts, fuel 
price increases, and the pass-through of these fuel price increases (to transport and retail 
prices) will keep inflation elevated in the coming months, despite favorable base effects. We 
adjust slightly upwards our inflation projections to 13.4% by June 2021 and 10% by end-2021.  
 
§ Fiscal policy: Despite multiple shocks, the budget deficit this year is likely to show a ‘normal’ 
level of near 3 percent of GDP (judging from year-to-date trends). As a result, the public debt 
ratio should end the year at 52% of GDP, roughly unchanged from last year, helped too by 
stricter limits on new SOE borrowing. Though exact magnitudes are still to be determined, 
debt service reprofiling by foreign lenders is likely to provide—by our estimates—some 
$300mn to $550mn of relief by stretching out around $2bn of repayments due in 2021.  
 
§ Banking: The banking sector shows no signs of slowing growth, and both deposits and loans 
have largely continued along their pre-covid trajectories. Mid-2020 data do not show a major 
spike in NPLs, and even a modest likely increase this coming year would be manageable given 
low initial (NPL) starting positions, good provision levels, and strong growth in new lending.  
 
§ Balance of payments: After a substantial deficit in 2019-20, the BOP position should swing 
to a sizeable surplus this fiscal year. This will be mainly due to a sharp drop in imports, which 
are down 10 percent and will be roughly $3.5bn lower this fiscal year compared to five years 
ago.  Besides the much-reduced import bill, higher exports, rising airline receipts, and a 
recovery in remittances are also compensating for what is likely to be a lower-than-initially- 
expected inflow of grants. The completion of the IMF first review (for which staff-level 
agreement was recently announced and Board approval likely soon) will unlock substantial 
fx funds and debt service relief, further boosting the outlook for foreign exchange reserves.  
 
§ Exchange rate: A major overhaul of the fx regime does not appear on the horizon for 2021. 
We expect the central bank to continue using a gradual exchange rate crawl in managing the 
currency, with a pace of adjustment that is likely to be slower this year given declining 
inflation and improving balance of payments conditions. We expect the Birr will depreciate 
by at most 15 percent over the course of 2021 compared to a 23 percent drop seen in 2020.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS: 
  
§ 
Among economic indicators for 
which first half of (fiscal) year data 
is available, strong growth trends 
are observed in deposit growth (up 
26 percent aided by the recent 
currency conversion), bank lending 
(up 33 percent), and exports (up 21 
percent in dollar terms). 
 
§ 
Moderate growth is seen in tax 
collections, telecom activity, and 
power generation. 
 
§ 
Negative growth, largely reflecting 
covid impacts, is seen in areas such 
as tourism arrivals, industrial park 
exports, ECX trading, and fuel 
consumption. However, many of 
these same indicators show a 
better 
picture 
when 
seen 
sequentially (i.e. monthly trends 
over the course of 2020, as shown 
below). 
 
Monthly or Quarterly Trends:  
 
§ 
Looking at monthly and/or quarterly activity trends since early 2020, many indicators show an improving 
trajectory, including a pronounced ‘V-shaped’ recovery in some areas.

Growth Outlook 
§ 
The outlook for this year’s crop 
harvest—one of the most important 
determinants of Ethiopia’s GDP 
growth rate—is quite mixed due to a 
range of factors whose net impact is 
uncertain. We are inclined to expect 
a crop harvest that will be close to 
last year’s outturn of 33.5mn tons 
(or 335mn quintals). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
§ 
On the investment front, we expect 
that the investment-to-GDP ratio 
will be similar to last year’s outturn, 
but with a small likely drop in private 
investment. External savings is also 
likely to be lower, consistent with a 
lower current account deficit.  
 
 
 
 
 
§ 
Our forecast of 4.1 percent GDP 
growth reflects near-zero growth in 
agriculture and expectations for 
moderate growth in industry and 
services, as covid impacts are 
gradually fading away and most 
large sub-sectors are now either 
fully/mostly re-opened (construc-
tion, airlines, public administration, 
education, health) or gradually 
recovering (tourism, hospitality).  
 
§ 
For next fiscal year, growth of 7.5 
percent is a reasonable projection, 
in 
our 
view, 
with 
conditions 
normalizing for crops and further 
recovery in industry and services.

PRICES AND INFLATION: Recent Developments and Outlook 
Inflation outturns: 
 
§ Overall inflation of 19 percent in 
January 2021 continues to be 
driven by large price increases for 
the three largest items in the CPI 
index: cereal grains (17% weight 
and 24% inflation), and housing 
and utilities (17% weight and 12% 
inflation), and vegetables (12% 
weight and 23% inflation).  
 
 
§ Specific line-items showing the 
largest inflation rates include 
cooking 
oil 
(35%), 
alcoholic 
beverages (34% due in part to 
higher excise taxes), cereal grains 
(24%), 
vegetables 
(23%) 
and 
miscellaneous 
food 
products 
(26%). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Prices and Inflation… continued: 
§ 
Focusing 
on 
this 
year’s 
persistent sources of inflation—
namely cereals, vegetables, and 
housing & utilities—there is 
some moderation in the latter 
category, whose inflation is 
now 11.5%, but still elevated 
inflation rates for cereal grains 
and vegetables.

Prices and Inflation… continued: 
§ 
As 
before, 
the 
regional 
variation in inflation continues 
to be substantial, with a 17 
percentage point gap between 
the highest and lowest regions. 
This suggest that transport and 
logistics constraints continue to 
heavily affect consumer price 
levels across regions.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
§ 
After five continuous months of 
very 
low 
(even 
negative) 
month-on-month 
price 
increases, 
January 
2021 
surprised with a large 1.6 
percent 
jump 
in 
monthly 
inflation. This is equivalent to 
21 percent on an annualized 
basis if it were to continue at 
this monthly pace.  
 
§ 
The dominant impact of food 
price increases is apparent from 
the 2.1 percent month-on-
month increase for food prices 
versus just a 1.2 percent 
month-on-month increase for 
non-food prices.

Prices and Inflation… continued: 
§ 
With respect to the outlook for 2021, 
global prices for key commodities 
have been rising sharply in recent 
months—especially fuel, wheat, and 
sugar—and will thus keep price levels 
elevated for these imported items. We 
thus expect a lower disinflation path 
than previously projected. 
 
§ 
The February-June period of the fiscal 
year normally shows a median month-
on-month inflation rate of 1.25 
percent, per CPI data for the past 
decade. However, prices during those 
five months rose by a much higher 2.5 
percent (m-o-m) average last year, 
which will favorable base effects for 
year-on-year comparisons this year. 
Taking this into account, and utilizing 
average 
month-on-month 
price 
increase that are somewhat above the 
historical norm (i.e., 1.45 percent), our 
inflation projections show near 16 
percent by March 2021 and 13 percent 
by June 2021.  
 
 
 
MONETARY POLICY: Recent developments and outlook 
 
Monetary growth: 
 
§ 
Reserve 
money 
growth 
has 
accelerated this past quarter, while 
broad 
money 
growth 
remains 
moderate.  The spike in reserve money 
growth may reflect temporary end-
year balance effects (linked to the 
currency conversion that ended in 
December) and it is not clear if this will 
still show up in upcoming months.

§ 
Seen over a three-year time 
frame, broad money growth 
continues to grow in line with 
its annual average growth of 
near 25 percent, while reserve 
money 
growth—at 
31 
percent—is 
substantially 
in 
excess of its recent norms.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Loans by Sector: 
 
§ 
Credit growth over the past 
year was strongest for domestic 
trade, 
export 
loans, 
and 
housing and construction loans.  
 
§ 
By 
contrast, 
below-average 
rates of loan growth are seen 
for the hotels & tourism and 
transport sectors.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bond issuance: 
 
§ 
Outstanding bond issuance has 
increased in recent quarters, 
after stabilizing somewhat in 
late 2020. The latest stock of 
outstanding SOE and Regional 
Government bond issues now 
stands at Birr 414bn, up 21 
percent from year-ago levels.

BANKING: Recent developments and outlook 
 
 
§ 
Deposit levels across both 
private and public banks have 
risen significantly, aided in part 
by the currency conversion that 
boosted cash deposits and new 
account openings in late 2020. 
 
§ 
Bank lending also continues to 
show strong growth (up 39 
percent at private banks and 25 
percent 
at 
CBE) 
despite 
expectations that covid impacts 
would reduce overall loan 
demand and restrain new bank 
lending. This reveals the high 
level of excess demand for 
credit at banks, even in the 
midst of some expected drop in 
demand from covid-affected  
sectors. 
 
 
§ 
Seen over a multi-year time 
frame, growth rates for credit 
are not that far off their recent 
averages, while deposit growth 
rates are noticeably above the 
average range seen in the past 
two years.

FISCAL POLICY: Recent developments  
 
Revenue performance 
 
§ 
Revenue performance continues 
to exceed government targets, 
with first half figures up 17 
percent from year ago levels. 
 
§ 
Despite a strong depreciation, 
there is limited (4%) growth in 
trade taxe collections, reflecting 
the sharp drop in overall imports. 
The 26 percent growth in taxes 
related to domestic activity 
suggests 
expanding 
domestic 
economic activity, though one-
off gains related to recent tax 
amnesty 
measures 
may 
be 
contributing somewhat to this 
strong performance. 
 
 
FISCAL POLICY: Recent developments  
 
§ 
Viewed on a quarterly basis, Q2 
revenue (normally a seasonally 
high period of collections given 
October-December business tax 
payments) is well above post-the 
COVID lows seen during January 
to June 2020, but only 7 percent 
above revenue collections for the 
same quarter last year.

Budget performance: 
 
§ 
While only one quarter of 
budgetary performance data is 
available (to Sep 2020), the 
observed quarterly deficit of 
Birr 9bn is well below the 
annual budget figure of Birr 
126bn.  
 
§ 
Capital spending appears to be 
showing significant restraint 
(slow execution), given its 36 
percent decline vs last year 
(though this may also reflect 
lumpy spending patterns over 
the quarters).  
 
Public debt, in USD terms: 
 
§ 
Total 
public 
sector 
debt 
reached 
$54.6bn 
as 
of 
December 2020, with nearly 55 
percent 
now 
representing 
external debt.   
 
§ 
The dollar value of domestic 
public debt has shrunk slightly 
as the depreciation of the Birr 
has reduced the USD value of 
Birr-denominated debt. 
 
 
Public debt, relative to GDP: 
 
§ 
Expressed relative to GDP, 
public debt now stands at just 
51 percent of GDP (using the 
Dec 2020 debt value and 
estimated 2020-21 USD GDP).  
Even with some new debt 
accumulation to June 2021, the 
public debt to GDP ratio is likely 
to end the fiscal year at around 
52 percent of GDP.

External debt stocks 
 
§ 
External debt has trended up in 
the last two years, reflecting 
large 
loan 
disbursements 
following 
much 
stronger 
engagements with the IMF and 
World Bank.  
 
§ 
Relative to USD GDP, which will 
be roughly the same in 2020-21 
as it was in 2019-20 due to 
exchange rate effects, the debt 
ratio 
has 
moved 
upwards 
slightly from 26 percent of GDP 
two years ago to near 28 
percent of GDP at present.  
 
 External debt service 
 
§ 
Recent data on external debt 
service show $991mn in total 
principal and interest payments 
over the past six months, with 
most 
of 
this 
reflecting 
payments by state enterprises 
to mostly bilateral and private 
lenders.

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS (BOP): Recent developments  
 
 
§ 
First quarter BOP data (July-Sep 2020)  
show a much improved trade deficit 
versus the same period last year and 
also 
notably 
better 
remittance 
inflows, which are up 17 percent from 
year-ago levels.  
 
§ 
On an annual basis, the trade deficit is 
likely to end up at just under $10bn on 
current trends, and thus below 10 
percent of GDP for the first time in 
more than a decade. 
 
§ 
Reflecting these developments, the 
current account deficit in the first 
quarter fell to half its year-ago levels 
(just $729mn vs $1.4bn) 
 
§ 
In the capital account, first quarter 
trends show somewhat lower FDI           
(-10%) 
and 
much 
lower 
net 
government borrowing, both of which 
contributed to reduced total capital 
account inflows.  
 
§ 
The overall BOP deficit was limited to 
below $200mn for the quarter, 
substantially below that of the same 
period last year.

FX reserves: 
 
§ 
The NBE’s fx reserves stood at 
$3,069mn at end-December 
2020, a slight decline from the 
peak of $3,277mn seen in 
September 2020, but up from 
the $2,965mn level of a year-
ago.  
 
§ 
For commercial banks, their fx 
reserve holdings have improved 
notably throughout 2020, rising 
from $754mn at end-2019 to 
$1,107mn at end-2020.  
 
 
 
 
TRADE PERFORMANCE: Recent developments 
 
 Export performance: 
 
§ 
Overall export performance 
continues to register strong 
growth, thanks mainly to gold. 
 
§ 
Besides gold, other products 
performing 
well 
include 
oilseeds 
(recovering 
from 
previously poor performance), 
chat, electricity, and flowers.  
 
§ 
Weak performance is seen for 
coffee, pulses, textile products, 
and leather products.  
 
§ 
The 
underlying 
export 
performance so far this year is 
not as strong as suggested by 
the headline figures; non-gold 
exports are down 4 percent 
versus the same period last 
year.

Import performance: 
 
§ A major drop in imports is being seen across 
virtually all key categories—including for 
raw materials (-14%), fuel (-37%), capital 
goods (-17%), and durable consumer goods 
(-22%). 
 
§ A sharp exchange rate depreciation is the 
most likely explanation for this across-the-
board drop, although some product-
specific factors (lower oil prices before their 
recent spike) are also likely an important 
contributor.   
 
§ Looking ahead, large increases in recent 
global commodity prices will partly reverse 
the sharp import decline of the last six 
months. This explains our projection for a 5 
percent drop in imports for the full year 
(2020-21), versus the 10 percent decline 
seen so far in the fiscal year. Most notably, 
global oil prices are up 35 percent from 
year-ago levels (near $62 per barrel now vs 
$46 per barrel a year-ago), while food 
prices (as captured by FAO’s food price 
index) are up 16 percent from year-ago 
levels and at multi-year highs for many 
items such as wheat, cooking oil, and sugar. 
 
 
 
§ Capital goods imports are also down 
substantially from year-ago levels across 
virtually 
all 
key 
categories 
(except 
agricultural-related capital goods, which 
are a small sub-category).

EXCHANGE RATE: Recent developments and outlook 
 
 
§ 
After moving at an average rate of 
60 cents per month for 2020, the 
exchange rate has reach Birr 39.44 
as of January 2021 versus 32.06 a 
year-ago 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
§ 
As 
expected, 
the 
rate 
of 
depreciation has moderated in 
recent months, and is now showing 
a 23 percent depreciation from 
year-ago levels versus a 28 percent 
depreciation in November 2020.

§ 
The gap between the official and 
parallel market rates had declined 
somewhat in the second half of 2020 
but has reverted back to its average 
range of between 25-30 percent as 
of early 2021.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Exchange rate developments and outlook:  
 
§ 
For the period ahead, we expect no 
major change in the fx regime and 
thus anticipate the central bank to 
continue using a gradual exchange 
rate crawl in managing the currency.  
 
§ 
We expect the pace of adjustment 
this year will be slower given 
declining inflation and improving 
balance of payments conditions.  
 
§ 
With the central bank likely to focus 
on avoiding a real appreciation of 
the Birr, we expect the Birr will 
depreciate by at most 15 percent 
over the course of 2021, compared 
to a 23 percent drop seen in 2020. 
This translates into a Birr level of 
near 42 per USD by June 2020 and 
near 44 per USD by December 2020.
