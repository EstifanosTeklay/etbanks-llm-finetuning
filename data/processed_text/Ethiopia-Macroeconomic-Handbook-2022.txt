With the conflict in Ethiopia turning out much more prolonged and devastating than 
many observers (including ourselves) anticipated, the Ethiopian macroeconomy has—
for over a year now—found itself in a difficult war-time footing, facing immense 
humanitarian and security costs, as well as a heavy toll in terms of lost social and 
physical infrastructure. Heading into 2022, however, conditions appear to be emerging 
for the economy to move away from a conflict mode and towards recovery and 
reconstruction.  In this context, we consider a set of ten questions and concerns 
regarding recent economic developments as well as near-term prospects. We also offer 
our views on what we see as a plausible baseline macro outlook—including projections 
for the real, monetary, fiscal, and external sectors—under that presumed scenario.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 
Recent developments 
 
1. Growth and Recent Economic Activity: The Government recently reported growth of 6.3 percent for FY 2020-
21, but this figure largely reflects conditions before the intensification and geographic spread of the conflict in 
July 2021. For the current fiscal year, crop production, tourism, construction, and industry are likely to be heavily 
impacted by conflict effects as well as by recent tightening in credit and fx conditions. A set of 25 economic 
activity indicators compiled to gauge recent developments show mostly positive trends for 2020-21 but reveal 
a lower share of growing indicators—and thus underlying weakness—for the six months ending December 2021.    
 
2. Deficits and Debt: Fiscal policy has been relatively restrained even in the face of shocks that have required 
exceptional spending outlays (covid last year, the conflict this year). This has been possible because policymakers 
tend to make expenditure cuts to previously budgeted items rather than let the budget deficit balloon out of 
control. While we do expect the budget deficit to worsen, this should be only moderately so, or from 2.7 percent 
of GDP last year to near 4 percent of GDP, per our estimates. Despite lower foreign funding, the Government 
has managed to meet its extra financing needs by turning to domestic sources—the NBE, banks, and pension 
funds. External debt service obligations were fully paid in 2021, the Government’s local borrowing costs remain 
relatively contained at 8%-10%, and debt ratios are falling slightly—to 50% of GDP—thanks to a rising nominal 
GDP. Reflecting these and other factors, fears of an imminent debt crisis are overblown, in our view. 
 
3. Money and Inflation: Monetary policy has (very generously) accommodated the government’s need for 
substantially higher domestic borrowing this year, and net credit to the Government—especially from the 
central bank—has thus grown at rates not seen in many years. While the Government’s ability to cover its deficit 
from mainly domestic sources is positive, this does come at a cost to other parts of the economy—seen with the 
decline in growth of credit to the private sector and the sharp increase in Ethiopia’s (already high) inflation rate. 
 
4. Banking: Despite multiple shocks from covid, the conflict, and a challenging regulatory space, the banking sector 
has continued to show a strong and resilient performance—reflecting in turn what must be reasonably strong 
private sector demand for loans and other banking services. Deposits, lending, and profits were at record levels 
across virtually all banks. The most recent six month period brought a more challenging environment (a complete 
credit freeze put in place in late 2021, an increase in reserve requirements, and a change in fx surrender rules), 
but most banks are well-placed to weather even these recent shocks thanks to a deposit base that is still growing 
(though less so than before), healthy lending margins, generally low NPLs, and much improved capital bases.  
 
5. Exports and Imports: Strong export growth has been an unexpectedly positive element of Ethiopia’s 
performance both in the face of Covid and throughout the recent conflict. More recently, imports are also 
surging (up 24 percent this year) after showing negative growth for most of the past five years. The 20%-plus 
growth being recorded for both exports and imports is partly due to exogenous factors (higher coffee/gold prices 
for the former, and rising fuel/food/fertilizer prices for the latter). But volume effects have also been significant 
(often more so) for multiple export categories such as gold, oilseeds, chat, fruits, vegetables, and electricity.   
 
6. Foreign exchange: Little progress was made in boosting foreign exchange inflows in 2020-21, and this remains 
one of the main macro and business bottlenecks within the economy. Fx inflows reached close to $22bn last 
fiscal year, not much changed from the levels seen in recent years.  Aid-related fx flows (grants, loans) fell by 
one-third in 2020-21 but private sector fx inflows (exports, remittances, FDI) more than compensated for that 
shortfall. The net fx position of the banking system has declined since the start of the current fiscal year, and a 
temporary drop in the NBE’s fx reserve holdings—to just under $2bn—is thus to be expected by June 2022.

7. Exchange rate: As a managed currency, the Birr’s movements have continued to reflect central bank preferences 
for a gradual and controlled depreciation. By contrast, the parallel market rate was more volatile and moved in 
tandem with conflict-related sentiments and developments. The Birr has been depreciating at an annualized 
rate of 26 percent throughout this fiscal year, virtually the same rate as last year. However, while the rate of 
depreciation exceeded the inflation rate for all of last year (thus bringing a welcome real depreciation of the 
currency), the situation has reversed this year as depreciation rates are now well below recent inflation rates, 
thus potentially contributing to a real appreciation (strengthening) of the Birr if current trends continue. 
 
Future Prospects and Outlook 
 
8. Putting it all together: In distilling the recent record of macroeconomic performance, some key elements and 
implications are worth highlighting. First, even with efforts to track a wide mix of indicators on the status of 
current macro conditions, there are clearly some unknowns and uncertainties that may be limiting a full view of 
the macro picture; thus, the possibility of a more challenging macro situation than appears to be the case cannot 
be ruled out. If, for example, the scale of humanitarian spending requirements, or the volume of crop losses, or 
the scope of damaged infrastructure is well beyond current indications, then the fiscal/external implications—
and associated set of policy responses—will only become that much more challenging. Second, despite the 
uncertainties involved, it can still be said that the macroeconomy has been relatively resilient in the face of 
multiple shocks, with recent reforms seeming to have helped in this regard. Third, and irrespective of how one 
judges the recent record of macro performance, it is clearly becoming the case that macro policies are (as of 
early 2022) making tentative steps to move the economy away from its war-time footing and towards a focus 
on recovery and reconstruction; a much more dedicated roll-out and intensified implementation of the Ten Year 
Development Plan (TYDP) can thus now reasonably be expected in the immediate period ahead. 
 
9. Macro Policy Directions: With respect to the likely path of macroeconomic policy in 2022, policymakers face 
challenging choices in three notable areas: (1) whether to tighten or loosen macro policies, both in the fiscal and 
monetary arenas; (2) whether to pursue mainly domestic or mainly external financing sources for reconstruction 
spending; and (3) whether to ensure priority resource allocations (most notably of credit and forex) to the public 
or private sectors. So far, and understandably so given the circumstances, the policy bias has been towards 
loosening rather than tightening, towards domestic rather than external financing, and towards directing 
resources (fx/credit) to the public sector rather than private sector. We address how far and how soon we think 
there will be a reversal in each of these areas.  
 
10. Macro Projections: Our baseline macro outlook takes the view that a growth slowdown is unavoidable this fiscal 
year (given developments in the last six-month period) but that a strong growth bounce back is almost inevitable 
next year, conditional on the assumption of a de-escalation in the conflict as well as a gradual return to normalcy 
across key economic sub-sectors (farming, commerce, and infrastructure links). Based on this presumed 
backdrop, and some other specific assumptions for the macro framework (see Section 10), we forecast:                 
(1) growth of just 1% this fiscal year followed by 6.5% next year; (2) a very gradual decline in inflation that is only 
achieved over the course of the next 18 months; (3) a quick improvement in the fiscal deficit from 4 to 3 percent 
of GDP by next year (allowing for continued small reductions in debt ratios); (4) a monetary policy stance that 
gradually moves to a somewhat looser position by next year as there is progress on inflation; and (5) an external 
position that continues to weaken up to mid-2022 but strengthens substantially thereafter thanks to (what we 
expect will be) on-going growth in exports/remittances, a re-launching of the delayed privatization program, and 
a closer re-engagement with external donors, lenders, trading partners, and investors.

Section 1: Growth and Recent Economic Activity 
 
• We review recently released GDP data for 2020-21 as well as an additional set of 25 activity indicators to gauge the 
underlying ‘pulse’ of Ethiopia’s economic performance over the past year.   
 
• Among the varied set of economic activity indicators compiled, we highlight areas of positive and negative growth, 
while also drawing distinctions between observed nominal vs real growth rates. We further track outturns during 
the latest six month period—for those indicators with available data—to capture any notable trend breaks since 
the intensification and geographical spread of the conflict starting in July 2021. 
 
• Of the 25 indicators tracked, more than half showed positive real growth during 2020-21 (which ended June 2021), 
but this share has dropped notably since then, with only around one-third now exhibiting expansion in real terms.    
 
In an effort to capture the record of recent economic activity in Ethiopia, we compile a set of 25 indicators—beyond 
GDP growth—to capture a broad view of economic conditions and performance.  These indicators go some ways in 
capturing both the positive fruits of policy reform put in place since 2018 while at the same time showing the more 
recent consequences of economic shocks faced from COVID and the civil conflict.  
 
• 
GDP Data for 2020-21: The Government’s recent release of national income statistics reveals real GDP growth 
rate of 6.3 percent for the 2020-21 fiscal year that ended in June 2021. Sector growth rates were  5.5% for 
agriculture, 7.3% for industry, 6.3 percent for services. These growth figure largely reflect conditions in the 
economy before the intensification and geographic spread of the conflict in mid-2021 and it also largely pre-
dates the tightening of financial conditions imposed in subsequent months (including a credit freeze put in 
place in the second half of 2021). While some observers may find the reported growth figure questionable, the 
data appear to reflect and seem justified by: (1) the very favorable rainy season of 2020-21 (with 8 percent 
more rain falling nationwide in 2020-21 compared to the prior year, per meteorological data); (2) the credit-
supported recovery that was in place in 2020-21 for some key sub-sectors (construction, exports, and some 
services); and, (3) perhaps most importantly, the fact that the conflict had not widened geographically until 
the last days of the fiscal year in end-June 2021. Key elements of the GDP data release are on pages 4 to 6.  
 
• 
Trends in a set of 25 high frequency indicators, which are released on a monthly or quarterly basis, provide 
an additional perspective on the strength or weakness of economic activity in specific segments of the 
economy. Our compilation of indicators in this regard covers trends in rainfall, crop output, industrial park 
output, FDI, electricity generation, fuel consumption, government revenue, exports, imports, grants, loans, 
remittances and more. Among these indicators, we find areas of strength for FY 2020-21 include FDI, credit, 
exports, revenue, and remittances, while areas of weakness are seen in cement production, tourism, and 
grants.  More recently, focusing just on the July-December period, areas of weakness included trends in credit 
to the private sector, external loans, and fx reserves. A tabulation of these indicators is in pages 7 to 11.  
 
Overall, our reading of recent economic data suggests to us that: (1) The 2020-21 GDP growth figure appears plausible 
as it pre-dates the more intense conflict period that occurred after June 2021 and given our own estimates of real 
growth recorded for a sample of 25 activity indicators; (2) There is clearly a slowdown in activity taking place over the 
last six months, though its magnitude varies substantially across different sub-sectors; and (3) Some of the rapid growth 
rates in key indicators (such as credit to government, monetary variables, FDI) has been real and substantial but—it 
must be noted—are reflective of either one-off factors (i.e., privatization) or are not necessarily welcome or desirable 
(i.e., rapid monetary growth) as they tend to deliver a short-term boost to economic activity at the expense of what 
may be adverse longer-term economic consequences, including most notably higher inflation (see Sections 2 and 3).

GDP Data: Part 1 
 
• 
The government’s recent release of GDP statistics shows real GDP growth of 6.3 percent last year, in contrast 
to the 3 percent average decline seen across Sub-Saharan Africa last year.  
 
• 
This reported growth rate reflects strong performance in agriculture (largely rainfall dependent and aided 
by various policy initiatives) as well credit-supported recoveries in services (whose growth rose from 5.3 
percent to 6.3 percent). Industry showed positive growth but at a lower rate than past norms, likely 
reflecting its greater reliance on fx conditions and some conflict-related disruptions.

GDP Data: Part 2 
 
• 
The investment to GDP ratio has continued to slide for a second year in a row and now stands at 28 percent 
of GDP, down from 35 percent of GDP in 2018-19. This appears to reflect a small drop in public investment 
alongside a more significant drop in private (and especially domestic) investment. The implication of a lower 
investment share in GDP is higher consumption, implying a greater portion of spending by firms, households, 
and government is taking place on consumable goods and services rather than on new capital goods.   
 
• 
The drop in the investment ratio is consistent with other indicators—such as capital goods imports—that 
also fell by around 6 percent in dollar terms—last fiscal year. While FDI inflows rose during this period 
(boosted in part by exceptional inflows from the telecom license sale), this is a small component of overall 
investment and did not offset declines in the other categories.

GDP Data: Part 3 
 
• 
Among the large GDP components, the fastest rates of growth last year were recorded in health care (up 
13%), banking (up 9%), transport/communications (up 7%), and construction (up 7%, though at a multi-year 
low). Mining was the fastest growing sub-sector both last year and over the past five years, though this is a 
reflection of its very tiny initial base (at less than 1 percent of total GDP).  
 
• 
Given the pattern of recent growth rates, the composition of GDP now shows the construction segment just 
as large as the crop sector (both at 21% of GDP), followed by wholesale/retail trade (14%), the livestock 
sector (8%), transport and communications (5%), and manufacturing (5%).

High Frequency Indicators Data: Part 2, Implied FY 2020-21 Growth from HFIs 
 
• 
The 25 high frequency indicators show a simple average growth of 1.5 to 2.2 percent last fiscal year 
(depending on the inclusion/exclusion of certain outliers).  
 
• 
Using an approximate weighted average method in line with GDP computation methods suggests an overall 
real GDP growth for these 25 indicators of 4.2 percent, which is somewhat below but not substantially 
different from the 6.3 percent official growth rate reported in GDP statistics.

High Frequency Indicators Data: Part 3, Latest Year-to-Date Outturns  
 
• 
Although only around half of the high frequency indicators are available for the first quarter or first half of 
this fiscal year, a similar compilation again reveals a wide dispersion in growth rates among sub-sectors.  
 
• 
Among the set of available indicators for this fiscal year, only around one-third are now exhibiting expansion 
in real terms, suggesting some underlying weakness in economic activity in the six-months to Dec 2021.

High Frequency Indicators Data: Part 4, Areas of Strength 
 
• 
In reviewing the trends among the high frequency indicators, the segments showing strong expansion 
and/or real growth more recently include: overall exports, industrial park exports, imports, quarterly 
revenue, money supply, net credit to government, bank profits, and tourism inflows (the latter due to an 
unusually year-ago base).  
 
• 
It is notable that the positive real growth in some of these indicators—such as for money supply, credit to 
government, or imports—are not necessarily positive developments to the extent they are adding to 
inflationary pressures, crowding out private sector credit, or involving fx outflows to the rest of the world.

Section 2: Deficits and Debts 
 
• Ethiopia is facing a widening budget deficit this year, as the conflict has reduced some revenue collections while 
simultaneously bringing sharply increased spending in certain areas. Still, due to a long-standing practice of relying on 
expenditure cuts and re-adjustments in the face of economic shocks, the increase in the deficit should be relatively 
moderate—from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2020-21 to 4 percent of GDP this fiscal year, per our estimates.  
 
• Even with limited grants and loans to support the budget, the financing of the deficit has so far been manageable 
thanks to the Government’s ability to borrow from domestic sources—namely from the NBE, commercial banks, and 
pension funds. The NBE has provided funding via direct advances and the banks and pension funds via T-Bill purchases. 
 
• A rising budget deficit, a sharp fall in the price of Ethiopia’s sole external sovereign bond, and multiple rating agency 
downgrades (by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, Fitch) are all bringing a sense of an imminent debt crisis among many 
observers. However, the likelihood of a debt default remains very low, in our view, as Ethiopia faces mainly a debt 
servicing burden (due to a bunching up of repayments over the coming years) rather than a debt stock problem, and 
it is also actively seeking solutions with foreign and domestic lenders to address the short-term repayment pressures.  
 
This section reviews recent fiscal and debt developments and summarizes in particular:  
 
• 
The fiscal outturns for the most recent fiscal year (2020-21), which were marked by a budget deficit of 2.7 
percent of GDP and a public debt stock of USD $55.6bn, or roughly unchanged at 51% of GDP (pgs 14 to 15). 
 
• 
The contents of the Government Budget approved for the current fiscal year, which reflected decisions taken 
well before the intensification of the conflict in July 2021 and—on that basis—showed planned expenditure of 
Birr 562bn, with the top allocations to roads (Birr 67bn), education (66bn), debt service (45bn) (pg 16-17).  
 
• 
The status of budgetary developments in the current fiscal year, which on the basis of financing data to end-
December 2021, point to a widening deficit that is mainly being covered by domestic sources (pg 18). 
 
• 
Debt sustainability considerations, which suggest slightly better debt stock ratios over the past few years 
(Debt/GDP, Debt to Exports) but still challenging debt service burdens (pg 19). 
 
Taking into consideration all of the above, the likelihood of the Government facing a debt default appears very low, 
even though efforts will continue to seek debt service relief to stretch out repayments due over the coming years. The 
public debt burden has fallen from 59 to 51 percent of GDP in the past three years, and the external public debt burden 
from 31% to 27% of GDP. Ethiopia met all external debt obligations in 2020-21, paying out close to $2bn worth of principal 
and interest repayments during the fiscal year. In addition, faced with a decline in external funding, the Government has 
managed to finance its extra spending by re-allocating existing budgetary items and by using domestic sources (the central 
bank, commercial banks, pension funds) to cover the moderately larger deficit. Reductions in subsidies (for fuel, utilities) 
are being implemented to minimize fiscal costs. Also working in the Government’s favor is the fact that it has not seen any 
material spike in borrowing costs, as its external loans are largely at low and fixed rates, the sovereign bond has a fixed 
6.65% coupon (irrespective of the changing yields), and domestic T-Bills yields have remained in the range of 8-10 percent 
despite conflict conditions. There will remain a need for debt service relief, mainly on SOE debt, but initiatives in this area 
are already in place both for the external component (via the IMF/G20 ‘Common Framework’ scheme) and for the domestic 
component (via a new debt management vehicle). With much improved prospects for exports and other fx inflows 
(including a lower current account deficit), on-going strengthening in revenue, and continued reliance on concessional 
borrowing, the overall debt burden should thus become increasingly more manageable over the coming years.

Fiscal developments: last year’s main outturns, revenue, expenditure and deficit financing 
 
• 
Preliminary data on last year’s fiscal outturns suggest revenue and expenditure outturns of around 90 
percent of budgeted levels, which left the deficit not substantially different from budgeted levels (Birr 115bn 
vs Birr 126bn).  
 
• 
The budget deficit amounted to 2.7 percent of GDP, not much changed from its ratio in the year earlier.  
 
• 
The gross change in domestic debt for the year (based on debt data) was close to Birr 168bn, though this 
overstates the deficit since it does not account for Government deposit balances at banks.

**Note: Gross borrowing is not equivalent to the fiscal deficit and will be higher than net debt and net credit to 
government given repayments for the year and movements in deposit balances at NBE and at Banks. Thus, net 
credit to Government figures (net budget deficit financing) for the fiscal year is  less the the gross figures

Fiscal developments: last year’s main outturns, public debt developments 
 
• 
Public Debt in dollar terms has risen slightly from $54.9bn in June 2020 to $55.6bn in June 2021 and further to 
$56.7bn as of September 2021. This total public debt stock is roughly evenly split between external and 
domestic debt.   
 
• 
Relative to GDP, the public debt stock has fallen from 51.1 percent of GDP in June 2020 GDP to 50 percent of 
GDP in June 2021. With a higher USD GDP denominator (of ~$116bn) anticipated for the current fiscal year, the 
September public debt figure of $56.7bn will show a further decline—to 47.1 percent—relative to GDP. Low 
accumulation of new debt and on-going repayments explain the gradual decline in debt ratios.

Fiscal developments: Current Fiscal Year Developments, 
 
• 
Budgetary developments for the current year can be inferred from monthly revenue data released by the 
Ministry of Revenue (available to November 2021), quarterly debt data from the Ministry of Finance 
(available to September 2021), as well as monthly data on Treasury Bill auctions from the NBE (available as 
of end-December 2021).   
 
• 
Notable trends to date include: (1) continued strong revenue collections of Birr 127bn in the first five months 
of the year, up 17% year-on-year; (2) gross government domestic borrowing of Birr 76bn for the first quarter 
of the fiscal year; and (3) T-Bill related net borrowing of Birr 82bn for the first half of the year. Given overlaps 
in the latter two financing sources, we estimate total borrowing for the first half of the year is close to Birr 
100bn, suggesting a moderately wider deficit that is likely to reach Birr 200bn for the full fiscal year.

Fiscal developments: Debt Sustainability considerations 
 
• 
Key debt sustainability metrics show relatively moderate debt burden ratios, including: (1) debt to GDP falling 
to 50 percent; (2) an external public debt ratio of just 27 percent of GDP; and (3) an even lower NPV of 
external public debt to GDP ratio of 19 percent (to account for concessional rate debt). The NPV of external 
debt to goods exports remains high (at 588%) but is much more moderate (157%) if one accounts for the fact 
that Ethiopia’s recurring fx inflows include not just goods exports but also service exports and remittances.  
 
• 
On the debt service side, there is indeed a heavier burden observed, consistent with Ethiopia’s request for 
debt service relief as opposed to debt stock reductions.  Annual external public debt service of near $2bn in 
recent years is about a quarter of revenue and half percent of exports; however, considering again the full 
scope of recurring fx inflows in the Ethiopian context, debt service payments are around 14 percent of the 
three main recurring current account inflows (goods exports, service exports, and remittances).

Section 3: Money and Inflation 
 
• With an expansionary fiscal stance dominating macro policy, monetary policy has played a subservient role over the past 
year and found itself accepting and accommodating the need for large government borrowing.  
 
• Reflecting the above, net domestic credit to government (as of September 2021) was up 94 percent from year ago levels, 
and is showing the highest growth rates in over a decade.  NBE, commercial banks, and pension funds have stepped in 
to cover the jump in government borrowing. 
 
• While the ability of Government to fund its deficits from domestic sources is positive, and understandable under the 
circumstances, this of course comes at a cost to other parts of the economy. Two major casualties with this policy 
approach are seen with: (1) the drop in growth of credit to the private sector; and (2) the spike in inflation. 
 
Ethiopia has in the past year provided a clear case of ‘fiscal dominance’, wherein monetary policy is largely driven by 
and working in the service of financing expansionary budgetary policies. Most notably: 
 
• There has been a large growth in broad money, reflecting in large part an expansion in credit to government and 
state enterprises. Money supply was up 30 percent for the 2020-21 fiscal year (from Birr 1,038bn to Birr 1,348bn) and 
is still showing high growth, of 28 percent year-on-year, as of September 2021. This expansion has been driven by and 
is mainly the counterpart of: (1) the increase in net banking system credit to government (which rose from Birr 137bn 
in June 2020 to Birr 287bn as of September 2021, or by Birr 150bn over the 15-month period); and (2) the Birr 115bn 
increase in state enterprise debt (from Birr 487bn to Birr 602bn per MOF data) over the same period.  
 
• Despite the expansion in money supply, the foreign exchange component (foreign assets) declined over the course 
of 2021. Fx reserves fell from $3.1bn at end-2020 to $2.9bn as of June 2021 and to $2.2bn by September 2021 (the 
latter equivalent to near 2 months of imports). The drop in such official (NBE) fx reserves reflects the Government’s 
use of fx funds (debt service, fuel, and other public sector imports) that is not offset by new sources of fx inflows—
which for the NBE are primarily from grants, loans, privatization receipts, and fx funds surrendered by commercial 
banks (previously 50% now 70%).  As commercial banks fx reserves strengthened over the same period, the decline in 
overall banking system fx reserves was more modest (from $4.4bn to $4.0bn between June 2020 and September 2021). 
 
• Crowding out of the private sector is taking place, given the high growth in credit supplied to the government. After 
many years of improved allocations to the private sector, the combination of higher deficits and a drop in external 
financing, has reduced the pool of loanable funds available to the private sector. As of September, growth in credit to 
the non-government sector was only 17 percent year-on-year (below inflation), while an estimate of growth to the 
private sector (excluding state enterprises) reveals a level decline during the July-September 2021 period.  
 
• Strong monetary growth appears to be contributing to inflation, even if it is certainly not the sole culprit: An analysis 
of the main components of inflation suggests that multiple factors—beyond just monetary policy—are having a 
contribution, including supply-side disruptions to food markets, transport bottlenecks, rising global commodity prices, 
and a strongly depreciating exchange rate.  On the specific role or weight of monetary policy, while the link between 
monetary growth and inflation is not clear-cut, the fact that the recent spike in inflation follows a jump in net credit to 
government (and particularly a jump in central bank credit to government) is strongly suggestive of at least a partial 
causal relationship. Moreover, even if other factors are at play, it is the case that monetary policy can play a role to 
offset those other contributors, which has not—so far—been the case in the Ethiopian context.   
 
The underlying data and charts summarizing the above key trends is summarized in the following pages 21-29.

Monetary and credit conditions: Broad Money and Net Credit to Government from the Banking System 
 
• 
Recent rates of broad money growth (30% y-o-y as of June 2021 and 28% y-o-y as of September 2021) have 
been above the 26 percent average annual growth of the past decade, but not substantially so.  
 
• 
However, the recent growth in the banking system’s net credit to the Government is the highest seen in over a 
decade. Net credit to the government from the banking system has nearly doubled between September 2020 
and September 2021, from Birr 148bn to Birr 287bn, and is up by Birr 140bn or 94 percent.

Monetary and credit conditions: Sources of credit to government 
 
• 
A broader measure of Government borrowing that captures all domestic financing sources (including from non-
banks) shows a similar expansion in the year to September 2021, with funding provided by commercial banks, 
NBE, DBE, pension funds, and non-bank, non pension fund institutions.  
 
• 
On this broader basis, gross domestic credit to Government is up from Birr 467bn to Birr 671 bn, or an increase 
of Birr 204bn in the year to September, for growth of 44 percent.

Monetary and credit conditions Foreign reserves drawdowns 
 
• 
Official foreign reserves of the NBE have trended downwards for most of the past year and fell from $3.1bn as 
of June 2020 to $2.8bn as of June 2021 and to $2.2bn as of September 2021.  Over the same period, fx reserves 
of commercial banks rose from $1.1bn to $1.8bn, helping offset the overall loss in banking system fx reserves 
 
• 
Fx reserves stood at near 2.4 months of imports as of June 2021, and have not declined much in terms of months 
of imports due to the drop in imports from near $17bn five years ago to only $14bn last year. Relative to GDP, 
fx reserves have trended downwards from near 5 percent five years ago to 2.6% of GDP last fiscal year.

Monetary and credit conditions: Crowding out 
 
• 
Growth in credit to the Non-Government Sector (including state enterprises and private firms) has fallen below 
20 percent for the first time a over a decade. Moreover, after a continued upward trend for most of the past 
decade, the ratio to GDP begun to fall for the first time last year.   
 
• 
An estimate of credit to private firms, derived by subtracting changes in SOE domestic debt, shows a level 
decline in credit to the private sector since the start of the fiscal year. Per our estimates, of the Birr 325bn in 
banking system credit expansion between end-June and end-September 2021, 43% was extended to 
government, 32% to state enterprises, and only 26% to the private sector. This has reduced the stock of private 
sector credit to 43 percent of total credit from a ratio of near 50 percent last year.

Monetary Conditions and Inflation: 
 
• 
The recent increase in inflation has moved closely with growth in money supply, especially since mid-2020; 
however, despite the positive correlations, the longer-term relationship is not very tight or consistent. For 
example, the five relatively low inflation years between 2013 and 2017 showed mostly single-digit inflation 
despite the fact that M2 growth in those years was relatively elevated at around 25-30 percent (Figure 3.5A).  
 
• 
Exploring the relationship more formally using 10 years of quarterly data suggests a modest but not very strong 
relationship between monetary growth and inflation (Figure 3.5B). Alternative monetary measures (using net 
credit to government and net central bank credit to government) were considered, including with lagged 
effects, but the results suggest monetary influences are only one of many determinants of inflation.

Inflation Trends: Longer-term and cross country context 
 
• 
While Ethiopia tends to experience periodic episodes of inflation, such as in mid-2015 and mid-2018, the current 
episode stands out for reaching near decade-long highs, especially since the start of the conflict in Nov 2020.  
 
• 
From a cross-country context, Ethiopia’s experience also stands out, especially among other Sub-Saharan 
African countries facing a similar global environment. Inflation is low and declining, on average, for most of SSA 
compared to an upward trend in Ethiopia.

Inflation Trends: Underlying sources by product and other categories 
 
• 
A breakdown of inflation by key components shows: (1) the strong dominance of food rather than non-food 
items; (2) the larger role of goods rather than services; and (3) the dominant role of ‘domestically produced and 
domestically consumed items’ vs other categories such as export goods or imported goods.

Section 4: Banking performance 
 
• The banking sector continued to show a strong and resilient performance last year, despite multiple shocks from 
COVID, the conflict, and a challenging regulatory environment.   
 
• The underlying basis for this positive performance is the banking sector’s substantial expansion of lending to the 
overall economy, which suggests strong underlying demand from private sector businesses.  
 
• Conflict impacts have been concentrated in a few banks. The stock of NPLs across of the 16 private banks was near 
Birr 23bn against a loan balance of Birr 507bn, equivalent to a system-wide ratio of just under five percent.  
 
The banking sector has come out of both COVID pandemic and the recent conflict in relatively good shape and its 
performance in the fiscal year ending June 2021 was generally satisfactory. Other than a few exceptions, banks enjoyed 
strong growth in deposits, loans, profits and shareholder returns.  Among the notable developments in the sector: 
 
• 
Bank balance sheets: Total bank deposits reached Birr 1.36 trillion (31 percent of GDP) in June 2021, or a 30 percent 
increase from the year before. The large deposit growth helped fund a 37 percent rise in loans, from Birr 590mn to 
Birr 809mn; other uses of deposits—besides loans—includes bonds held by commercial banks (445bn), NBE Bills 
(80bn), and T-Bills (54bn). Banks’ paid-up capital base reached Birr 95bn as of June 2021 or 5% of total assets. Loan-
to-Deposit ratios of 80% as of June 2021 were at record highs and, given reserve requirements and precautionary 
cash needs, indicative of banks’ having effectively deployed virtually all their deposits towards lending activities.    
 
• 
Income statements: Net interest income still forms the core source of banks’ earnings, totalling Birr 72 bn for 
all commercial banks. Other income, mainly fx fees, provided an additional Birr 36bn of income, for total gross 
income of above Birr 100mn. Profits (before taxes) reached Birr 20.4bn at private banks and Birr 19.3bn at the 
CBE. In dollar terms, the banking sector’s profit pool now exceeds $1bn (given 39.4 year-average exchange rate).  
 
• 
Margins: Lending spreads have remained in the 7-8 percent rate at private banks and around 4 percent at CBE. 
For 2020-21, private banks had a 13.4 percent effective lending rate, a 5.3 percent effective deposit rate, and 
thus a spread of 8.1 percent. CBE showed a 8.8%/5.0% effective lending/deposit rates for a spread of 3.8%. 
 
• 
NPLs: Non-performing loans remain below 5 percent at all but a few banks.  For the private banking sector as a 
whole, their stock of NPLs is near Birr 24bn, against a loan book of near Birr 500bn and total capital of Birr 95bn.  
 
• 
Shareholder returns: The earnings per share (EPS) at private banks dropped notably from 34 percent two years 
ago to 28 percent last year, reflecting an increase in their paid-up capital base that has not been matched by 
growth in profits.  Reflecting high inflation, the sector’s average real EPS return fell below 10 percent last year. 
 
• 
Market shares: Private banks’ collective market share continues to trend up, reaching 46 percent for deposits. 
For a second year in a row, private banks collectively reported a slightly higher profit (51%) versus CBE.  
 
Current year trends and outlook: While most of the above represent 2020-21 outturns, the most recent six month 
period (July-December) has brought a more challenging environment, including a credit freeze put in place in July 2021 
(subsequently reversed), an increase in reserve requirements, and a change in fx surrender rules that now call for banks 
to sell 70 percent—instead of 50 percent—of their fx inflows. Still, with an ability to boost lending for the remainder of 
the year, most banks remain well-placed to weather these as they benefit from high credit demand, healthy lending 
spreads, fee-based income streams (for those with strong fx flows), and generally low NPL/provision expenses.

Recent performance of Private Banks: Deposits, Loans, Capital and Branch Networks 
 
• 
Despite covid and the conflict, private banks continued to perform strongly in FY 2020-21 across most metrics—
including on deposits, loans, capital increases, and outreach expansion via branches/staffing.  
 
• 
Loans rose by Birr 163bn for the fiscal year, funded by a Birr 178bn increase in deposit mobilization.

Recent performance of Private Banks: Profits, Return on Assets, and Return on Equity 
 
• 
Pre-tax profits rose to record levels of Birr 20.4bn at private banks and Bir 19.3bn at CBE, for a combined sum 
of near Birr 40bn. With these profits, their combined tax dues amounted to Birr 12bn last year, or an effective 
rate of 30 percent.   
  
• 
Profits were equal to 2.3 percent of year-average assets (ROAA), and 16.6 percent of year-average total capital 
(ROAE). Both represent trend declines from recent years and reflect the fact that profit growth has not kept up 
with capital/asset growth at most banks. The declines are also suggestive of lower fee-based income growth at 
most banks due in part to more challenging fx conditions.

Recent performance of Private Banks: Underlying sources of strong performance 
 
• 
Last year’s results were driven by a greater deployment of mobilized deposits, as seen from loan-deposit ratios 
reaching 80 percent as of June 2021 from just 64 percent three years ago.  
 
• 
Adjusted loan-deposit ratios (taking into account banks’ reserve requirements and need for precautionary cash 
balances) are now above 100 percent for the second year in a row, and show very limited scope to engage in 
additional lending beyond recycling repayments on past disbursed loans (as opposed to by deploying a higher 
share of already mobilized deposits).

Recent performance of Private Banks: Underlying sources of strong performance, part 2 
 
• 
The private banking sector continues to benefit from comfortable lending spreads, with effective lending rates 
at 13.4 percent, effective deposit rates at 5.3 percent, and a spread of 8.1 percent. The spread has been rising 
since 2015 (when it was closer to 5 percent) but remains well below rates of inflation. 
 
• 
Also supporting banks’ strong underlying performance has been a cost-to-income ratio that is still favorable 
from a cross-country perspective, even though it has risen notably in the last two years from 39 percent to 46 
percent, reflecting large branch/staff expansions, IT deployments, and higher compensation expenses.

Recent performance of Private Banks:  Underlying sources of strong performance, part 3 
 
• 
Seen over a longer-term perspective, and applying a Dupont analysis to banks’ underlying earnings, the primary 
contributors to the strong returns of Ethiopian banks continues to be their sizeable net interest margins (near 
6% of assets), significant other income (3.3% of assets) and generally low operation costs and provisions.  
 
• 
Most banks rely heavily on net interest income, but about a fifth of private banks have a greater reliance on 
other income (reflecting fee-based, mostly fx-related businesses). 
 
• 
Long-standing structural features of the banking system continue to work in most banks’ favor: excess demand 
for credit and foreign exchange gives banks relatively strong pricing power in both areas and a reliance (for the 
most part) on collateral-based lending practices makes possible relatively low provision related expenses.

Recent performance of Private Banks:  NPL trends 
 
• 
While NPL levels and ratios increased notably this past year, reflecting a combination of COVID and conflict 
effects, the increase has been contained to below 5 percent for the industry as a whole.  
 
• 
Special mention loans (those between 30-90 days overdue) have also remained close to their recent year norms 
of near 7 percent of total loans.  
 
• 
NPL levels are also covered partly by provisions and remain well below banks’ paid-up capital cushions.

Banking Sector Market Shares: Part 2  
 
• 
Private banks’ collective profits also continued to exceed that of the state bank for a second year in a year, with 
pre-tax profits of Birr 20.4bn vs Birr 19.3bn at CBE.  
 
• 
Taken together the profit pool of the Ethiopian banking system is now near Birr 40bn, or just above $1bn at the 
year-average exchange rate. Bank profits are equivalent to just around 1 percent of GDP, not much changed 
from recent years.

Banking Sector: Shareholder Returns, part 1  
 
• 
Earnings per share at private banks have fallen somewhat to 28 percent last year after remaining comfortably 
in the 30 percent range for most of the past decade, and reaching as high as 34 percent two years ago.   
 
• 
Accounting for last-year’s elevated inflation of near 20 percent, real returns to shareholders have fallen 
significantly to 9 percent, one of the lowest levels in almost a decade. Returns on banking nonetheless remain 
better-yielding investment alternatives compared to other financial assets (e.g. deposits).

Banking Sector: Shareholder Returns, part 2  
 
• 
Seen over a long timeframe, last year’s 28 percent average EPS return is only slightly below the 32 percent 
average seen over the past dozen years. 
 
• 
The dispersion in shareholder returns across banks continues to be quite wide, with some of the best performing 
banks on this score seeing EPS returns above 40% against the single-digit returns seen at the lower end.  
 
• 
The dispersion in returns reflects, in turn, large variations in banks’ size, balance sheet composition, income 
sources, lending margins, cost structures, and efficiency metrics—as summarized Fig 4.18, 4.19.

Banking Sector: Current Year Trends and Outlook   
 
• 
Latest banking sector data show deposit levels crossing Birr 1.48bn as of December 2021. Their growth rate is 
nonetheless slowing, to just 9 percent in the first six months of the year (June to December 2021) and 22 percent 
year-on-year as of December 2021. Lending was up 12 percent in the first half of this year and is now showing 
year-on-year growth rates of just 23 percent after annual growth rates of 28-31 percent in recent years. 
 
• 
Loan-to-deposit ratios at private banks have reached 87 percent, versus 81 percent in June 2021. An adjusted 
loan-to-deposit for the sector (taking into account banks’ reserve requirements and need for precautionary cash 
balances) is above 100% and points to very tight liquidity positions at most banks; in such a scenario where 
available deposits are effectively fully deployed, gross new lending is largely dependent on the timing and 
volume of repayments of previous loans.

Section 5: Exports and Imports 
 
• Strong export growth has been an unexpectedly positive element of Ethiopia’s performance even in the face of COVID 
and throughout the recent conflict. While part of the improved performance reflects exogenous factors (a sharp jump 
in global coffee and gold prices), there were also encouraging volume increases for commodities such as gold, flowers, 
fruits/vegetables, chat, and electricity. Overall, in fact, volume effects were more significant than price effects in 
explaining the increase in last year’s export values.  
 
• Imports have surged recently, rising by 24 percent year-on-year in the first five months of the fiscal year, after showing 
minimal growth in 2020-21 and negative growth in each of the prior four fiscal years. This reflects not just higher 
commodity prices but also volume increases in areas such as wheat and fertilizer imports.  Higher imports point to 
higher fx supplies becoming available, either through official bank channels, via franco valuta imports (based on 
importers’ own fx sources), or via non-official routes.  
 
Both exports and imports are growing strongly this fiscal year after six years of staying broadly unchanged at ~$3bn for 
exports and four years of being flat at $14bn-$15bn for imports. The recent jump in their levels reflects a combination 
of factors, but is predominantly due to the sharp rise in global commodity prices. Using trade data for both 2020-21 and 
available trade data for the first five months of this fiscal year, the following trends are notable: 
 
• 
Export mix: Ethiopia’s top six exports (with the exception of gold) continue to be made up of agricultural 
commodities—namely coffee ($909mn, 25% of total), gold ($672mn, 19%), flowers ($471mn, 13%), chat  
($403mn, 11%), oilseeds  ($336mn, 9% of total), and pulses ($234mn, 7%). Price increases were more significant 
for coffee and pulses, but volume increase were instrumental in most other cases (gold, chat, and flowers).  In 
fact, of last year’s $629mn export increase, we estimate $473mn or 75% was due to volume effects (primarily 
reflecting a three-fold jump in gold export volumes) while the remaining 25 percent reflected price effects.  
 
• 
Export destinations: The largest buyers of Ethiopia’s exports are Switzerland ($670mn, mainly gold) Netherlands 
($294mn, mainly flowers), and the US ($276mn, mainly coffee and textiles); these three countries absorb 19%, 
8%, and 8% respectively of total exports. Regional countries (Somalia, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Djibouti, and Sudan) 
make up most of the remaining top 10 destinations. China, though once the no1 export market taking up $240mn 
of exports, has now dropped to 14th place with just $68mn of purchases.  
 
• 
Import mix: By product, the composition of imports is still dominated by fuel ($1.8bn, 13% of total), cereals 
($1.3bn,9%,), fertilizers ($0.7bn, 5%), pharmaceutical products ($0.7bn, 5%), and  chemicals ($0.5bn, 3%).  
 
• 
Import origins: Imports continue to originate mainly from China ($3.2bn, 23% of total), India ($1.8bn, 12%), the 
US ($1bn, 7%), the UAE ($0.9bn,7%), and Turkey ($0.8bn,5%). 
 
Overall, although exports are substantially below potential and the recent improvement mainly reflects the role of 
one dominant item (i.e., gold, which explains 75% of the export increase), the resulting improvement in Ethiopia’s 
trade balance is nonetheless a very welcome development. At just 9.7 percent of GDP, the trade deficit is now half 
of what it was—relative to GDP—as recently as five years ago. Thanks to this, the current account deficit—at just 2.9 
percent of GDP—is also now at its lowest level in over a decade. This decline reduces the reliance on all external 
(capital account) funding sources that generate future liabilities (i.e. FDI, foreign loans), and thus places Ethiopia in a 
much stronger position with respect to external sustainability.

Export Performance: Trends in Recent Years, part 1 
 
• 
While gold was the biggest contributor to export growth last year, coffee is taking on that role this fiscal 
year. Gold made up 75% of the $629mn export increase last year, while coffee is—so far into the fiscal 
year—making up about 85% of the $288mn five-month increase in exports.  
 
• 
Just six export items—coffee, gold, flowers, chat, oilseeds, pulses—continue to make up about 82 percent 
of overall exports, a ratio that is roughly unchanged from last year. 
 
• 
Several of last year’s strong growers continue to post double-digit growth this fiscal year, including for 
commodities such as chat (12%), flowers (18%), fruits and vegetables (56%), and meat (65%). Two 
manufactured export categories (textile products and leather products) were 5.1 percent of total exports 
last year and remain at essentially that ratio so far into this fiscal year (5.5 percent).

Export Performance: Trends in Recent Years, part 2 
 
• 
Looking at the sources of export growth between volume and price effects, last year’s export value 
increase can be largely attributed to volume effects—though this only reflected on volume developments 
for one commodity, namely gold.  
 
• 
The increase in gold export volumes (nearly double from prior year levels) explained most of the gold value 
increase, which in turn explained 75 percent of the overall export inflow increase.  
 
• 
For this fiscal year, gold export volumes are seen to have declined 6 percent year-to-date, while coffee 
volumes have increased sharply and been instrument in driving recent growth, alongside notable volume 
increases for items such as flowers, chat, meat, and fruits and vegetables.

Export Performance: Trends in Recent Years, part 3 
 
• 
A ten-year overview of export trends shows that last year’s strong growth finally reversed a nearly decade-
long slide in the share of exports to GDP.  
 
• 
The exports-to-GDP ratio of 3.4 percent nonetheless remains very low in a global context. Had Ethiopia 
just maintained its export share to GDP at its level of ten years ago (9% of GDP), last year’s exports would 
have amounted to $10bn rather than $3.6bn.

Export Performance: Exports by Destination 
 
• 
Looking at export demand sources, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the US, continue to dominate the 
top three positions, with exports to Switzerland mainly comprised of gold, exports to Netherlands mainly 
flowers, and exports to the US mainly coffee and textile products.  
 
• 
Regional export markets make up 5 of the top 10—including Somalia, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Djibouti, and 
Sudan. China has dropped significantly as an export destination, at 14th place and just $68mn in purchases 
last year, despite it being the top market (absorbing $240mn of Ethiopia’s exports) as recently as 2017-18.

Import Performance: Trends in Recent Years   
 
• 
Petroleum imports and cereal imports (mainly wheat) continue to dominate the top two shares of total 
imports, each taking up more than $1bn of imports last year.  
 
• 
Reflecting much higher global prices, both categories have already crossed $1bn in imports for the first five 
months of this fiscal year and are on track to surpass $2bn for the full year at current trends.

Exports and Imports : Imports—A Ten Year Perspective 
 
• 
Despite import increases last year and particularly at the start of this fiscal year, imports are shrinking 
substantially relative to the size of the overall economy when seen over a decade-long time frame.  
 
• 
The drops in imports relative to GDP are relatively broad-based, affecting fuel, consumer goods, and capital 
goods. In terms of composition of imports, while capital goods were once a larger share of total imports 
than consumer goods, this has now been reversed—with consumer goods taking up 38 percent of total 
imports against a capital goods share of 27 percent.

Exports and Imports : Imports by Country of Origin 
 
• 
China continues to be the leading origin for Ethiopia’s imports—as has been the case for the last 19 years.  
Around 23 percent of imports ($3.3bn out of $14.3bn) are sourced from China and the share is even higher 
if looking just at non-oil imports ($3.3bn out of $12.4bn or 27 percent).  
 
• 
Besides China, three other countries from whom Ethiopia purchases close to a billion dollars of imports 
include India ($1.8bn, 12% of total), the US ($0.96bn, 7%), and the UAE ($0.94bn,7%).

Section 6: Foreign exchange flows 
 
• Gross fx inflows reached $21.5bn last fiscal year, a slight improvement from the preceding year but below the levels 
seen two years ago. This figure reflects the sum of goods exports ($3.6bn), service exports ($4.9bn), remittances 
($5.2bn), other private transfers ($1.2bn), official grants ($1.2bn), external borrowing ($1.4bn), and FDI ($3.9bn).   
 
• On the outflows side, the biggest uses of foreign exchange are goods imports ($14.3bn), service imports ($4.3bn), and 
repayments on foreign debt ($1.8bn).  
 
• Reflecting the balance of all fx inflows and outflows over the course of the year, the net foreign assets of the banking 
system rose modestly in 2020-21, suggesting a small surplus on the balance of payments. The fx balance increase seen 
during FY 2020-21 reflected higher commercial bank fx balances, which rose by an amount sufficient to offset declines 
in central bank foreign assets. Available data since July 2021 show a decline in the fx position of both NBE and 
commercial banks (thus marking a BOP deficit) since the start of the fiscal year.  
 
The limited availability of foreign exchange supplies remains of the main macroeconomic and business bottlenecks in 
Ethiopia, and little progress has been recorded in this area in recent years. Gross fx inflows were close $22bn last year, 
a 10 percent improvement from the prior year but essentially back to their levels seen two years ago. At the same time, 
key fx outflows in the form of imports, service imports, and debt service have remained elevated allowing for very limited 
net surpluses (and thus fx reserve accumulation) in recent years. Indeed, the reverse has been the case with the 
drawdown of available reserves used to cover annual fx gaps: official fx reserves have fallen in two out of the last three 
years, and in four of the past five years. 
 
As is highlighted in the tables that follow, the following elements are notable from the most recent data on Ethiopia’s 
fx inflows and outflows:  
 
• 
Fx inflows—trends and composition: Contrary to the common perception, the biggest sources of fx inflows in 
recent years have not been goods exports but rather items such as service exports, remittances, and FDI. For the 
most recent fiscal year, 2020-21, fx inflows have been characterized by:  
o 
A jump in exports and in the export contribution to total fx inflows (from 15 to 17 percent of total); 
o 
A recovery in remittances flows, which are now $5.2bn per year and 24 percent of total fx inflows; 
o 
Continued strong FDI inflows ($3.9bn), though this is largely due to the telecom license sale ($850mn) 
effected in June 2021;  
o 
A drop in external grants to just $1.2bn, from an annual average of $1.5bn over the prior five years; 
o 
A drop in external loans to Government to just $1.2bn, from an annual average of $1.8bn over the prior 
five years; 
o 
A drop in external loans to the rest of the public sector (mainly state enterprises) to just $0.4bn, from an 
annual average of $1.4bn over the prior five years—reflecting in part deliberate policy initiatives to limit 
such borrowing; 
 
• 
Fx outflows—trends and composition:  On the outflow side, besides the large annual $14bn import bill faced in 
recent years, the largest source of fx outflows reflect large repayments on the accumulated foreign debt. For 2020-
21, it is notable that debt service repayments of $1.8bn were effected (principal and interest), against new foreign 
loans of just $1.4bn, implying a net negative transfer $0.4bn in loan-related financial flows from Ethiopia to the 
rest of the world.

Foreign Exchange Inflows: A Long-Term View  
 
• 
Gross foreign exchange inflows peaked at $22.4bn in 2018-19 and have generally stayed within the range of 
$20bn-$22bn over the past five years. The largest contributors to fx inflows continue to be remittances ($5.1bn 
annual average in recent years), services ($4.4bn annual average) and goods exports ($3.0bn annual average). 
 
• 
Looking at composition shifts over the last six years, the biggest jumps are seen in service exports (up from 15% 
to 23% of total inflows) and in loans to state enterprises, which are down from as much as 18% of total inflows 
in 2014-15 to just 2% last year (the latter reflecting in part policy choices to limit new SOE borrowing).

Foreign Exchange Inflows: A Long-Term View  
 
• 
FX inflows have risen not kept up with growth in nominal GDP, which is up 3.5x in the past decade while 
average fx inflows are only up 1.9x. Some fx inflows show level declines since a decade ago.  
 
• 
FDI is the best performing fx inflow line-time in terms of its percentage increase over the past decade, rising 
3.2x during this period or roughly in line with the increase in USD GDP.

Foreign Exchange Outflows: A Long-Term View 
 
• 
On the outflow side, imports have made up on average around three-quarters (or ~$14bn-$15bn) of the 
annual use of Ethiopia’s fx inflows. 
 
• 
Looking at compositional shifts, debt service payments show the biggest jump over the past six years, rising 
from just 4% to 9% of total use of fx funds, or up from $993mn to near $2bn in recent years.

Foreign Exchange flows: A Schematic Overview of Inflows, Intermediaries, and Users  
 
• 
The three main groups handle most of the fx intermediation in the market—NBE, CBE and private banks. Each 
of these groups handles between $5bn to $8bn in fx inflows per year, with CBE and NBE likely at the higher end 
of that range and the private banks collectively towards the lower end (with the largest among private banks 
handling close to $900mn last year while mid-range banks handle $400mn per year).   
 
• 
The three large fx pools are marked by relative different fx supplies: for NBE, inflows are mainly loans, grants 
(excluding the surrender requirements from private banks); for CBE, they are mainly goods exports, service 
exports, remittances, FDI inflows, and other private transfers; and for private banks they are mainly 
remittances, other private transfers, goods exports, FDI inflows.

Foreign Exchange flows: Aid-related Flows vs Private Sector Flows  
 
• 
A notable distinction can be drawn between ‘aid-related fx inflows’ and ‘private sector fx flows’. The former 
would apply to inflows from official multilateral/bilateral agencies (grants and loans) as well as ‘other private 
transfers’ (which include NGO-related inflows); the latter involve mostly private sector businesses/customers 
and would include goods exports, services exports, remittances, and FDI.   
 
• 
Focusing on FY 2020-21 versus the prior five year average, it is notable that ‘aid-related fx inflows’ have 
dropped by 33 percent, while ‘private sector fx flows’ have risen by 16 percent. In USD terms the rise in private 
sector flows (+$2.4bn) has offset the drop in ‘aid-related’ flows (-$1.9bn), thus explaining the small increase 
seen in banking system fx reserves for FY 2020-21 and the relatively benign BOP picture last year.

Balance of Payments Presentation: The Last Five Years  
 
• 
Presenting fx inflows and outflows in the more conventional balance of payments presentation shows a sharp 
drop in the current account deficit last year, to 20-year low of less than 3 percent of GDP. This largely reflects a 
sharp drop in imports relative to GDP, from 19% of GDP to just 13% of GDP last year.   
 
• 
The change in banking system net foreign assets (NFA)—which is the basis for determining the overall BOP 
position—has increased in three of the past five years, including by around $340mn for FY 2020-21. The 2020-
21 NFA increase has, however, coincided with a drop in NBE reserves (from $3.2bn in June 2020 to $2.9bn in 
June 2021), which reflects the fact that the fx increase took place at the commercial banks.

Section 7: Exchange rate  
 
• As a managed currency whose pace of depreciation is policy determined, movements in the Birr continued to reflect 
central bank preferences for a gradual and controlled depreciation over the course of the year. By contrast, the 
Birr’s parallel market rate was more volatile and moved in tandem with conflict-related sentiments and 
developments. 
 
• The nominal depreciation of 26 reflects policy preferences to limit the loss in competitiveness arising from high 
inflation. Such an effort to prevent a loss of competitiveness was realized in 2019-20 (when the depreciation rate 
exceeded the inflation rate), but this became less of a case in 2020-21 and especially more recently in the six months 
to December 2021. 
 
• Although now a clearly stated policy objective in the Ten Year Development Plan, the current absence of a market-
clearing exchange rate in Ethiopia continues to generate excess demand—and thus long waiting times—at 
commercial banks.  
 
Exchange rate developments 
 
The Birr exchange rate vs the US dollar has moved from 39.4 Birr/USD at end-December 2020 to 49.3 Birr/USD at end-
December 2021, or a depreciation rate of 26 percent over the course of the year. The annual year-on-year changes in the 
Birr rate were consistently between 25-26 percent during the past year, suggesting a desired/targeted percentage change 
for the currency of that magnitude.

Exchange rate: Monthly movements and patterns 
 
• The month-on-month change in the currency has average 83 cents this year, up from last year’s average of 
61 cents per month. The annualized rate of change average 26% in 2021, vs just 20% in 2020.   
 
• The Birr has exhibited a somewhat consistent pattern of monthly changes in 2021, swinging between 
depreciation of 60-70 cents in one month, followed by a depreciation of 120-130 cents the following month.

Exchange rate: Recent Trends in a Cross-Country Context 
 
• While most emerging market currencies depreciated during the course of 2021, the Birr has shown a rate of 
depreciation (26 percent) that is among the higher end of this group. Most of Africa’s other large economies 
showed single-digit depreciation rates, including Nigeria (-6%), South Africa (-8%), and Kenya (-4%).   
 
• With inflation exceeding the Birr’s depreciation rate, the currency has shown a real appreciation of about 7 
percent (simply taking inflation outturns less nominal deprecation). However, given rates of mid-single digit 
inflation in most of Ethiopia’s trading partners, the REER appreciation is likely to be somewhat less.

Exchange rate and Inflation:  
 
• Seen over an extended time frame, recent rates of both inflation and depreciation are at multi-year highs.  
 
• Depreciation rates have tended to exceed inflation rates for most of the period between mid-2020 to mid-
2021, imply a real depreciation and enhanced competitiveness for that period. Since mid-2021, however, 
this has reversed to past norms and depreciation rates have failed to match or exceed inflation rates.

Exchange rate: Measures of Overvaluation—REER and Parallel Market Premium  
 
• The parallel market rate reached a high of around 70 Birr/USD during the months of July-September 2021, 
with the corresponding gap with the official rate reaching peaks of near 45 percent. Reflecting subsequent 
policy measures and policy/political developments, the gap between the official and parallel market rates 
has since shrunk to around 30 percent, roughly at the average percentage gap seen over the past three years.  
 
• The REER index has fallen in recent years, from a peak of 198.6 in June 2019 to 179.4 in June 2021, equivalent 
to 14 percent improvement in the currency’s real competitiveness over the two-year period. We estimate 
that the last six months (July-Dec 2021) will have shown a further 5% decline in the REER (given six-month 
nominal depreciation of 12.6%, Ethiopian inflation of 12.5%, and estimated partner inflation of 3 percent).  
Thus, despite the persistence of a parallel market premium, the pace of Birr depreciation over the past three 
years has at least ensured there is no further loss of external competitiveness, after what was nearly a 
decade of steady strengthening in the currency up to 2018. However, if current inflation trends are not 
reversed, there is a potential for the REER to begin rising again and thus undermining competitiveness.

Section 8: Putting it all Together 
 
• What overall conclusions can be reached in distilling Ethiopia’s recent macroeconomic record? First, even with efforts 
to track a wide mix of indicators on the status of current conditions, there are clearly some unknowns and 
uncertainties that may be limiting a full view of the macro picture; thus, the possibility of a more challenging macro 
outlook than appears to be the case cannot be ruled out.  
 
• Second, despite the uncertainties involved, it can reasonably be said that the macroeconomy has been resilient in 
some respects and recent policy reforms appear to have helped in this regard. (This is, of course, not addressing the 
immense humanitarian impacts, social disruptions, and loss in lives and livelihoods linked to the conflict).  As was the 
case with COVID, initial expectations (by some) of catastrophic macroeconomic consequences have not materialized; 
instead certain sub-segments or sub-regions of the economy were heavily affected, but nationwide and macro impacts 
turned out to be more moderate. 
 
• Third, and irrespective of how one judges the recent record of macro performance, it appears—thanks to 
developments as of early 2022—that macro policies are now clearly making tentative steps to move the economy 
away from its war-time footing and towards a focus on recovery and reconstruction. A much more dedicated roll-out 
and intensified implementation of the Ten Year Development Plan (TYDP) can thus now reasonably be expected for 
the period ahead.  
 
Unknowns and Uncertainties:  
 
While available indicators seem to suggest a generally moderate macroeconomic impact, as argued in Section 1, it 
must also be recognized that there are unknowns and uncertainties that may not be fully revealing parts of the macro 
picture. Despite attempts to track a wide range of recent activity indicators, it is the case that: (1) the severity of impacts 
in some critical areas is still yet to be fully documented; and (2) some aspects of economic performance may be poorly 
recorded at this stage. Key areas of uncertainty and/or potentially incomplete data include:  
 
• 
Extent of damage to the stock of social and physical infrastructure: In addition to the immense human and 
social loss inflicted in conflict-affected regions (including losses in lives and livelihoods), stock losses to private 
and public physical infrastructure (roads, factories, schools, hospitals) will have adverse consequences from a 
macroeconomic perspective. Yet, in both areas, the extent of such losses are not yet effectively compiled to 
date and may not yet be recognized for some time given the lack of communications and normal operations in 
many areas.  Recent reports from the Amhara Region have, for example, suggested damage to infrastructure 
of the tens of billions of Birr due to damages to schools, health centres, hospitals and other public facilities. As 
significant or possibly even higher amounts are possible/likely in the Tigray Region once such compilations and 
communications reveal the approximate magnitudes.  
 
• 
Stock losses versus flow losses: While GDP measurements capture the flow/change in goods and services 
produced in a given year, the loss in pre-existing stocks of wealth (say roads, public facilities) may not 
immediately show up in recorded measures of GDP. However, as the loss of these stocks of wealth reduces 
what was routine economic activity related to their use, then declines in economic activity will gradually 
become recognized over time. The impacts from stock losses may thus persist for some period of time.   
 
• 
Crop losses: The degree of crops lost is also a major economic variable for which rough estimates are possible 
but for which firm data are not available. A material level of crop losses is to be expected due to a combination 
of farmlands not being planted in conflict areas, crops being destroyed once planted, insufficient labor being

67 
available to harvest crops, or from post-harvest losses because of disrupted trade/transport lines. Early 
estimates of crop losses and/or expected current crop harvest estimates from agencies such as the Ministry of 
Agriculture may also be poorly recorded if reliant on weak, incomplete, or non-representative  sample surveys 
(this could be in either direction, i.e., via an understating or over-stating of the degree of crop losses due to 
non-representative samples) . As crops are the single largest sector of the economy, the uncertainty on this 
score can have major impacts for (this year’s) estimated GDP levels and growth rates.    
 
• 
Second-round impacts: While immediate conflict impacts may be moderate or weakly captured, it is worth 
noting that such impacts could build up over time if second-round impacts and confidence effects are 
significant. Thus, for example, long-term tourist inflows can take significant time to recover if negative 
perceptions (of the security environment) stay in place, and future FDI inflows could be held back by a sharp 
drop in investor sentiment/confidence from the conflict last year. These effects may not show up immediately 
in current figures (which reflect past investment decisions) but would become material if they persist and are 
not subsequently offset (via say improved policies or active measures) in the period ahead. 
 
• 
Potential new liabilities: War-time economies typically make use of off-budget expenditures or accumulate 
emergency or contingent liabilities that are not formally recorded until well after the conflict subsides; this 
does not appear to be the case based on available information, but if there were some resort to such 
emergency measures, this implies potentially more challenging macro adjustments down the road. 
 
• 
Trends in welfare indicators such as unemployment or poverty levels: Finally, as this report has not focused 
on the humanitarian or social welfare dimensions of recent developments, it is worth underling that there can 
of course be a major divergence between macro and social welfare trends. A positive macro picture may not 
necessarily correspond with and does not necessarily imply, especially over short periods, similarly positive 
trends in say reducing poverty or lowering unemployment. Within the conflict-affected regions, and as widely 
reported, it is clear that a critical humanitarian situation still prevails and that, per UN reports, as much as 9 
million people remain reliant on emergency food assistance and/or temporary shelters. Outside of the conflict-
affected areas, the full scale of social welfare impacts (in poverty and unemployment indicators for example) 
is likely to emerge only slowly and is an area for which up-to-date remains limited.  
 
Economic Resiliency:  
 
While recognizing that the full extent of recent conflict impacts may not all be captured, it is also the case that there 
has been (unexpectedly) strong performance in certain economic indicators and that nation-wide, macroeconomic 
impacts have not necessarily been as severe as might have been expected.  The scope of economic impact and damage 
for affected regions and sectors cannot of course be minimized: perhaps 20 percent of the national population has 
been in immediately conflict-affected areas and perhaps 15-25% of GDP sub-sectors has been exposed to direct conflict 
impacts (a rough approximation taking most of Tigray region being impacted and sizeable parts of Amhara and Afar 
regions as well). Directly recorded impacts on affected economic assets—crops, industry, schools, health facilities, and 
infrastructure—is likely to be in the range of perhaps Birr 200-300 billion, judging by statements coming out from 
regional officials. However, seen in the context of a Birr 5.7 trillion economy (the estimated GDP for FY 2021-22), these 
damages would be on the order of around 5 to 10 percent of the aggregate size of the economy even if conflict related 
losses range from say Birr 250bn at the low end to 500bn at the high end. To the extent that the rest of the  economy 
(the 90 to 95 percent) is broadly unaffected and, from here on, grows even modestly, then nation-wide GDP impacts 
should be notably offset.  In addition, to the extent that some areas of activity performed well or unexpectedly strongly 
(as highlighted in Section 1), that would constitute a further offset of conflict related damages.

The moderate macro impacts of the conflict is arguably partly due to some policy reforms initiated in 2018 and 2019.  
In multiple areas, reforms enacted as part of the Home-Grown Economic Reform Program and related initiatives have 
boosted activity in many sub-segments of the economy. For example, part of the export improvement reflects policy 
reforms in the coffee marketing system that are allowing exporters to make direct sales and earn premium prices, thus 
boosting volumes. Gold exports are up 10-fold (reaching $650mn last year) thanks to financial sector reforms put in 
place by NBE on gold purchase prices. Targeted lending policies instituted following COVID have supported a wide range 
of sectors—in tourism, construction, tourism—to improve their liquidity and operations through generous rescheduling 
and extra financing. The strength of the banking system reflects in part generous rescheduling allowances enabled by 
the central bank. The privatization program has supported FDI and overall fx levels by bringing in large fx inflows (even 
if these are one-off items). Overall, better than expected performance has also been seen in areas such as FDI, mining, 
industrial parks, revenue, deficit financing, banks’ performance, credit flows, exports, remittances and the current 
account deficit (see Figure 8.1).  Taken together, the better performance seen in these areas appears to have played a 
role in off-setting the conflict’s concentrated impacts in the most affected regions.

General Area
Sub-area
Remarks
REAL SECTOR
Crops
Crop production and output  in non-conflict areas of the country is reported by the Ministry of Agriculture to be very 
positive, reflecting good rains, higher fertilizer use, cluster farming practices, and low-land irrigation initiatives
FDI
Foreign investment inflows held up well, though this partly reflects one-off factors (e.g. telecom license sale)
Mining
New/expanding mining sector projects are proceeding in many areas, following greater policy support and 
improvements in this area 
Industrial Park Exports Despite several industrial parks being directly affected by conflict, overall Industrial Park exports held up relatively 
well. IP exports were roughly flat in FY 2020-21 but are up 20 percent in first five months of this fiscal year
Real Sector reforms
Although delayed, many reforms in areas such as privatization, ease of doing business, financial sector, capital 
markets, and public sector debt and governance remain under process and have not been reversed or discarded
FISCAL SECTOR
Revenue
Overall revenue has continued to grow, up near 20 percent in nominal terms, despite much reduced collections in 
conflict-affected areas. 
Budget Deficit
The budget deficit is expanding, but by a much lower degree than might have been expected given policy 
adjustments to prioritze/cut existing budgeted expenditures. 
Treasury Bill Market
Given the reliance of domestic funding, the T-Bill Market has functioned relatively well throughout the year to 
enable the Government to meet its budget deficit financing needs. Funding from the T-Bill markets has gone up 
from Birr 55bn at end-Dec 2020 to Birr 200bn at end-Dec 2021 (both based on outstanding T-Bills issued).
Funding costs
Government funding costs are essentially unchanged whether for external debt or domestic debit. External debt 
remains mostly at concessional rates, the sole external sovereign bond faces a fixed 6.65% coupon payment 
(despite changing yields), and effective T-Bill rates have remained within the range of 8-10 percent. 
Debt ratios
Debt ratios have stayed roughly flat--at around 50 percent of GDP--thanks to growth in the nominal GDP 
denominators
Repayments
Government has met all its debt service obligations on its foreign debt, despite challenging fx conditions

Banks' performance
The banking sector has--with few exceptions--managed the conflict impacts without severe threats to viability, 
profitability, or capital base. Reflecting management reforms, public banks (CBE, DBE) both recorded significant 
improvements in operations and record-high profits in the past year. 
Credit flows
Credit flows to Industry, Agriculture, and Construction sectors all expanded by 20% even during conflict period
EXTERNAL SECTOR
Exports of goods
Exports are growing by over 20 percent thanks largely to favorable global prices for products such as coffee/gold, as 
well as volume expansions being recorded for gold, oilseeds, flowers, chat, fruits/vegetables, and electricity.
Exports of services
Service exports, despite the tough global environment, increased by 4 percent to near $5bn in 2020-21. 
Remittances
Remittances reached a near-record of $5.1bn, up 7 percent from the prior year. 
Exchange rate
The Birr rate has depreciated by the same rate as it did pre-conflict (26 percent), reflecting the managed exchange 
rate regime, and avoiding even more severe or volatile drops that might have been expected in a confict scenario
Current Account deficit The current account deficit has shrunk to its lowest level--relative to GDP--seen in over a decade, limiting the need 
for seeking new external debt financing.

Re-orienting towards recovery and reconstruction  
 
With a notable de-escalation in Ethiopia’s civil conflict as of early 2022, clear signs are emerging that economy policy 
will now gradually move away from its war-time footing towards a focus on recovery and reconstruction.  As of 
January 2022, the Government has presented an large reconstruction spending package (of Birr 5bn and Birr 122bn), 
and thus explicitly signalled its intention to focus on post-conflict recovery and rehabilitation.  Moreover, other recent 
policy signals suggest an intention to make a re-invigorated push towards what is being heralded as an upcoming 
national period of  ‘reconstruction, re-building, and development.’ 
 
The upcoming moves to revive the economic reform and development agenda can be expected to be guided by the 
Ten-Year Development Plan (TYDP) approved last year, although possibly with some modest modifications to account 
for the recent conflict. Accordingly, the road-map for reform contained in the TYDP should be expected to form the 
basis for upcoming policy initiatives that are to be launched and/or re-invigorated in the coming year. To highlight the 
core elements of Ten-Year Development Plan, they include: 
 
o 
Maintaining macro-financial stability: Recognizing the weak past record on inflation and debt, maintaining 
monetary and fiscal policies that reduce inflation and control debt accumulation forms a key pillar of the TYDP. 
To this end, the document targets improvements in revenue collection, better debt management, prudent 
monetary policy, and (over time) a flexible exchange rate. 
 
o 
Boosting Growth in Key Sectors: Seven key economic sectors are singled out for special support and expansion: 
agriculture, manufacturing, construction, mining, trade, tourism and urban development. In addition four 
infrastructure systems are accorded special attention for development: transport, water resources, energy, 
and technology.  
 
o 
Privatization: To limit public sector debt burdens and bring greater competition/efficiency to the economy, 
privatization remains a continued priority and will cover a broad range of sectors.  
 
o 
Financial Sector and Capital Markets: A gradual opening up of the financial sector (via new entrants, new 
products, and new instruments) is envisaged to broaden financial inclusion and better address the financing 
needs of a much wider range of economic participants. Moreover, the establishment of stock and bond 
markets remains an explicit target for the coming years, with a substantial amount of preparatory work already 
underway for the likely commencement of both these markets in 2023.  
 
o 
Public Sector Reform: Given the large size of the public enterprise sector in the economy, including its role as 
producer/employer and major source of past indebtedness, efforts to improve SOE operations remain a 
priority under the TYDP. Initiatives in this area include improving oversign and governance systems and limiting 
their ability to accumulate new domestic/external debt. The Government has set up a new vehicle, the Liability 
and Asset Management Corporation, to address the large legacy of past SOE debt, while it is at the same time 
setting up a public sector investment holding company (Ethiopia Investment Holdings) as another vehicle to 
better manage existing SOEs, to leverage existing and under-utilized public assets, and to embark on catalytic 
investments in under-served areas.  
 
A summary of the key goals, priority reform areas, and strategic pillars of the Ten-Year Development Plan, whose 
implementation can be expected to be actively implemented starting this year, is summarized in TABLE 8.2.

Section 9: Macro Policy—Three Main Challenges and Choices 
 
• Three key challenges and choices will be confronting macro policymakers in 2022. First, there is likely to be a major 
tension between a tightening versus loosening of macro policies, especially in the fiscal and monetary arenas. 
Addressing inflation and other imbalances calls for at least some tightening of policies while reconstruction needs will 
require stepped-up spending and a relaxation of policies in certain areas.  
 
• Second, given the clear need for substantially higher government financing for recovery and reconstruction, an 
important issue is whether this will be sought from mainly domestic or external sources. In other words, will there be 
a more independent (domestically-driven) recovery pursued or instead an internationally-supported one? 
 
• Third, policymakers will need to find the right balance in the allocation of key economic  resources—particularly credit 
and foreign exchange—between the public versus private sectors. The allocation of loanable funds and forex supplies 
tilted heavily towards the public sector last year (understandable in a war-time economy) but how much of this reverts 
back to increased private sector allocations will have a major bearing on 2022 developments and on the business 
operating environment this year.  
 
Tightening versus Loosening: 
 
As is often the norm in many war-time economies, the past year has been marked by macroeconomic loosening in 
fiscal and monetary policies.  To summarize the main areas where such policy loosening has been implemented:  
 
• 
Credit to government has risen substantially. As of September 2021, net credit from the banking system was 
up 94 percent year-on-year (from Birr 148bn to Birr 287bn, or an increase of 3 percent of GDP), while a broader 
measure of funding to government—the change in its gross domestic debt from all sources—shows credit to 
government up 55 percent in the year to September 2021 (from Birr 432bn to Birr 671bn). 
• 
Budgetary spending has been expanded with two Supplementary Budgets of Birr 5bn and Birr 122bn enacted 
in late 2021 to accommodate extra spending for conflict related recovery and reconstruction.  
• 
Foreign exchange policies have been modified to allocate higher shares of fx inflows to the public sector, via 
an increase in banks’ fx surrender requirement from 50 percent to 70 percent; correspondingly, the 40 percent 
dollar previously retained by exporters has been reduced to 20 percent of their fx inflows.   
• 
Pricing policies during most of 2021 were kept at subsidized levels for the public—despite their mounting fiscal 
costs—in areas such as fuel, wheat, cooking oil, fertilizers, and utility/transportation rates (even though more 
recent changes have begun to reduce such subsidies for products such as fuel.)  
 
Difficult trade-offs are bound to be involved for policymakers if they are to address both substantial reconstruction 
spending needs while at the same time not worsening inflation or debt sustainability conditions: 
 
• 
Reconstruction will call for continued loosening in fiscal and monetary policy, essentially to help pay for 
substantial post-conflict expenses in areas such as humanitarian relief supplies, assistance to displaced 
persons, demobilization, and reconstruction of damaged physical assets. While private sector contributions, 
donor support and other sources can be expected to meet part of these extra spending needs, a big share of 
will be expected to be covered by government expenditure.  
 
• 
Conversely, multiple signals indicate that tightening is in order to address unwelcome strains and 
imbalances in the economy. High and rising inflation suggests some selected tightening of policies is in order, 
while public sector liabilities that slowly accumulate as prices for key staples—fuel, wheat, oil, utilities—are

72 
kept unchanged also imply a need for tightening.  Ethiopia’s debt position, although not posing a solvency risk, 
is also facing debt service challenges and these can be aggravated if resources are shifted substantially from 
repayments to reconstruction.  
 
How precisely the Government will balance these tensions is a key unknown. It is possible that a balanced and 
‘middle-of-the-road’ approach will be sought whereby some monetary tightening measures are put in effect (to address 
still-high inflation) while retaining a somewhat looser bias with respect to budgetary policies. In addition, to limit the 
burden on monetary policy, continued use of administrative measures (subsidies, price controls) may be given priority 
instead of monetary tools. On fiscal policy, while some degree of resort to higher deficits (versus pre-conflict norms) is 
to be expected, it is also likely that large reconstruction needs will be covered by cutting back on what were previously 
planned capital expenditure items (thus at the expense of, say, foregone road/irrigation/health/education projects). 
Thus one possible (and perhaps likely) approach is a combination of somewhat tighter monetary policy that is aided by 
continued administrative measures in combination with a budgetary stance that is looser than pre-conflict norms.  
 
External vs Domestic Financing: 
 
Reconstruction will require substantial net new resources and where such funding will be sought—from  domestic 
or external sources—is another key macro challenge for the upcoming year. Such decisions will affect the size and 
speed of resources that can be made available to fund reconstruction activities. Some key considerations here include:   
 
• 
Size of reconstruction funding needs: While there may be large reconstruction demands (as well as 
longstanding development needs) that will be identified in the coming year, in reality, it is likely the 
available supply of such funds that will—in the end—determine the scope of resources that can be 
devoted to reconstruction. Securing extra reconstruction-related financing amounts of say Birr 50bn, 
100bn, 250bn, and 500bn would roughly amount to 1%, 2%, 5% and 10% of GDP—or equivalent to $1bn, 
$2bn, $5bn, and $10bn in dollar terms. For perspective, the government’s annual budget this year is Birr 
547bn (equivalent to ~10% of current year GDP), while recent budget deficits, which indicate the 
government’s annual borrowing requirements, have averaged near 3 percent of GDP in recent years. 
Moreover, to put in context the funding needs in fx terms, grants inflows have averaged $1.5bn in the 
last five years (excluding FY 2020-21), external loans to government averaged $1.8bn per year, external 
loans to SOEs average $1.4bn per year, FDI averaged $3.3bn per year, and the stock of official fx reserves 
currently stands at around $2bn. Considering that any reconstruction funding should be seen as being 
additional to already occurring spending and deficit financing norms, a realistic size of additional and 
solely reconstruction-related funding that can be reasonably expected is perhaps on the order of 2-4 
percent of GDP (thus say Birr 100bn to 200bn, or $2bn to $4bn) for the immediate period ahead.  
 
• 
Domestic funding considerations: New credit creation was on the order of Birr 300bn last year, and this 
is—after allowing for some moderate growth— indicative of the extent of new loanable funds that can 
be created by the banking system in the immediate period ahead.  However, most of this is absorbed by 
loans going to government (to cover the budget deficit), to state enterprises, and to the private sector.   
Some non-bank domestic funding is already forthcoming and may continue in the year ahead, but 
amounts are unlikely to be large from a macro perspective; this includes grants or in-kind contributions 
from private entities, or exceptional  transfers by non Federal Government bodies such as municipalities 
or other public entities.  
 
• 
External funding considerations: Three main external funding sources that can be considered as largely 
directed towards assistance—official grants, loans to government, and private foreign transfers (e.g 
 
RESEARCH & ANALYTICS

73 
primarily NGO-type flows)—provided an annual average of about $4.4bn in funds per year prior to FY 
2020-21.1  This figure dropped to $3.4bn in FY 2020-21 but the trend lines for this fiscal year—up to 
December 2020—are pointing to the likelihood of even lower annualized levels of closer to $2.5bn-$3bn. 
Thus, just reverting back to the ‘normal’ assistance levels prior to 2020-21 would imply an additional $1bn 
to $2bn in external funding. The extent to which any such additionality and ‘ramp up’ can take place will 
be dependent on the speed and depth of Ethiopia’s re-engagement  with its external partners—including 
getting the right mix between bilaterals and multilaterals, donors vs lenders, official vs private funders, 
and traditional (‘Western’) vs non-traditional (Asian and Middle Eastern) partners.  
 
As is revealed by the above, the policy decisions on whether to rely on a largely domestic, largely external, or 
combined approach to reconstruction will determine the likely size and speed of near-term funding supplies. 
Excessive reliance on a domestically driven funding approach can use up most newly created domestic deposits/credits, 
thus leaving the local private sector squeezed out of financing and growth opportunities. At the same time, making 
greater use of external resources requires a much more active engagement with the relevant partners. All things 
considered, a balanced and pragmatic approach that moderates government’s use of domestic credit (to avoid private 
sector crowding out) while at the same time boosting the pool of external resources (via at least a partial return towards 
previous funding norms) does appear preferable and more clearly to the benefit of all stakeholders involved.  
 
Resource Allocations to Public vs Private Sectors—Credit and FX: 
 
The allocation of two vital resources—credit and foreign exchange—has not only tilted heavily towards the 
public sector in the past year (given its budgetary financing and forex needs) but also shows signs of continuing 
to do so for the coming year.  As highlighted earlier, as of September 2021, credit to Government rose 94 percent 
year-on-year vs just 17 percent year-on-year for the private sector. Seen differently, of the total credit creation in 
the year to September 2021, 43 percent flowed to the Government, 32 percent to SOEs, and 26 percent to the 
private sector. With respect to access to foreign exchange resources, a recent central bank directive increased the 
share of commercial banks’ fx inflows that are surrendered to the NBE (public sector) from an already high 50 
percent to 70 percent as of January 2022.  In short, unless current conditions change, the share of new credit and 
new fx flows going to the private sector would remain in the range of just 26 to 30 percent respectively.  
 
While the early signs at the start of 2022 regarding private sector credit/fx access are thus not encouraging, it 
is the case that the recent normalization of the political space may bring a reversal of these trends and NBE fx 
policies may change (yet again) to reflect evolving/improving conditions. It is also notable that the share of these 
two resources that can be expected by the private sector will itself be a function of broader choices taken on the 
stance of macro policy (tightening vs loosening) and on the relative use of financing sources (domestic vs external).  
To the extent that a moderate stance is adopted on policy tightening combined with greater efforts to capture 
foreign financing flows, this would help improve credit and fx flows to the private sector even under current 
conditions. 
 
 
 
1 This reflects the sum of five year average inflows (FY 2015-16 to FY 2019-20) from $1.8bn for loans to government, $1.5bn for official 
grants, and $1.1bn from ‘other private transfers’ (e.g NGO and related inflows).

Section 10: Our Baseline Macro Projections and an alternative scenario 
 
• Our baseline macro outlook takes the view that a growth slowdown is unavoidable this fiscal year (given developments 
in the last six-month period) but that a strong growth bounce back is almost inevitable next year, conditional on the 
assumption of a conflict de-escalation and return to normalcy across most sub-sectors.  
 
• Although an improvement in the political/policy landscape over the remaining six months of this fiscal year can be 
expected to partly reverse some of the adverse trends of the most recent six months, we expect any such changes will 
be gradual and that full-year outturns for 2021-22 will thus end up showing slower growth, higher inflation, a higher 
deficit, and a weaker external position compared to 2020-21.  
 
• In an alternate scenario involving a prolonged ‘stalemate’ or ‘low-level conflict’ scenario, it is to be expected that—
besides what will likely be lower/negative growth as well as continued high inflation—conditions for the private sector 
would be further aggravated by continued tightened access to credit and fx . Further strains are thus to be expected—
in this adverse scenario—on firms’ operational expansion, long-term growth, and job creation prospects. 
 
Underlying assumptions 
 
Our baseline macroeconomic projections assume—based on the direction of political and policy developments as of 
early 2022—that there is a continued de-escalation in the conflict, such that major active hostilities are no longer in 
place for the year ahead. Moreover, given recent initiatives, it is assumed that policies will soon begin to meaningfully 
address large humanitarian needs in all affected regions and that there is a gradual restoration of infrastructure links, 
commerce, and economic activity in what were conflict-affected zones. This assumed baseline is clearly a 
‘reconstruction scenario with no conflict’ and takes the (optimistic) assumption that there will be no reversals or 
backsliding on the political/conflict front. For illustrative purposes, an alternate scenario involving a prolonged low-
level conflict scenario (and where normalcy fails to return in farm activities, in infrastructure links, and in commerce) is 
also sketched out at the end of this Section, to highlight some of the implied macro impacts under that adverse case.  
  
Regarding the three policy tensions highlighted earlier (Section 9), we make the following judgements and 
assumptions on the likely direction of near-term policies. In particular, we assume policymakers will: (1) adopt a 
‘middle-ground’ position between tightening and loosening, with the remainder of the year marked by continued fiscal 
loosening alongside somewhat tighter monetary policy focused on inflation control; (2) aim to secure a gradual increase 
in external financing flows, even if the volume of such flows does not immediately revert to past norms; and (3) 
continue to allocate substantial fx resources to the public sector (thus maintaining the current 70% fx surrender 
requirement in the near-term) but enable a somewhat higher proportion of credit flows to go to the private sector as 
this will be increasingly possible with greater external financing becoming available to cover the wider budget deficits.  
 
Growth and economic activity 
 
For the current fiscal year ending in June 2022, we expect a deterioration in growth outturns in line with the 
observations of high frequency indicators for the most recent (July-December 2021) six month period. Most notably, 
we expect drops to be registered in crop production levels as well as lower growth rates to be recorded in areas such 
as construction, manufacturing, and some services. Our sector-specific views on prospects for the current fiscal year 
(2021-22) and for the upcoming fiscal year (2022-23) are summarized below:  
 
• Crops:  As the largest component of GDP, trends in crop output will dominate all other sectors and have the 
strongest bearing on the growth outlook. For this fiscal year, key considerations are: (1) the degree of damage

75 
to crop output in Tigray, Amhara, and Afar; and (2) the extent to which crop outturns in the ‘rest of the country’ 
have performed to offset losses in northern Ethiopia (including, for example, on account of recent low-land 
irrigation initiatives).  Based on a mix of regional government statements on crop losses, Ministry of Agriculture 
indications, and a review of the distribution of farmland by zones in Tigray and Amhara (see Figure 10.1), we 
think it is reasonable to expect crop losses of as much as 50 percent of previous year outturns in Tigray and as 
much as 20 percent losses in Amhara. Given their production levels in the year before the conflict, this implies 
crop output drops from 20.3mn to 10.1mn in Tigray and from 111mn quintals to 88mn quintals in Amhara. For 
the ‘rest of the country’, we assume this will follow recent trend growth of 5 percent, reflecting very favorable 
rains—per meteorology data—throughout the June-September 2021 rainy season and various on-going farm-
related initiatives (expanded irrigation, expanded fertilizer use, expanded cluster farming, and expanded use of 
modern machinery). Reflecting the above, we estimate the total crop output would show a drop of 6 percent 
this year, from last year’s 342mn quintals to around 320mn quintals, or roughly close to levels of two years ago.

• Construction: The second largest GDP sector shows signs of a slowdown in activity as gleaned from cement 
production, credit, and anecdotal data. Last year’s GDP data already showed much reduced growth in this sector, 
with output expanding at its slowest pace in ten years, from the 15-20 percent annual growth that was the norm 
a few years ago to just 6.6 percent in 2020-21. Credit to the sector rose by 22 percent as of June 2021, but this 
marks its lowest level in several years and is close to zero in real terms. More recently, during the July-December 
2021 period, the credit freeze imposed by NBE will have significantly affected new and on-going projects. Even 
allowing for some pick-up in activity in the January-June 2022 period, we would thus anticipate either flat or 
very marginal growth this fiscal year for the construction sector (the dominant part of the industry share of GDP). 
 
• Services: While some services activities have continued to show weakness versus pre-covid and pre-conflict 
norms, especially in tourism and hospitality sector, there are also notables areas of strength in airline services, 
banking, health and education. Some sub-segments of the economy also show growth simply because there is a 
modest recovery taking place from what were unusually low post-covid/post-conflict levels (e.g. monthly tourist 
inflows fell from a peak of 80,000 per month in mid-2019 to just 3,000 visitors in mid-2020, but are now back to 
near 30,000 per month, thus still well below previous highs but strong growth versus year-ago levels). We also 
expect that the public administration sub-component of services would register strong growth. Mid-single digit 
growth in this sector thus appears plausible, perhaps just slightly below last year’s 6.3 percent services growth.  
 
• Manufacturing: Though a very small share of the economy at less than 5 percent of total GDP, large scale 
manufacturing trends have shown growth in recent years at increasingly lower rates. Growth in this sub-sector 
was only 5.1 percent last year, down from growth rates of 8 percent in the two prior years, and 25 percent five 
years ago. Fx constraints, ease of doing business challenges, logistics disruptions/bottlenecks, and more recently 
the conflict are all likely to have contributed to the slowdown in growth. For this fiscal year, while industrial park 
activity (a sub-set of manufacturing) is growing strongly as of November 2021 (exports up 20 percent year-on-
year in dollar terms) we don’t expect that overall manufacturing growth would exceed last year’s and thus 
project it would likely be in the range of only 3-5 percent. This view is reinforced by indications from many  
companies producing fast-moving consumer goods, who are seeing drops in consumer demand from northern 
regions affected by conflict and thus likely to experience limited or no growth this fiscal year.    
 
• Mining: Although the fastest growing GDP sub-sector last year, with real growth of 115 percent, the tiny weight 
of this sub-sector (at just 0.5 percent of GDP) implies that there will not be a material impact on overall GDP 
figures, even with continued strong growth continuing into this year.  
 
All things considered, we project that GDP growth will be around just 1 percent for this fiscal year, but that there 
should be a strong bounce back in growth to near 7 percent in 2022-23. This year’s 1 percent projected growth reflects 
anticipated growth rates of -6 percent for agriculture, 4 percent for industry, and 5 percent for services, as well as their 
respective weights of 33%, 29%, and 38% in real GDP. For the upcoming 2022-23 fiscal year, the projection reflects 
expectations of crop output being restored in previous conflict zones, re-building works boosting construction activity, 
and higher external financing flows becoming realized alongside the on-going de-escalation in the conflict. With regular 
planting and harvesting activities restored in the agricultural sector, 6 percent growth in the crop sector is achievable, 
in our view, which would largely be just reverting output back to pre-conflict levels. For the industry sub-sector, which 
mainly consists of construction, a gradual improvement in credit conditions and the focus on re-building and re-
construction is expected to provide a boost to this sector and allow for growth in the 8-10 percent range. Similarly for 
services, it is reasonable to expect—in our view—a gradual expansion in key segments that were particularly affected 
by the conflict and covid (including tourism, hospitality) alongside what have already been growing sectors such as

77 
wholesale trade, banking, education, health and public administration. All considered, 2022-23 growth in the 7 percent 
(or more) range is achievable, in our view, conditional on the sector-specific improvements summarized above.  
 
Inflation  
 
The inflation outlook remains full of uncertainties. While it looked like inflation was on a downward course in recent 
months (given slight declines registered in the months of October and November), this trend was reversed in December 
2021 as a significant fuel price adjustment pushed inflation back up to 35 percent. In assessing the outlook, several 
notable near-term influences will be worth bearing:  
 
• 
Fuel price adjustment of December 2021: A substantial 25 percent adjustment in fuel prices was put in place in 
December 2021 (raising prices from Birr 25.86 to 31.74 per litre, or $0.53 to $0.64 per litre) and is likely to quickly 
filter through to many goods and services, including for transportation (~3% of the CPI index) as well as some 
food items. As such, it would be reasonable to expect another one or two months of elevated month-on-month 
overall price increases, especially since December 2021’s transport price sub-index (up 1.4% month-on-month) 
does not appear to have fully reflected yet the fuel pass price-through given delayed transport tariff 
adjustments.  Seen over the longer-term, given policy intentions to gradually remove fuel subsidies over the 
coming year, such step-up adjustments in the fuel price will continue to bring inflationary pressures, unless 
global oil prices drop materially from their current high levels ($88 per barrel as of January 2022, or up 60 percent 
from year ago’s level of $55 per barrel).  
 
• 
Past experience with disinflation: Taking a longer-term view, Ethiopia’s experience reducing inflation once it 
has surpassed 30% generally suggests an extended period of time is required to revert back to more moderate 
rates of inflation. Our review of 25 years of inflation data suggests once inflation exceeds 30 percent, it takes—
on average—16 months to fall back to 15 percent and 18  months to drop to single-digit levels. Given that the 
recent inflation spike crossed 30 percent in August 2021, past experience would (all else equal) suggest a decline 
to 15 percent inflation by roughly December 2022 and to single-digit inflation rates by February 2023. 
 
• 
Global commodity price developments: As external prices for key commodities contributed to this year’s high 
inflation, the outlook in this regard will also be important. The IMF’s WEO projections in this regard suggest 
prices will mostly trend downward (2022 vs 2021), and thus provide some moderate relief, for the four items 
that make up the largest shares in Ethiopia’s commodity imports: wheat prices are forecast by the IMF to rise by 
9 percent in 2022, but the forecasts for other large import items show anticipated declines for fuel (-2 percent), 
fertilizers (-4 percent), and vegetable oils (-5 percent).  
 
• 
Policy responses: The Government has so far sought to limit inflation by a range of measures that have included: 
raising reserve requirement on bank deposits (from 5% to 10%), instituting a temporary credit freeze on banks 
in the second half of 2021 (also justified by exchange rate considerations), subsidizing staple goods such as 
wheat and sugar, removing import duties/taxes on food items, and allowing franco valuta imports for certain 
imported foodstuffs (where importers are free to use their own externally secured fx funds rather than dollars 
from the banking system). Administrative measures (some COVID-related and others not) have included a freeze 
on rent increases and enforcement measures against merchants deemed to be engaged in “hoarding” or “price 
gouging” activities. Inflation has persisted despite all these measures, which partly raises questions about their 
effectiveness/adequacy, though it also the case that inflation might have been even higher yet had these actions 
not been in place. Looking ahead, it is likely that at least some sub-set of these measures will continue for most 
of 2022, or until inflation is firmly on a downward trajectory.

78 
Considering all of the above, we think it is reasonable to expect inflation remaining well into double-digit territory 
until the end of the next fiscal year. The very near-term outlook is likely to be dominated by December’s fuel price 
adjustment and we thus expect inflation will move up slightly higher and peak at about 35 to 37 percent rate as of end-
January 2022. Thereafter, based on month-on-month inflation rates of around 1.6 percent for each of the next six 
months (about 0.3 percentage points higher than historical medians to account for fuel price and conflict effects), we 
expect inflation can trend downwards to around 24 percent by June 2022; this seemingly optimistic drop is helped by 
large month-on-month inflation rates recorded this time last year (4% m-o-m in February 2021, 3% m-o-m in March 
2021, and 7% m-o-m in June 2021) that will all provide favorable base effects for this year’s inflation outturns in those 
respective months. For next fiscal year (2022-23), assuming a moderation in M2/credit growth (which is already evident 
in end-September’s M2 growth figures of 28 percent vs 30 percent at end-June), plus a recovery in crop output, plus 
no major price spikes in global commodity markets—all of which form part of our bassline macro scenario—inflation 
should drop to around 15 percent by December 2022 and further to the low teens by mid-2023.   
 
Fiscal position  
 
While the government budget deficit has been below 3 percent for several years, a materially higher deficit is now 
likely for 2021-22 on account of conflict related revenue shortfalls and higher-than-budgeted expenditure.  We 
estimate that the revenue outturn will be close to Birr 380bn and that external budgetary grants will only amount to 
Birr 15bn, for a total revenue and grants sum of Birr 396bn against anticipated budget expenditure of Birr 630bn (the 
latter reflecting the approved budget of Birr 122bn plus supplementary expenditure added during the year). The 
resultant deficit is thus expected to be around Birr 212bn, or close to 4 percent of GDP. 
 
The funds needed to cover this year’s budget deficit will need to come mainly from domestic sources (NBE, banks, 
pension funds), as supplies of foreign loans are down sharply this year. External loan financing is unlikely to exceed 
$500mn, or Birr 25bn,  this year, judging by the Q1 outturn (July-September 2021) of only $135mn or Birr 6bn.  The 
remaining Birr 187bn deficit (212bn less 25bn) will need to be funded from domestic sources and will not be helped by 
large privatization inflows this year as no large transactions are expected by June 2022. The resort to large domestic 
borrowing by the Government is already evident in high T-Bill issuances to date, which now stand at Birr 200bn at end 
December versus Birr 119bn from the start of the fiscal year (a six-month increase of Birr 81bn).  Further funding has 
been and will be forthcoming from the NBE as well, whose gross lending to government—per MOF debt data—already 
stood at Birr 312bn at end-September 2021, or up by Birr 30bn from the start of the fiscal year. Considering these year-
to-date financing trends (T-Bills up by Birr 81bn in the first six months and net credit from NBE up Birr 30bn in the first 
quarter), it is reasonable to expect the full year deficit reaching or slightly exceeding Birr 200bn (3.7% of GDP) for this 
fiscal year.    
 
For next fiscal year, 2022-23, a return to a somewhat improved fiscal position can be envisaged as external grants 
gradually pick up and revenue shocks dissipate. We assume revenue can reasonably grow by 20 percent reflecting 
nominal GDP expansion of 23 percent as well as on-going tax policy measures. On the expenditure side, we expect 
financing limitations will limit growth to around 20 percent. On this basis, the overall budget deficit should improve to 
3.1 percent of GDP and help keep the public debt level roughly unchanged from this year’s level of around 49 percent 
of GDP (thanks to a rising nominal GDP denominator).  
 
Monetary sector 
 
A moderate degree of monetary tightening has been initiated in the second half of 2021 and this is likely to be 
continue—in our view—until at least mid-2022, when inflation should have dropped by then closer to the 20-25 
percent range. Recent measures to tighten monetary policy have included a credit freeze enacted in July-December

2021 (subsequently removed) as well as an increase in reserve requirements from five to ten percent (since partially 
reversed). Mainly reflecting these actions, the first quarter of the fiscal year showed broad money growing by only 5 
percent quarter-on-quarter and 28 percent year-on-year (versus 30 percent y-o-y as at June 2021). The slowing growth 
is also reflected in banks’ deposit and lending data: deposits grew just 9 percent in the six months to December 2021 
(22 percent year-on-year) and loans grew 12 percent over the same six-month period (24 percent year-on-year).  
 
For 2022-23, a more accommodative monetary policy can be envisaged and would be reasonable, as food price trends 
should have moderated (with a return to normal harvests) and key supply-side constraints would be expected to have 
dissipated—both of which would allow the economy to expand further in a non-inflationary manner. We project that 
deposit growth would revert to the near 25 percent annual norm seen in recent years, and that credit growth would 
rise in tandem to register growth of 20-25 percent.  
 
External sector 
 
We expect balance of payments developments to show a mixed picture this year, but on a net basis end up showing 
a loss in fx reserves for the full fiscal year. Several components of Ethiopia’s forex inflows are showing unexpectedly 
strong growth this year, including for exports, remittances, and service receipts (the latter reflecting airline revenue, 
particularly expanded cargo operations). FDI is also on positive trend—given the circumstances—based on reported 
FDI registration figures for the first five months of the fiscal year ($1.1bn in July-November 2021, or up 28 percent from 
the same period last year). Offsetting these improvements, however, fx inflows from external partners are set to decline 
this year: funding from several bilateral donors has been paused (other than for humanitarian assistance) and 
multilateral lenders have also scaled back or suspended most of their funding. On  the trade side, AGOA-related impacts 
will exports somewhat, though this is unlikely to be in the magnitudes that are widely reported as only around $100mn 
of Ethiopia’s textile/leather exports to US are affected (while the single biggest export to the US—namely coffee—is 
still unaffected).2 In  addition, a debt service relief scheme (DSSI) that had been initiated to help countries respond to 
COVID has provided debt service relief up to end-2021, but its successor scheme (the Common Framework) and is yet 
to be implemented and is thus likely to delay any associated debt service relief in the very near-term (till June 2022). 
All in all, our balance of payments projections show an improvement in the current account deficit for this year (down 
to 2.7 percent of GDP, one of the lowest rates in a decade) but a weak capital account—essentially reflecting reduced 
foreign borrowing—contributing to a reserves loss for the year that will bring official fx reserves to a level of just below 
$2bn by end-June 2022.  
 
A more favorable external outlook can be envisaged for next fiscal year (2022-23), conditional on conflict de-
escalation and growing engagement with donors, creditors, trading partners, and investors. On specific BOP items, 
we anticipate the next fiscal year will show continued strong export growth (18%), rising remittances (up 12%), grant 
inflows of close to $1bn, and government borrowing of $1.4bn. For FDI, with the anticipated resumption of on-going 
privatization activities (part privatization of the telecom company, the issuance of a second telecom license, and the 
sale of sugar plants) inflows should be boosted substantially and potentially reach record levels of above $4bn. On the 
exchange rate, we expect that the still-high inflation rate in the immediate period ahead (and central bank efforts to 
avoid a real appreciation) will imply year-on-year depreciation rates of near 25 percent till mid-2022, followed by slower 
annualized rates of closer to 20 percent for H2 2022, and then annualized depreciation rates approaching the mid-
teens by early 2023 (on the back of moderating inflation). The exchange rates implied by these year-on-year 
depreciation rates would bring the currency to 54 Birr/USD by June 2022 and close to 57 Birr/USD by December 2022.      
 
2 The removal of AGOA privileges—if prolonged—is more significant from its signaling effects and potential adverse influence on the future 
FDI plans and re-location decisions of global firms. It is worth noting that offsetting measures—such as companies shifting sales to other 
countries or government temporarily supporting affected firms—can limit the potential loss in AGOA exports.

Conclusion 
 
Overall, our macro outlook takes the view that a growth slowdown is unavoidable this fiscal year (given 
developments in the last six-month period) but that strong growth bounce back is almost inevitable next year, 
conditional on the overarching assumption that there is conflict de-escalation in the immediate period ahead and a 
gradual return to normalcy in farm activities, in infrastructure links, and in commerce by mid-2022.  We would note 
that our expectations for next year’s growth bounce back also implicitly reflect the view—widely emphasized by 
policymakers as well as many observers—that the long-term fundamentals of the economy remain positive and firmly 
in place. Most notably, sector growth opportunities remain vastly under-exploited and will provide multiple growth 
poles for the Ethiopian economy (agriculture, mining, power, manufacturing, tourism) while policy reforms that have 
been either pledged or already in the pipeline should deliver more enabling/improving conditions across wide sections 
of the economy (via continued privatization, public sector improvement, ease of doing business reforms, 
financial/capital market liberalization, exchange rate liberalization, and digital economy initiatives). The policy 
framework and wide-ranging initiatives to be spear-headed under the Ten-Year Development Plan should further help 
in these directions, especially with a much more dedicated roll-out and intensified implementation to be forthcoming 
in the year ahead.

ALTERNATIVE MACRO SCENARIO FOR FY 2021-22 and 2022-23: 
 
While prospects are positive for a de-escalation of the conflict and a return to normalcy in many productive sub-
sectors (including crops, infrastructure links, and  commerce), there remains a small probability that Ethiopia faces 
a prolonged low-level conflict scenario with limited progress in the various assumed areas. The below summary 
highlights the opportunity costs involved with such a continued conflict scenario and also  presents a sense of the 
magnitudes involved.  
 
• Crops: With crop output in the two conflict-affected regions accounting for 38 percent of the national total 
(Amhara 32%, Tigray 6%), and assuming as much as a quarter/half of the affected regions show limited or no 
production, then potentially as much as 9.5%/19% of national crop output and hence around 2%/4% of GDP 
(given the crop sector’s 21 percent share in national GDP) is materially affected, with the corresponding loss 
in incomes, livelihoods, and welfare conditions that this entails.   
 
• Investment: The investment to GDP ratio in 2020-21 fell to its lowest level in years (28 percent of GDP), partly 
reflecting COVID and global factors, but also likely due to impacts of the conflict on both domestic and foreign 
investor sentiment. Reversing this decline—which is critical for long-term growth prospects—will clearly be 
more difficult under a conflict scenario. Investment-to-GDP ratios in the mid-30s range have characterized 
Ethiopia’s past period of strong growth and also remain a key target under the Ten-Year Development Plan.   
 
• Inflation: Inflation is up by 16 percentage points, from 19 percent to 35 percent, between the start of the 
conflict in November 2020 and now. Considering the time since the intensification/spread of the conflict (July 
2021), inflation is up by 10 percentage points (from 25% to 35%).  While many other factors are also at play, 
direct conflict related impacts—food supply shocks, transport disruptions, precautionary purchasing—can be 
expected to have accounted for at least several percentage points of this increment over the past year.   
 
• Fiscal position: Budget deficits may not necessarily worsen in a continued conflict scenario, as additional 
conflict-related expenditures have been met partly by cutbacks to previously planned spending (typically on 
capital expenditure ). Given the high share of capital spending in the budget (33% of total), this does provide 
significant leeway to re-allocate expenditure to conflict-related expenses; however, such re-allocations would 
be done at the expense of needed developmental investments in areas such as roads, health, and education.  
 
• External position: Multiple sources of foreign exchange will be impacted under continued conflict, including 
some portion of AGOA-related exports (~$100mn), tourism inflows (~1bn pre-conflict), and grants and loans  
to government (which fell to $1.2bn and $1.0bn respectively last year but showed $1.5bn and $1.8bn in 
average annual inflows respectively for the prior five years). FDI may not be immediately impacted, as appears 
to be the case so far, but longer term impacts on investor sentiment can materially reduce future flows.  
 
Overall, a near-term outlook involving either a ‘continued low-level conflict’ or a ‘prolonged stalemate scenario’ 
would involve much lower/negative growth, continued high inflation, possibly higher deficits, and a weaker 
external position on account of both lower ‘aid-related’ and private/FDI inflows. Most notably for the private 
sector, the tight conditions with respect to credit availability (reflecting greater domestic borrowing by the 
Government) and fx access (reflecting large surrender requirements on the private sector) would be aggravated 
from their current norms—implying even further strains on the operations and finances of private firms. Needless 
to say, Ethiopia can ill-afford any of these outturns taken individually; collectively and cumulatively the potential 
scale of foregone economic opportunities becomes that much more significant.

The latest GDP data from NPC uses FY 2015-16 as the base year and provides a five year time series from 2015-16 to 2019-20. 
Earlier GDP data use a different base year and thus not strictly comparable (thus series breaks between FY 2014-15 and 2015-16).
