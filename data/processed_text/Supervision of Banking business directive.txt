LICENSING AND SUPERVISION OF BANKING BUSINESS 
LARGE EXPOSURES TO COUNTERPARTY OR GROUP OF CONNECTED 
COUNTERPARTIES DIRECTIVE NO. SBB/87/2024  
 
Whereas, it’s crucial to set prudential limit that keep the maximum loss that a bank 
could face in the event of an unprecedented counterparty failure to a level below which 
the bank's financial soundness is not jeopardized;  
Whereas, it is important to ensure that banks have adequate policies and procedures 
in place to promptly detect, quantify, assess, track, report, and manage or reduce risk 
concentrations; 
Now, therefore, in accordance with article 22 (1) and article 66 (2) of the Banking 
Business Proclamation No. 592/2008 (as Amended by Proclamation No.1159/2019), 
the National Bank of Ethiopia has issued this Directive.

bank shall immediately communicate to the National Bank any breaches of 
the limit, and promptly rectify same. 
4.3   The National Bank, on grounds it may think sufficient, may prohibit a bank 
from extending any loan or advance to any person. 
 
5. Exclusions

all be exempted from the large exposure limits. This exemption shall apply also 
to a bank’s exposures to State/Federal Government- Owned Enterprises.  
5.2   Any portion of an exposure guaranteed by, or secured by the Government 
shall be similarly excluded from the scope of this Directive provided the

by the National Bank. 
5.3  Intraday interbank exposures.  
5.4   In stressed circumstances, the National Bank may accept a breach of limit 
during an interbank lending, after the transaction, to help ensure stability in 
the interbank market. 
 
6. Exposure Value 
 
For the purpose of this Directive: 
 
 
 
 
4 
6.1 a bank shall calculate the exposure value based on the book value of the 
exposure; 
6.2 off-balance sheet items shall be converted into credit exposure by applying the 
credit conversion factors set out in the National Bank Capital Adequacy 
Directive; and 
6.3 a bank, while computing the exposure value and determining compliance to 
the prudential limit required in this Directive, may consider and deduct cash 
collateral and cash substitutes.  
 
7. A Group of Connected Counterparties 
 
7.1 A bank that has exposures to a group of counterparties with specific 
relationships or dependencies such that where one of the counterparties was 
to fail, all other counterparties would very likely fail, shall be treated as a single 
counterparty and shall be subject to the exposure limits stipulated in this 
Directive. 
7.2 Two or more natural or legal persons shall be considered as a group of 
connected counterparties if at least one of the following criteria is satisfied: 
7.2.1 one of the counterparties, directly or indirectly, has control over the 
other(s); and 
7.2.2 one of the counterparties were to experience financial problems, in 
particular funding or repayment difficulties, the other(s), as a result, would 
also be likely to encounter funding or repayment difficulties. 
7.3 A bank shall assess the relationship amongst counterparties with reference to 
and shall establish the existence of a group of connected counterparties. 
7.4 In assessing whether there is a control relationship between counterparties, a 
bank shall automatically consider that criterion is satisfied if one counterparty 
owns more than fifty percent (50 %) of the voting rights of the other entity. 
7.5 A bank shall assess connectedness between counterparties based on control 
using the following criteria: 
7.5.1 voting agreements (including control of a majority of voting rights 
pursuant to an agreement with other shareholders); 
7.5.2 significant influence on the appointment or dismissal of an entity’s 
administrative, management or supervisory body, such as the board of 
directors, including the right to appoint or remove a majority of those 
members, or the fact that a majority of members have been appointed 
solely as a result of the exercise of an individual entity’s voting rights; and 
7.5.3 significant influence on chief executive officer or senior executive 
officers, including, when the entity has the power, pursuant to a contract 
 
 
 
5 
or otherwise, to exercise a controlling influence over the management or 
policies of another entity including through consent rights over key 
decisions. 
7.6 A bank shall refer to the criteria specified in appropriate internationally 
recognized accounting standards for further qualitative guidance when 
determining control. 
7.7 A bank may satisfactorily demonstrate that the counterparties in question do 
not, because of the control, form a group of connected counterparties, even 
in cases where control has been created in accordance with any of these 
principles and secure approval from the National Bank. 
7.8 A bank shall exercise caution while conducting transactions that attract 
connectivity based on economic interdependence. It shall consider, at the very 
least, the following qualitative factors: 
7.8.1 where fifty percent (50%) or more of one counterparty's gross receipts or 
gross expenditures (on an annual basis) is derived from transactions with 
the other counterparty including, the owner of a residential or commercial 
property and the tenant who pays a significant part of the rent; 
7.8.2 where one counterparty has fully or partly guaranteed the exposure of the 
other counterparty, or is liable by other means, and the exposure is so 
significant that the guarantor is likely to default if a claim occurs; 
7.8.3 where a significant part of one counterparty’s production or output is sold 
to another counterparty, which cannot easily be replaced by other 
customers; 
7.8.4 when the expected source of funds to repay the loans of both 
counterparties is the same and neither counterparty has another 
independent source of income from which the loan may be serviced and 
fully repaid; 
7.8.5 where it is likely that the financial problems of one counterparty would 
cause difficulties for the other counterparties in terms of full and timely 
repayment of liabilities; 
7.8.6 where the insolvency or default of one counterparty is likely to be 
associated with the insolvency or default of the other(s); and 
7.8.7 when two or more counterparties rely on the same source for the majority 
of their funding and, in the event of the common provider’s default, an 
alternative provider cannot be found – in this case, the funding problems 
of one counterparty are likely to spread to another due to a one-way or 
two-way dependence on the same main funding source. 
7.9 If a bank satisfactorily demonstrates to the National Bank that some of these 
criteria do not automatically imply an economic dependence i.e., when a 
 
 
 
6 
counterparty, which is economically closely related to another counterparty 
may overcome financial difficulties, or even the second counterparty’s default, 
by finding alternative business partners or funding sources within an 
appropriate time period, can become financially sound, the bank, after 
securing approval from the National Bank, may not need to combine these 
counterparties to form a group of connected counterparties.  
7.10 There 
are 
cases 
where 
a 
thorough 
investigation 
of 
economic 
interdependencies will not be proportionate to the size of the exposures. In 
such circumstances, a bank is expected to identify possible connected 
counterparties on the basis of economic interdependence in all cases where 
the sum of all exposures to one individual counterparty exceeds five percent 
(5%) of total capital. 
 
8. Reporting Requirement 
 
A bank shall submit to Banking Supervision Directorate of the National Bank 
reports showing month-end exposures of every single counterparty that 
exceeds ten percent (10%) of total capital of a bank, within twenty (20) days 
after the end of the period for which the data are reported. The report shall be 
submitted in accordance with Annex 1 attached herewith, which shall be part of 
this Directive. 
 
9. Policies and Procedures for Monitoring Large Exposures 
 
9.1  The board of directors shall ensure that the bank has a board-approved policy 
and management has also put in place procedures governing large exposures 
and risk concentrations. The board shall ensure the policy is reviewed regularly 
and it remains adequate and appropriate. The policy shall, at a minimum, 
incorporate: 
9.1.1 exposure limits; 
9.1.2 the process for identifying, measuring, evaluating, monitoring, controlling 
and reporting large exposures and risk concentrations of the bank. 
9.1.3 stress testing and scenario analysis of the bank’s large exposures and risk 
concentrations to assess the impact of changes in market conditions and 
key risk factors including. economic cycles, interest rates, liquidity 
conditions or other market movements on its risk profile, capital, and 
earnings; and 
9.1.4 conduct of regular independent reviews to verify on-going compliance 
with the prudential limit and standards set by the National Bank. 
 
 
 
7 
9.2 A bank shall ensure it has adequate processes and controls in place to monitor 
exposures that are exclusions as per Article 5 of this Directive. A bank shall 
consider how the risks arising from these types of exposures are incorporated 
into its risk management framework.   
 
9.3 A bank shall have appropriate limits in place aimed at constraining its exposures 
to large single or connected counterparties. In setting such limits, specific 
considerations shall be given to the:  
9.3.1 prevailing statutory and prudential limits on exposure to a single 
counterparty; 
9.3.2 quality of the bank’s processes for its management of credit concentration 
risk; and  
9.3.3 bank’s risk-taking capacity including its capital and liquidity position. 
 
9.4 A bank shall implement processes for clearly communicating and articulating 
the nature and frequency of reporting to the board and senior management. 
9.5 A bank shall establish and maintain adequate systems that can identify, 
measure, monitor and aggregate exposures to single counterparties in a 
timely manner. 
 
10. 
Transition Period  
 
A bank which, due to the revisions made thereof, is not in compliance with the 
requirements of this Directive shall submit an action plan within ninety (90) days 
after this directive enters into force, to bring down its excess exposures 
according to this Directive within a maximum of three (3) years from the 
effective date of this Directive.    
 
11. Repeal 
 
Credit Exposures to Single and Related Counterparties Directives No. SBB/53/2012 is 
hereby repealed and replaced by this Directive. 
 
12. Effective Date  
 
This Directive shall enter into force as of 12th day of June 2024.
