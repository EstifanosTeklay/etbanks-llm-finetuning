Ethiopia’s auction-based Treasury Bills Market turned one-year old this month.       
In this period, private banks and pension funds supplied Government with close to 
Birr 95bn in financing—equivalent to $3bn or 3% GDP—to help cover the budget 
deficit. Based on data from all 27 auctions that took place this past year, we present 
trends in T-Bill volumes, maturities, prices, and yields. We also offer our views on 
the auction market’s early successes, emerging issues, and what might be expected 
in the year ahead now that this ‘test-run’ for the introduction of full-fledged capital 
markets has firmly established itself in Ethiopia’s financial sector. 
 
§ Background: Ethiopia’s T-Bill auctions were set up in December 2019 as the first step in 
the establishment of market-based debt and equity markets that eventually cover both 
the public and private sectors. The auction market was a departure from Government’s 
past practice of relying on mandatory NBE Bills issued at pre-determined interest rates.  
 
§ Auction Volumes: Gross T-Bill issuance has reached Birr 95bn (~3% of GDP) to date, or 
a net of Birr 57bn after accounting for redemptions. T-Bills now make up 9% of govern-
ment domestic debt. For private banks, T-Bills make up roughly 4% of their total lending. 
 
§ Maturity mix: Although 28-day T-Bills were dominant at first, the 182-day Bills now 
make up the bulk (64%) of new T-Bill issues, while 28-day T-Bills are just 5% of the total.  
Per Government efforts to extend maturities, a 365-day T-Bill was successfully sold for 
the first time in December 2020, though this is so far only a tiny share of total T-Bills. 
 
§ Prices and Yields: With a par value of Birr 100, T-Bills are sold at prices that reflect a 
discount to their face value (thus in the range of 92 to 99 cents). Recent yields on the 
28-day, 91-day, 182-day, and 364-day T-Bills were 5.2%, 6.7%, 6.8%, and 8.7% 
respectively. The effective cost of borrowing for Government (from T-Bills) is now 6.5%.   
 
§ Early successes, emerging issues, and outlook: The T-Bill market has successfully 
replaced mandatory NBE bills (boosting credit to the private sector), become a reliable 
means of covering budget deficits, improved returns to participating savers/investors 
(pension funds and private banks), and established for the first time a benchmark yield 
curve for public and private securities. At the same time, the T-Bill market’s substantially 
negative real rates, low voluntary private sector participation, and a still-pending 
secondary market are areas of concern that will hopefully either recede in 2021 (with 
declining inflation) or be addressed via further reform. Looking ahead, the T-Bill auction 
experience could help the central bank put in place similar instruments—such as 
monetary policy bills—that help control inflation and better manage banking system 
liquidity,  while on-going efforts to sell longer-dated T-Bills should assist Government 
extend the maturity of its domestic debt. For the private sector, the broadly positive 
early experience with the T-Bill market brings with it much stronger prospects for the 
emergence of added debt & equity capital markets, including: (a) bond issuance by 
private firms and banks; (b) equity issuance by private firms and banks (via a stock 
market); and (c) the eventual inclusion of foreign investors—like in most of Africa’s 
largest economies—that allows for an even broader and deeper pool of funding sources.

181mn in 28-day T-Bills, Birr 1,796mn in 91-day T-bills, and Birr 1,913mns in 182-day T-Bills at the 27 
sessions conducted over the past year. 
§ 
As of December 2020, around Birr 7bn worth of T-Bills is being sold—at each auction session—to private 
banks and pension funds for the purpose of funding the Government’s budget deficit.

TOTAL BILLS ACCEPTED: 
 
§ 
The composition of T-Bills sold was mostly dominated by the shorter maturity T-Bills in early 2020, but 
this has changed notably since then, with longer maturies (six-month T-Bills) now much more dominant. 
§ 
The share of six-month T-Bills (182-days) is now 64 percent of new T-Bills sold, versus 31 percent for 
three-month T-Bills, and just 5 percent for one month T-Bills. 
§ 
Besides the three main maturities, a 365-day T-Bill was sold for the first time on December 16, 2020.

BILL ISSUANCE, REDEMPTION, AND NET OUTSTANDING LEVELS:  
 
§ 
Given the short maturity of T-Bills issued so far, around Birr 15bn in T-Bills are falling due for 
repayment each month, requiring equally large (or more) new issues to keep net T-Bill financing 
unchanged or rising.   
§ 
Monthly issuance has reached as high as Birr 20bn recently, while the net outstanding stock of T-Bills 
was near Birr 57bn as of December 2, 2020.

BID-COVER RATIOS: 
 
§ 
The bid-cover ratio, which shows total demand by bidders relative to the amount of T-Bills offered, 
has generally been above 100 percent and was rising for most of the year, indicating sufficient market 
demand for investing in the T-Bills. 
§ 
Seen by maturity, T-Bill buyers show a stronger preference for short-term instruments (where the bid-
cover ratio is above 150%) rather than longer-term T-Bills (which show just a 55% bid-cover ratio).

T-BILL YIELDS: 
 
§ 
Taking a year-long view, 28-day T-Bill yields have averaged 5.9%, 91-day T-Bills have averaged 6.4% 
and 182-day T-Bills have averaged 7.0%. The first 364-day T-Bill issued recently offers a yield of 8.7%. 
§ 
In general, yields have trended downward over time, which partly reflects a high starting point in 
early 2020 as participants were still becoming familiar with the market and, more recently, a banking 
system showing high liquidity following the September 2020 currency conversion.

EFFECTIVE COST OF BORROWING FOR GOVERNMENT: 
 
§ 
Reflecting movements in T-Bill yields and the changing composition of T-Bills by maturity, the cost 
of Government borrowing via the T-Bills varied from a low of 5% to a high of 7.2% over the past year.  
§ 
On average, the Governement’s effective cost of borrowing via T-Bills was 6.4 percent over the 
course of 2020.

A BENCHMARK YIELD CURVE AND THE UNIVERSE OF GOVERNMENT SECURITIES: 
 
§ 
With T-Bills of four different maturities now offered in the market, the Government has for the 
first time established a benchmark yield curve for government and other debt, with an annualized 
yield of 5.9% for one-month debt and 8.7% for one-year debt.  
§ 
The T-Bill market is one of about seven other public sector securities now in the market, including 
the Eurobond, GERD bonds, SOE bonds, Regional Government bonds, and recently created T-
Notes and Government bonds (the latter two reflecting a re-packaging of earlier debts).

KEY INTEREST RATES AND INFLATION: 
 
§ 
T-Bill rates have—over the course of 2020—moved towards the minimum 7 percent savings rate 
provided by banks, but are still below rates seen for GERD bonds (8 percent) and also stand below 
the average lending currently charged by banks (14 percent).   
§ 
Real returns after accounting for inflation are still substantially negative, at about 12 percentage 
points, reflecting 19% year-on-year inflation and a 7% yield on 182-day T-Bills.

ETHIOPIA’S T-BILLS IN A CROSS-COUNTRY CONTEXT: 
 
§ 
Compared to T-Bill markets in other African countries, Ethiopia stands out for its low average 
yield despite a macroeconomic environment with much higher inflation.  
§ 
Ethiopia remains one of the few large African economies where real T-Bill rates and real deposit 
rates are both substantially negative, to the detriment of savers/investors in these instruments.

T-BILLS AND OVERALL GOVERNMENT DOMESTIC DEBT: 
 
§ 
T-Bills are still only a small part of the universe of Government debt,  and thus have considerable 
room to grow over the coming years.  
§ 
As of September 2020, T-Bills comprised 9 percent of total domestic debt, while 51 percent of 
such debt reflected Government bonds (mostly held by NBE) and 33 percent reflected Treasury 
Notes (mostly held by pension funds). 
§ 
The majority of T-Bills are still bought by pension funds rather than private banks. However, 
this has been changing somewhat over time: only 25% of T-Bills were purchased by private 
banks as of June 2020, but this share has risen to 33% of all T-Bills as of September 2020.

T-BILLS: EARLY SUCCESSES, EMERGING ISSUES, AND PROSPECTS FOR PERIOD AHEAD 
 
§ With the Treasury Bill auctions now in place for a full year, the summary below reviews the overall market’s 
early successes, emerging issues, and what might be expected in the year ahead now that this ‘test-run’ for the 
introduction of full-fledged capital markets has firmly established itself in Ethiopia’s financial sector. 
 
Figure 12: Treasury Bills: Early Successes, Emerging Issues, and Prospects for Period Ahead
Area
Issue
End of 
Mandatory 
NBE Bills
The end of NBE Bills, which had reached near Birr 95bn at end-2019 (equal to 24% of bank deposits and 30% percent of 
their total loans), has helped boost credit flows to the private sector this past year. The majority of new  credit extended 
by banks is now flowing to the private sector, i.e., 61% of extra credit creation as of September 2020.
Ethiopia now has--for the first time--a market determined yield curve, with benchmark interest rates established for 1-
month, 3-month, 6-month and 1 year securities. Corporate bond issues can now be priced off this benchmark yield curve.
As of December 2020, the upward sloping yield curve showed rates rising in line with maturities: 5.2% for one-month T-
Bills, 6.7% for three-month T-Bills, 6.8% for six-month T-Bills, and 8.7% for twelve-month T-Bills. 
Still negative 
real rates
Due to still-high inflation rates of near 19 percent, real returns to buyers of Govt T-Bills are in the order of -12 percent and 
thus still unattractive compared to other alternatives (which would include, for example, lending to private companies for 
banks and investing in time deposits for the pension funds). Given likely declines in inflation, the current negative real 
returns may be a temporary issue and T-Bill investors could be looking forward to gradually improving net real returns, but 
the longer the real negative rates remain in place, the more there will be reluctance to stay engaged in the T-Bill market.
Mandatory 
obligations
The removal of mandatory NBE Bill purchases was a positive reform, but recent regulations that require minimum T-Bill 
purchases by certain private entities (such as insurance companies) are moving away from the spirit and direction of the 
earlier reform. With attractive market conditions in the T-Bill auction, such mandatory requirements should not be 
necessary and would not distort the proper pricing and functioning of the auction market. 
Extending Maturities: After a couple of unsuccessful starts, the first 364-day T-Bill was successfully issued on Dec 16 2020, 
which bodes well for eventually also offering longer term securities of, say, 3, 5, and 10-year durations. 
Broadening the investor base: With falling inflation over the course of 2021, real returns could become attractive enough 
to bring private savers/investors into the T-Bill market.  For example, as of Sep 2020, Birr 66bn of time deposits were held 
at banks typically locked in for periods of 1 or two years.  This is a potential funding base for even longer-dated T-Bills.
Current T-Bills are solely a government fund-raising exercise, with NBE conducting the auction as an agent of Government.  
Since banks still hold a limited absolute stock of T-Bills, the ability to use them to help conduct monetary policy objectives 
(i.e. selling more bills to withdraw banking system liquidity, or buying up past bills to inject liquidity) is very constrained. 
In most other developing countries, there exist a separate set of Monetary Policy Bills that the central bank can use at its 
own initiative and for monetary policy (liquidity management) purposes. This allows the central bank to issue such bills to 
withdraw liquidity and to buy them back to inject liquidity for banks.  Although such instruments may be addressed in the 
NBE's Financial Sector Road Map, an early introduction of such Monetary Policy Bills could--in the interim--help better 
manage inflation and banking sector liquidity conditions
Equity Markets 
for private 
issuers
With the recent approval of a Stock Market Proclamation, conditions are being put in place for the eventual start of equity 
capital markets, including the trading of already existing shares of share companies (mainly banks and insurance 
companies) and the issuance of new private company shares. However, given the still early stages of many key pre-
requisites--such as regulatory authorities, trading platforms, depository systems--the launch of this market seems more 
likely in 2022 than 2021.The ECX platform (whose legal framework now allows it to trade securities) could potentially be 
used to allow for an expedited launch of a trading platform and associated market infrastructure. 
Source: Cepheus Research summary. Based on World Bank's "Financial Sector Development" document (on WB website), policy announcements, and press reports.
Significant amount of funds, Birr 95bn in gross terms, mobilized within just one year and a dedicated means of funding 
now established for covering budget deficits. Gross amount of funds amounts to 3 percent of GDP, or equal to the size of 
recent budget deficits.  Net T-Bill issuance was only around Birr 57bn as of Dec 2020, but even this is near 1.5% of GDP 
and close to the annual domestic  budget financing requirements, which recently averaged 1.8% of GDP. 
Rates on T-Bills have risen from 1-2 percent to a range of 6-7 percent over the past year, a significant improvement for 
private banks and pensions funds. With pension funds subject to mandatory obligations to invest in government securities, 
the improved interest rates on their T-Bill investments strengthens their ability to cover future retiree obligations. 
Most of the funding raised at the T-Bill market remains sourced from government-run pension funds and not truly private 
buyers. As of September 2020, only one-third of T-Bills were purchased by private banks, suggesting comparatively lower 
interest from the private sector. This, in turn, reflects the still-negative real returns noted above and, if unaddressed, could 
undermine longer-term investor interest in the government debt market.
Banks are currently buying T-Bills and holding them to maturity (which is not yet a serious issue given the short-term 
maturities). However, as a greater share of T-Bills issued are of one-year maturity or above, making it possible for holders 
to sell their T-Bills via an active secondary market becomes more significant and its establishment thus more critical. 
With a Bills/Bond market for Government debt now established, the road is now open for private debt issuers to access 
funds from the public in a similar fashion. The most likely such issuers are large corporates and local banks, who could 
issue--as regulations come in place--debt securities in which they borrow from the public by issuing say, one-year and 
three-year bonds that give them slightly better rates than they could get from bank borrowing (thus say in the low teens).
At present, foreign participation in the T-Bill market is prohibited, and rules are not in place guiding non-FDI  external 
capital flows into portfolio assets such as Bills, Bonds, and listed Equities. Foreign funding into debt and equity markets--
with the appropriate safeguards and limits--would provide net new external funds to these markets, as available funding 
would otherwise be only in local currency and reflect just shifts from certain local financial assets (say cash in circulation 
or existing bank deposits) into debt and equity markets.  A gradual opening to foreign savers/investors serves the purpose 
of expanding the total pool of (forex) funds available to domestic businesses beyond available domestic savings.
