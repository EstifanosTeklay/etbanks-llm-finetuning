Banking Industry Risk Management Survey Report 
National Bank of Ethiopia   
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) plans to move towards risk based supervision of 
banks. International experience suggests that such a move presupposes enhanced 
supervisory reliance on work of third parties, including that of banks. For improved 
reliance on work of third parties, supervisors need to ensure existence of strong risk 
management practice in supervised banks.   
 
To this end, the NBE conducted, in November 2009, its first bank risk management 
survey. Nine staffs1 of the Bank contacted all the 15 banks in the industry with a 
questionnaire to be completed.  
 
The survey aimed to identify status of risk management practices by banks and to put 
forward recommendations to address weaknesses. 
 
The rest of this report2 has three sections. The second section presents ‘executive 
summary’, 
the 
third 
‘detailed 
findings’, 
and 
the 
fourth 
‘conclusion 
and 
recommendations’.

Finally, the NBE would like to thank all the banks who participated in the survey. 
 
II. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
Results of banking sector risk management survey suggest existence of some positive 
steps taken so far by banks to strengthen their risk management practices. For instance, 
bank boards have given fairly adequate attention to risk management, risk management 
function has qualified staffs, risk management policies and procedures are in place, and 
business continuity/contingency plans exist for operational and liquidity risks. However, 
as detailed hereunder, weaknesses dominate banking sector risk management practices 
and thus indicate some supervisory concerns.   
 
i. Board responsibility   
 Full/part of board members in 87% of banks did not sit for training on risk 
management.   
 60% of banks’ boards of directors are not provided with relevant and up-to-date 
economic, business and market data for informed decision-making.   
 
ii. Structure and resources  
 Specific budget allocated to risk management function in 75% of banks is either 
relatively insignificant (0.14-0.43% of total budget), or unknown.  
 In 73% of banks, only part or none of the staffs were trained in risk management. 
 
iii. Strategies, policies and programs 
 60% and 74% of banks have not yet documented risk management strategy and 
program, respectively. 
 50% or above of banks lack timeframe to periodically review risk management 
documents.

 Risk management policies of 60% of banks do not define risk limits, & 93% of the 
rest either rely only on NBE limits for counterparty, or above 3/4th of them did not 
define limits at all for geography, product, security, sector, etc.  
 
iv. Communication 
 Internal communication of risk appetite and findings is low in 60% of banks. 
v. Appraisal and reward 
 Risk management process, in the vast majority (87%) of banks, is either partly or 
fully not integrated with HR management and policies.   
 
vi. Benefits and outcomes 
 No weakness. 
 
vii. Auditors 
 77% of external auditors and 60% of internal auditors of banks do not 
independently review effectiveness of banks’ risk management functions.    
 
viii. Risk identification and preparedness 
 Risk management function of 93% of banks does not capture risks related to 
procurement and HR. 
 87% of banks do not conduct workshop to identify risks in each activity/product, 
60% of them have not created risk register, and 87% of them do not exercise stress 
testing as a risk management tool. 
 93% of banks do not have continuity/disaster recovery/contingency plan in place for 
other risks like market, reputation, etc.  
 
ix. Nature of risks facing banks 
 Credit, operational and liquidity risks were key bank risks over the last two years, 
and will continue to be so over the next five years. 
 
Recommendations

To strengthen banks’ risk management: i) the NBE should review the existing risk 
management guidelines and issue them to all banks; ii) banks should be required to 
produce risk management programs acceptable to the NBE by giving due attention to 
credit, operational and liquidity risks; and iii) the NBE should design and implement 
short-term training programs to banks’ board members and risk management staffs.

 Majority of banks’ boards of directors have defined terms of reference for risk 
management, are aware of risk management requirements expected from them by 
the NBE, use risk management as a standing agenda item, spend fairly adequate 
time on and engage sufficiently with issues related to risk management.  
 
 Nevertheless, full/part of board members in 87% of banks did not sit for training on 
risk management, suggesting an urgent need for risk management capacity building 
of board members; and  
 Similarly, 60% of bank boards were not provided with relevant and up-to-date 
economic, business and market data for wise decision-making, implying a need for 
further work in strengthening management information system especially within the 
context of risk management.      
 
     
ii. Structure and resources 
Banks were asked nine questions under this heading. Purpose of these questions was to 
assess whether risk management function has received proper leadership, resources, 
monitoring system, etc 
                                                                                                                     “Yes” responses

Findings: 
 
 
 Most banks responded that they have delegated risk management function, assigned 
relatively qualified risk management staffs to the function, and exercise risk 
reporting and deliberations.   
 
 However, budget earmarked for risk management in 75% of banks is either 
relatively insignificant (0.14-0.43% of total budget), or the amount set aside is 
entirely unknown, suggesting that the function is largely overlooked; and  
 
 Meanwhile, in 73% of banks, either only part of risk management staffs were 
trained in risk management areas, or no staff was trained at all, implying an 
immediate need for steps to be taken to bring all risk management staff on board.  
 
iii. Strategies, policies and programs  
 
Using five questions under this heading, our objective was to review whether banks have 
documented appropriate strategies, policies and programs related to risk management.

Findings: 
 
 
 It is encouraging to see that policies and procedures are documented by majority of 
banks. However, 60% and 74% of banks have not yet documented risk management 
strategy and program, respectively. This suggests inadequate performance of board 
and senior management in these particular areas; 
 Majority of banks having strategies, policies, programs and procedures related to 
risk management, have also secured approvals on the documents from relevant 
authorities. Also, it is good that majority of banks responded that they review their 
risk management policies annually, every 2 or 5 years. Nevertheless, 50% or above 
of banks responded that they review risk management strategy, program and 
procedure, “as required”; meaning, they lack timeframe to review the documents, 
limiting a proper means for accountability and control; and  
 
 Unfortunately, there is general weakness in terms of defining appetite for risk. 
Majority (60%) of banks responded that their risk management policies do not 
define and quantify the appetite for risk, suggesting limited aspect of risk control. 
Even the vast majority (93%) of those 40% of banks who claimed to have policies 
with defined risk limits/tolerances, just use NBE limits for counterparties (single, 
related, etc) without having their own, or more than 3/4th of them failed to define 
limits for geography, product, security, sector and others. It is, therefore, imperative 
that there is an urgent need for further work in these areas. 
 
iv. Communication      
                                                                                                                                      
Banks were asked three questions under this heading to provide information on how risk 
management policies and practices were communicated internally. 
                                                                                                                                     
        “Yes” responses

v. Appraisal and Reward   
                                                                                                           
The intent of asking banks a question under this caption is to know to what extent the risk 
management process of banks is integrated with their HR management and policies 
including appraisal and reward systems.

The purpose of asking banks a couple of questions, under this heading, is to assess if 
banks appreciate benefits of risk management and whether they benchmark their process 
against external standards.  
 
 
 
 
“Yes” responses  
27. On scale 1 (low) to 5 (high), to what extent does risk management

Findings: 
 
 
 
 
 77% and 60% of banks responded that external auditors and internal auditors, 
respectively, have not reviewed effectiveness of their risk management process. 
viii. Risk identification and preparedness  
 
With the following six questions under this title, our attempt was to evaluate whether

IV. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
Results of survey suggest existence of some positive steps so far taken by banks to 
strengthen their risk management practices. These include: preparation of terms of 
reference for risk management, creation of risk management awareness, considering risk 
management as an agenda item and allotting adequate time for its deliberations by 
majority of bank boards.  
 
Also, in large proportion of banks, risk management is delegated, risk management staffs 
are qualified, risk management findings regularly reported, risk management policies and 
procedures are developed and approved, risk management practice is benchmarked, risks 
in products/activities are captured, business continuity/contingency plans exist for 
operational and liquidity risks. 
 
On the other hand, this survey unveiled a number of risk management weaknesses. 
Significant proportion of banks lack: training for board/risk management staff, up-to-date 
and relevant data for informed decisions, adequate risk management budget, risk

management strategies and programs, timeframe to review risk management documents, 
risk limits, risk communication, risk management integration with HR management and 
policies, risk management audit review, and initiatives to identify risks.  
 
Moreover, greater part of banks failed to capture risks related to procurement and HR, to 
create risk register, exercise stress testing, to put in place tools to effectively mitigate 
other risks like market and reputation.    
 
To strengthen banks’ risk management: i) the NBE should review the existing risk 
management guidelines and issue them to all banks; ii) banks should be required to 
produce risk management programs acceptable to the NBE by giving due attention to 
credit, operational and liquidity risks; and iii) the NBE should design and implement 
short-term training programs to banks’ board members and risk management staffs.
