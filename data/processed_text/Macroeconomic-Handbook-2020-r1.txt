As 2020 unfolds, Ethiopia’s political calendar is bringing an uncertain 
and unsettled environment to the economic outlook for the coming 
year. Amid this state of affairs, we decided to take stock of the many 
positive developments and hopeful trends emerging in Ethiopia’s 
macroeconomic environment at the start of the year. While recognizing 
key risks, this note focuses on the wide range of recent reforms and 
upcoming initiatives whose significance is often fast forgotten or 
inadequately appreciated. Beyond highlighting what we see as the 
economy’s bright spots, we present also our latest Quarterly 
Macroeconomic Review and our economic forecasts—covering the real, 
monetary, fiscal, and external sectors—for 2020 and 2021. 
 
1. A Major Threshold Crossed: Ethiopia’s per capita income passes $1,000 this year.  
2. Development Policy: Not all State and not all Market… as it should be. 
3. Macroeconomic Policy: Now more disciplined, more coherent, and more transparent.  
4. Government and State Enterprise Finances: Putting a proper price on borrowed money. 
5. Investment in the economy: Some sub-components are stalling but still high levels overall. 
6. Credit to the Private Sector: At record levels—and the types and terms are improving. 
7. Multilateral and Bilateral Partners: Ethiopia is now on top of most priority lists.  
8. Privatization: Inflows will start in 2020, and should exceed $5 billion within three years. 
9. Exchange Rate and FX Supplies: A realistic rate for the Birr not yet in place, but is on the horizon. 
10. Financial Sector Reforms : A slow start so far, but prospects look good for 2020 and 2021.

Ethiopia Macroeconomic Handbook 2020—EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
1. 
A Major Threshold Crossed: Ethiopia’s per capita income has just crossed $1,000 this year, based on an 
expected US dollar GDP of $109.5bn for FY 2019-20 (3,422bn in Birr terms) and a population count—per official 
statistics—of just above 100 million. In PPP terms, average incomes have reached $2,750 per capita. With the rise 
in incomes, total consumer spending ($66bn) is now fourth highest in absolute terms in Sub-Saharan Africa. And 
focusing just on urban consumers, their aggregate spending is near Birr 450bn ($16bn), by our estimates, which is 
propelling demand for fast-moving consumer goods, housing, transport, and a range of domestic services. Taking a 
cross-country perspective and reviewing the record of other countries that crossed $1,000 in per capita income (this 
occurred just 19 years ago in China, 13 years ago in India/Vietnam, and 7 years ago in Bangladesh/Kenya), we see 
that growth can continue at its recent pace as long as it is supported by high investment, and that Ethiopia could 
reach a $2,000 per capita income (~$5,100 per capita in PPP terms) within the space of seven years. 
 
2. 
Development Policy: Current economic reforms are being viewed by some as a major shift towards neo-
liberal, free-market policies and yet by others as still reflecting state-led and state-dominated policies. Neither 
perspective fully captures the reality, in our view, and policies seem to us to be moving (appropriately) towards a 
mixed and pragmatic approach that seeks to put in place both a strong state and a strong private sector. We think 
the economy will—for the foreseeable future—show four main economic actors each having over-sized roles in 
their specific spheres: government and state enterprises continuing to deliver most public goods; a dominant state 
bank providing the lion’s share of credit (though increasingly serving private sector clients and doing so alongside a 
growing pool of private banks); a growing domestic private sector—both SMEs and corporates—active primarily in 
agriculture, trading, services, and construction; and a foreign private sector increasingly dominant in large-scale 
manufacturing, industrial exports, mining, and specialized agricultural and agro-processing ventures.  
 
3. 
Macroeconomic Policy: With a well-articulated ‘Homegrown Economic Reform Plan’ in place alongside the 
support of an IMF financing arrangement, macroeconomic policies in 2020 will be the most disciplined, coherent, 
and transparent seen in years. The recent start of WTO entry negotiations—and an expected accession next year—
will further help put in place rules-based and predictable economic and financial policies. On macro policies, tighter 
discipline is evident from stricter financial controls now governing not just the government but also—as important—
the central bank and state enterprises. More coordination is being seen with tighter fiscal policies, monetary 
restraint, and a faster pace of exchange rate adjustment all working in parallel to (temporarily) restrain aggregate 
demand—while being supplemented with structural and sector-specific reforms to boost longer-term supply 
responses. And in terms of transparency, a range of economic policy commitments are being disclosed for greater 
awareness by the public, private sector, and foreign investors (per, for example, the 23 specific actions laid out in 
the Finance Minister and Governor’s recent Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies).  
 
4. 
Government and State Enterprise Finances:  For the first time in decades, the Government is moving away 
from funding itself almost exclusively via cheap and ‘captive’ sources and beginning to borrow at rates that better 
reflect the true cost of credit. Market-based T-Bills launched at end-2019 have—in just three months—already 
provided nearly Birr 3bn in funding (from private banks) and interest rates have moved upwards to 7-8 percent 
(similar to savings deposits) versus the rates of 1-2 percent prevalent before. While this move is of course more 
costly for government, the greater resort to market-based T-Bills will help impose a hard budget constraint and is 
significant in laying the foundation for the establishment of broader (private) debt and capital markets.

5. 
Investment in the economy:  Despite a slowdown in some sub-components, investment remains at a high 
35 percent of GDP per official FY 2018-19 data. The recent slowdown in FDI—per BOP data—has not brought down 
overall investment levels given the still limited share of FDI in total investment (~10 percent) and an offset provided 
from domestic private investors. Seen from a five-year perspective, two positive trend lines remain in place: there 
is a rising share of private investment and an increasing reliance on domestic savings. Looking ahead, FDI should 
recover in 2021 (given privatization inflows and assuming a stable political transition) and will also likely show an 
increasingly broadening base in terms of targeted sectors (thanks to the opening of previously restricted sectors).    
  
6. 
Credit to the private sector: Loans provided to the private sector passed Birr 320bn last year—a historic 
high in nominal terms and the highest share relative to GDP seen in five years.  The recent decision to end NBE Bills 
should boost credit supplies to the private sector even further. Credit to the private sector is not just growing in 
size, but also improving in the types and terms of loans becoming available. 
 
7. 
Multilateral and Bilateral Partners: Reflecting a range of internal reforms, Ethiopia’s engagement with a 
wide range of official multilateral and bilateral partners is currently at its closest level seen in many years. The 
enhanced support of official external partners will add up to around $4bn, or 4% of GDP, annually if including grants, 
low-interest loans, and debt rescheduling. Such official external support is supplemented by large private sector 
inflows including remittances from the diaspora (~$6bn annually) and foreign investment (~$3-$4bn).  Taken 
together, these external financing flows are making possible investment levels (~35% of GDP) that are well beyond 
available domestic savings (24% of GDP). 
 
8. 
Privatization: Though almost two years have passed since the announcement of the recent round of 
privatization, 2020 should be the first year that sales transactions take place and fx inflows of as much as $5bn-$7bn 
are possible over the course of three years, in our view. Fx inflows from privatization may not all be available for 
government use (as some portion may be used to repay external debt), but this will still improve the country’s net 
external position and enable the concerned enterprises to return to financial health. Beyond just the financial gains 
involved, privatization should—with the right safeguards—bring positive spillovers to the operating environment of  
technology dependent businesses and of a range of domestic services such as logistics and distribution. 
 
9. 
Exchange Rate and Fx Supplies:  The faster pace of exchange rate adjustment put in place since end-2019 
is a very positive step that signals a clear intention to address Ethiopia’s long-standing fx challenges. With this 
change, the gap between the official and parallel market rate has fallen, though it remains substantial (around 25 
percent). Somewhat unexpectedly, the IMF program has not been used as a framework to make a more immediate 
adjustment of the Birr towards its market rate, but it is still possible that meaningful exchange rate reform could be 
forthcoming in the near-term since a roadmap to review and revise fx policies is promised by April 2020. 
 
10. 
Financial Sector Reforms: Reforms enacted over the past year are beginning to address many of the past 
bottlenecks seen in the financial sector—including its small overall size relative to the economy (just ~33% GDP), its 
lopsided allocation of credit (two-thirds going to the public sector), and its limited menu of service offerings suited 
to the needs of local borrowers (in terms of cost, collateral, instruments, and maturity). While still in the early stages, 
reforms to date are helping boost private credit supply, reduce borrowing costs, and ease collateral requirements. 
Looking ahead, 2021 should mark the start of some limited private debt and equity markets as well as the emergence 
of new financial institutions (including non-banks) specialized in fin-tech offerings, Islamic banking, leasing, SME 
financing, mortgage loans, and agricultural credit—all of which should gradually broaden the volume, mix, 
instruments, pricing, and terms of funding available within Ethiopia’s fast-expanding financial sector.

1. A Major Threshold Crossed: Ethiopia’s per capita income passes $1,000 this year.  
Ethiopia’s per capita income has crossed $1,000 as of early 2020, based on this year’s expected US dollar 
GDP of $109.5bn (3,422bn in Birr terms) and a population count—per official statistics—of just above 100 
million (Table 1.1). Accounting for the lower average cost of goods in Ethiopia compared to other 
countries, incomes on a Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) basis are—by our estimates—$2,748 per capita 
this year (Table 1.2).  The doubling of per capita income to $1,000 has taken almost eight years, given that 
Ethiopia’s per capita income was $554 as recently as 2012-13. 
 
    
    
 
   
Focusing just on urban Ethiopia, median per capita incomes are roughly two-and-a-half times the nation-
wide average or near $2,500 per year by our estimate (Table 1.3).  In PPP terms, average urban incomes 
would be closer to $6,400 per year or $530 per month. This average urban per capita figure is more 
representative of the income of the roughly 20 percent of the population (around 20 million people), now 
living in urban areas per national statistics.

for 2020, based on official CSA projections under the Medium-Case Population Growth Scenario (See ICPS document on CSA website) 
Given USD GDP projected, the $1,000 per capita threshold is crossed even if Ethiopia's population is as high as 109.5mn in 2020.

Reflecting many consecutive years of rising nominal incomes, the aggregate value of private 
sector consumption in the economy passed Birr 1,848bn (S66bn) last year (Table 1.4).  
This figure reflects—and is derived from—total national 
disposable income reaching Birr 2,924 billion in 2018-19 
(GDP of Birr 2,696bn plus transfers from abroad of Birr 
240bn), of which Birr 949bn went into investment, Birr 
247bn represented government consumption, and the 
residual Birr 1,848bn (nearly 70 percent of GDP) was 
private sector consumption (Table 1.5). At roughly 
$66bn in dollar terms, the size of private sector 
consumption in Ethiopia ranks fourth place in sub-
Saharan African, behind only the levels seen in Nigeria, 
South Africa, and Kenya (Table 1.6).  This figure 
effectively represents the aggregate purchasing power 
of private households on an annual basis, and is a close 
proxy of total consumer spending in the economy.

With respect to just the urban component of 
private  sector consumption, we estimate that 
the aggregate spending of urban consumers is 
now close to Birr 450bn ($16bn) per year. This 
estimate reflects an average of two approaches, 
namely: (1) taking a 23 percent of total nation-
wide private consumption (slightly above the 
urban population share), and (2) multiplying 
average estimated urban per capita incomes with 
the urban population figure. The average of the 
two approaches yields a figure of around Birr 
450bn ($16bn). In terms of the breakdown of this 
figure 
for 
urban 
purchasing 
power, 
the 
composition of the consumer price index (meant 
to represent the consumption patterns of the 
average urban citizen) offers reasonably good 
guidance as to the broad categories of private 
expenditure—indicating, for example, that the 
typical urban Ethiopian spends 41 percent of 
his/her income on food, 23 percent for home 
rent/expenses, 6 percent for transport, 6 percent 
for 
clothing/footwear, 
5 
percent 
for 
communications, and around 2 percent each for 
categories such as education, medical care, and 
beverages. On this basis, we can estimate that, of 
the Birr 450bn in urban purchasing power, 
roughly Birr 186bn ($6.6bn) was spent on food 
items, Birr 105bn ($3.7bn) on home rent and 
furnishings, Birr 26bn ($1bn) on transport 
services, Birr 26bn ($0.9bn) on clothing and 
footwear amounts of near Birr 9bn ($0.3bn) each 
on education and medical care education. A 
tabulation of these estimated urban consumption 
aggregates—and implied market size—for the 
over two dozen main goods and services that 
make up the CPI index is provided below (Table 
1.7).

Crossing $1,000 in per capita income: what do other country experiences tell us? 
 
Ethiopia’s timing—how far behind? Looking at 
the timing of when some comparator countries 
crossed $1,000 in per capita income, one finds 
that this occurred in 1977 for a country such as 
South Korea that showed one of the fastest 
and sustained growth records in recent history. 
However, for many other countries (including 
potential economic ‘models’ for Ethiopia), the 
$1,000 threshold was crossed not that long 
ago: it occurred in 2001 in China, in 2007 in 
Vietnam and India, in 2011 in Kenya, and in 
2013 in Bangladesh. Indeed, based only on this 
(simplistic) metric, Ethiopia is just 19 years 
behind China, 13 years behind both Vietnam 
and India, 9 years behind Kenya, and 7 years 
behind Bangladesh (Table 1.8).
 
 
 
Cross-country comparisons—macro conditions after crossing $1,000: Comparing key macro conditions 
of comparator countries in the five years before and after crossing $1,000, we note that growth rates often 
remained roughly unchanged (growth was 6.4/6.0 percent in the five years before/after for the 
comparator countries), investment rates tend to rise relative to GDP (by about 4 percentage points of 
GDP), inflation rates drop somewhat (towards 7 percent—though they were already low to begin with in 
other countries), export levels jump by a few percentage points of GDP (to 32 percent of GDP) and the 
structure of the economy moves markedly away from agriculture and towards services (Table 1.9). Though 
these need not be seen as deterministic outcomes, if Ethiopia were to follow these patterns, we can 
anticipate continued strong growth supported by high investment, lower inflation, a rising export-to-GDP 
share, and a structural shift in the sectoral make-up the economy.

Cross-country comparisons—how fast to even 
higher incomes? Looking at the income record 
of comparator countries once they crossed 
$1,000 in per capita income reveals that they 
doubled average incomes—to $2,000—in an 
average of 10 years (Table 1.10). Were this to 
serve as a benchmark, we should expect 
Ethiopia to see a doubling of per capita income 
to $2,000 in ten years, or by 2029-30. However, 
as Ethiopia is currently growing roughly one-
and-a-half times the average growth of the 
comparable countries when they reached 
$1,000 in per capita income (9 percent vs 6 
percent), Ethiopia could reach $2,000 at an 
even faster pace. Indeed, under a  set of some 
plausible macro assumptions—growth of 7.5 
percent, inflation near 8 percent, annual Birr 
depreciation of 5 percent, and population 
growth of around 2 percent each year—
Ethiopia will reach a $2,000 per capita income 
as soon as 2027.

2. Development Policy: Not all State and not all Market… as it should be. 
Development policy: The overall direction of Ethiopia’s recent economic policies are being viewed, on 
the one hand, as a major shift towards neoliberal, free-market policies and, on the other hand, as a 
continuation of long-standing state-led and state-dominated policies. Neither view fully captures the 
reality, in our judgement, and policies are instead actually moving towards a mixed and pragmatic 
approach that seeks to put in place both a strong state and a strong private sector—each with its 
particular division of labour  and spheres of greater dominance. Our tabulation of reforms undertaken 
over the past two years reinforces this view and points to the fact that development policy is—precisely 
as it should be—neither ‘all state’ nor ‘all market’(Table 2.1). 
 
In terms of the move towards more liberal economic policies, there is certainly no shortage of recent 
reforms to show that Ethiopia is moving towards more market-based systems with greater private 
sector participation. The clearest manifestation of this can be seen in the large privatization program 
targeting the country’s largest state enterprises; the launch of Public-Private Partnerships to help fund 
many public sector projects; the substantial reform of Investment laws to allow deeper private and 
foreign investment; and the wide range of initiatives to improve the ease of doing business. We are also 
likely to see even further efforts to engage private investors in major sector-specific projects across the 
agricultural, manufacturing, and mining segments of the economy.

At the same time, it is erroneous to think that the role of government (or the ‘developmental state’ 
depending on one’s terminology) is withering away; to the contrary, there are equally significant 
initiatives being put in place to build-up and strengthen the state (Table 2.2).  For perspective, it is 
worth remembering that the state remains the nominal owner of all land in the country (the largest 
source of wealth by any measure); is the single largest investor in the economy (with a yearly capital 
expenditure budget of Birr 174bn or $5bn per year); is the largest wage employer in the economy; is 
the main provider of social services to the bulk of the population (education, health, and safety nets); 
and is also the largest financier in the economy (thanks to a state bank whose deposits—near Birr 560bn 
at end-2019—are roughly twice the amount of taxes collected last year). Even with privatization, the 
state will continue to maintain majority equity stakes and oversight roles in the country’s largest airline, 
power supplier, shipping/logistics operator, and telecom provider. Looking ahead, the state will have 
command of an even greater pool of resources as it boosts revenue (from Birr 311bn to Birr 972bn—or 
11.5 to 14.7 percent of GDP—over the coming five years) and as the main state bank expands its nation-
wide reach (especially to the un-banked). And finally, even within what are clearly private sector spaces, 
the regulatory role of the state will remain substantial as it sets the ‘rules-of-the-game’ in areas such as 
business operating requirements, competition policies, taxation, banking, and much more.  
  
 
Table 2.2: Policies and Reforms indicative of a Strong and Activist State
Strengthening the State: Examples from Recent Reforms and Policies 
1 Land ownership remains in state hands, but offered with user rights (in agriculture) and long-term leases (in urban areas)
2 Large land allocations at state discretion (e.g. for industrial parks, urban expansion, commercial farms) 
3 State dominant in public infrastructure goods provision, most notably roads, railways, power, water, sanitation
4 State remains largest single employer (1.6mn civil servants, public school teachers, health/agriculture extension workers)
5 State is largest educator (public schools and 50-plus universities) and largest health-care provider (public clinics/hospitals)
6 State to remain in position of influence/ownership even with part privatized SOEs 
7 State retains nearly 20 other large SOEs other than the big four enterprises (telecom, airlines, logistics, energy)
8 State is (de facto) largest housing developer, with plans to spend Birr 56bn for 500,000 new units in coming years
1 Large boost planned to state tax collections from 12 to 15 percent of GDP in five years (from Birr 311bn to Birr 972bn)
2 New revenue boosting measures will bring changes to current VAT, excise, and income tax regimes, and will potentially 
also include a new property tax, inheritance tax, 'chat excise tax', and motor vehicle circulation tax
3 Corresponding growth in expenditure envisaged from 15 to 17 percent of GDP in four years 
4 Public investment to continue at near 10 percent of GDP for the coming years
1 State bank still dominates financial sector with two-thirds of financial system assets
2 Financial sector remains heavily regulated, e.g., for foreign exchange and foreign borrowing, 
3 Financial sector remains (mostly) closed to foreign ownership and participation
1 Job Creation : Government is taking a pro-active, coordinating role to increase private sector job creation via a Job Creation 
Commission focused on: adopting 'job-rich' economic policies, addressing labor market gaps, and supporting sectors with 
high job-creation potential
2 Agriculture : Government is the primary actor and implementer for many past and recent initiatives in this area, including 
for example, efforts to improve seed varieties, increase fertilizer usage, expand irrigation, broaden commercialization, 
encourage clustering, and put in place irrigation-based low-land commercial farms
3 Industry: Government remains a major coordinator of industrial policies and acts as the administrator of Ethiopia's 
industrial parks--setting leasing rates, operating terms and conditions. Taxation, regulation, and competition policy also 
heavily set by state.
3 Services : Though most services activities are in private hands (retail, trading, hotels, restaurants, transport), the 
Government plays a lead role in setting the 'rules of the game' via sector-specific regulatory and competition policies.
5 Social Safety Nets and Social Protection : Government is still taking an active role to ensure social safety nets, including 
through cash transfers under the Productive Safety Net Program (considered 'the largest social protection system in Sub-
Saharan Africa'), via a new Urban Safety Net Program, and through a public expenditure policies that still allocate a 
sizeable share of the budget to 'poverty-reducing expenditures'. Funding under the PSNP to be indexed to food inflation to 
protect its real value for the coming years.

The combination of efforts to build a strong private sector alongside a strong state is not—as some 
might see it—a sign of muddled or incoherent policy or somehow a risk to future growth.  Indeed, the 
parallel strengthening of key state capacities/institutions alongside efforts to significantly expand the 
private sector are—as policy makers see it—positive and mutually reinforcing initiatives. Given this 
policy direction, the outlook for state-market (government-private sector) relations over the coming 
years points to the likely co-existence of: (1) an increasingly strengthening government and state 
enterprise sector still dominating public goods provision (though supplemented, on the margins, by 
private entrants in areas such as power generation, health, and education); (2) the state bank still 
delivering the majority of credit and fx provision (but increasingly serving private sector clients and 
doing so alongside a growing pool of private banks); (3) the domestic private business sector—including 
both SMEs and corporates—still remaining dominant players in agriculture, trading, services, and 
construction; and finally, (4) the foreign private sector increasingly dominating more specialized sub-
sets of the modern economy such as large-scale manufacturing, industrial/mining exports, and 
knowledge-intensive agricultural and agro-processing ventures (Table 2.3). This policy mix certainly 
need not be seen as an impediment to growth and can indeed yield positive growth and developmental 
outcomes for many years if, for example, the East Asian development records—and most notably the 
Chinese and Vietnamese cases—are any guide.

3. Macroeconomic Policy: Now more disciplined, more coherent, and more transparent.  
With a well-articulated Homegrown Economic Reform Plan (HGER) in place as well as the support of 
an IMF financing arrangement, macroeconomic policies in 2020 are set to be the most disciplined, 
coherent, and transparent seen in years. The HGER Program provides a roadmap of the Government’s 
intentions across a range of macroeconomic, structural, and sector-specific policies. The HGER does not 
provide a quantitative set of targets or goalposts, but it does lay out the broad framework on what 
policy initiatives should be expected for the coming years. More precisely, it proposes: (1) macro policy 
reforms (strengthening public finances, correcting fx imbalances, controlling inflation, safeguarding 
financial stability, and developing capital/financial markets to foster financial inclusion); (2) structural 
policy reforms (streamlining business regulations, improving governance at public institutions, power 
sector reforms, telecom reforms, export market access, improving logistics, and improving 
competitiveness in domestic goods/services markets); and (3) sector-specific policy reforms 
(agriculture, manufacturing, mining, tourism, and ICT).(Table 3.1) 
 
 
 
Following on the HGER, the Government has set out a more quantified and specific set of policy 
commitments under the framework of an IMF supported macroeconomic program. These 
macroeconomic reform plans are disclosed in detailed policy statements by the Finance Minister and 
Central Bank Governor in a “Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies”, or MEFP (see IMF Staff 
report, pages 53-72).  Most notably, to address current macro challenges, money supply growth will be 
limited to tackle inflation, borrowing limits will apply to the government’s use of commercial bank or 
central bank funds, and state enterprises will face tighter budget caps—all while ensuring still-high 
social sector spending for which minimum levels are targeted. The specific quantitative targets set out 
in the MEFP cover ten areas of macroeconomic policy, as tabulated below (Table 3.2):

of Ethiopia’s accession talks with the WTO started at end-January 2020 (after an eight-year pause) and, 
based on the Government’s announced intentions, the aim is to “bring Ethiopia into the WTO within 
the shortest possible period, ideally not later than the end of 2021.” WTO entry will modernize and 
institutionalize Ethiopia’s practices, laws, regulations on a range of trade and investment related 
matters—addressing issues such as export and import rules, market access, and competition policies. 
We note that Ethiopia’s entry is in many ways long overdue (it is one of only 23 countries still outside 
the WTO, given the body’s 164 current members) and that its entry into the WTO would be coming 
soon after crossing a $1,000 per capita income threshold. This, incidentally, is a path followed by many 
other countries who leveraged WTO entry to boost FDI, export, and growth trends: WTO entry took 
place in the year 2000 for China, 2007 for Vietnam, 1995 for Indonesia, and 1995 for Egypt—all around 
the same year of crossing the $1,000 per capita income threshold. 
 
External investor reaction to the government’s recent macroeconomic policy program has so far 
been quite positive and should continue to be so with strong execution of on-going reforms. 
Multilateral and bilateral support will, no doubt, be strengthened as macroeconomic policies are now 
better anchored and give greater assurances that a sustainable set of policies has been laid for 
Ethiopia’s long-term growth. Indeed, as part of the IMF program, an early and upfront vote of 
confidence was already provided by bilateral partners, who offered a debt re-profiling to cover 
upcoming debt service dues of around $600mn per year that would have otherwise been payable in 
each of the coming three years. With respect to private investors, yields on Ethiopia’s sole Eurobond 
issue have fallen since the announcement of the IMF program (though broader emerging market 
factors were also at play), with effective interest rate now below 4.8 percent as of January 2020 and 
the lowest ever seen since the bond’s issuance in 2014 (Table 3.4). Commentary from the few emerging 
market investment firms that cover Ethiopia has been clearly positive, with Renaissance Capital for 
example remarking in a research note that: “With a new focus on cheap external financing, plus more 
equity and foreign investment, and a track record of policy delivery, we think [Ethiopia] is setting itself 
up to be one of Africa’s most successful economies in the first half of the 21st century.”

4. Government and State Enterprise Finances: Putting a proper price on borrowed money. 
For the first time in decades, the Government is moving 
away from cheap and ‘captive’ financing sources and 
beginning to borrow at rates that better reflect the true 
cost of credit. The Government’s domestic debt—which 
reached Birr 362bn (13 percent of GDP) as of June 
2019—has been covered in recent years by borrowing at 
very low interest rates from the NBE, from commercial 
banks, and from the public pension funds. Interest rates 
on such borrowing ranged from zero to five percent—
with an effective average interest rate of just 2 percent 
on all Government domestic debt (Table 4.1). With 
inflation rates averaging above 10 percent during this 
period, real borrowing rates were clearly negative—
benefitting government for its wide range of activities, 
but in the process of hurting savers, the central bank, and 
the long-term asset value of public pension funds.  
 
In similar fashion, state enterprises have benefited 
from unusually large credits offered at unusually low 
rates, mainly from the CBE. The domestic debt stock of 
state enterprises currently stands at around Birr 411 bn 
(15 percent of GDP), mostly reflecting bonds issued to 
the state bank.  The borrowing was at slightly higher 
rates than those of Government, with MOFEC debt data 
showing that state enterprises enjoyed an average 
effective interest rate of 5.2 percent on all domestic 
debt (Table 4.2). Per the disclosures in CBE’s publicly 
released 2016-17 annual report, interest rates for 
Ethiopian Electric Power, Ethiopian Electric Utility, and 
Ethiopian Railway Corporation were generally set at the 
savings rate plus 1 percent, which translated into 
effective rates (given deposit rates at the time) of 
around 6 percent.  
 
These past policies have helped finance major national projects but at the same time resulted in 
several adverse impacts and distortions. As highlighted in the HERP, negative real interest rates and 
overvalued exchange rates both provided easy access to financial resources for the public sector, but 
at the cost of limiting returns to savers, shrinking funds available for the private sector, and contributing 
to external imbalances through high levels of public sector imports.  Moreover, as noted in a recent 
paper on Ethiopia’s experience with such policies of ‘financial repression’, other additional distortions

that built up included, for example, significant maturity mismatches for the state bank (as it relied on 
private sector deposits but gave out long-term loans and bonds), and perverse incentives for state 
enterprises (who were not encouraged to improve performance or repay loans given accommodative 
policies of  capitalizing interest on past due debt).1 
 
Recognizing these past distortions, the need to move at least partly towards market-based 
borrowing arrangements has been prioritized by policy makers, and the very first steps in that 
direction were taken with the launch of Market-Based Treasury Bill auctions at end-2019. 
Commercial banks have been the sole participants at the auctions so far and have begun to make their 
own interest rate bids/offers for the issued debt. With six treasury bill auctions having taken place as 
of mid-February, the interest rates have risen from 2 percent to as high as 8 percent—thus beginning 
to reflect market rates even if they remain negative in real terms (due to temporarily high inflation at 
present) (Table 4.3). Bid-cover ratios have been at least 100 percent for all auctions (meaning that all 
supply was taken up by participants), despite the fact that banks have temporarily been short of 
liquidity in the last few months. (Table 4.4).

The move away from cheap credit is still in its early stages, but is significant nonetheless given the 
government’s willingness to: (1) put in place a (self-imposed) hard budget constraint and (2) begin 
to set the foundations for other debt markets.  A higher cost of government borrowing is to be 
expected for future years and there will thus be a greater burden on the budget to cover debt service 
dues; this is, however, moving towards the norm seen in most other countries (Table 4.5) and has its 
own positive features as it forces the government to recognize the opportunity cost of its borrowing.  
Moreover, as parallel measures are being taken to boost government resources via revenue 
mobilization and additional external financing, the need for increased borrowing (and thus higher 
borrowing costs) should itself be more limited than before. For state enterprises, the harder budget 
constraint implied from recent policy commitments implies a need to improve their own internally 
generated financial resources (by charging more realistic  prices, expanding their services, reducing 
losses, or streamlining costs)

5. Investment in the economy: Some sub-components are stalling but still high levels overall. 
Despite a slowdown in some sub-components, investment remains at a high 35 percent of GDP per 
official FY 2018-19 data. The overall investment rate remains one of the highest rates in Africa (actually 
the highest if excluding mining economies) and also one of the highest on a global basis (Table 5.1). 
Relative to the investment rates seen in recent years, there is a modest slowdown (investment rates 
averaged 37 percent of GDP between 2014-15 to 2018-19) (Table 5.1B), but this primarily reflects a 
fall in public sector investment while private sector investment held up relatively well.  Still-high overall 
investment levels provide strong assurances that Ethiopia’s growth momentum can be sustained.

Seen from a five-year perspective, two notable trends with respect to investment are the rising share 
of private investment and an increasing reliance on domestic savings.  For 2018-19, public sector 
investment is 11 percent of GDP, per IMF data on the public vs private sub-components, while private 
sector investment is more than double that amount at 24.2 percent of GDP (Table 5.2). Private 
investment has risen from 8.5 to 24.2 percent of GDP over the past ten years. Of the 24 percent of GDP 
in private investment in 2018-19, most of it (Birr 565bn, or around 60 percent of total investment) 
reflected investment by domestic businesses while around Birr 87bn (~$3bn or 10 percent of total 
investment) constituted foreign direct investment.  
 
The current slowdown in FDI—per balance of 
payments data—has not brought down overall 
investment levels given the still limited share of FDI in 
total investment. For last year, for example, even as FDI 
inflows fell somewhat from the previous year (from 
$3.7bn to $3.1bn, or 4.4 to 3.1 percent of GDP), this was 
offset by domestic private investment given that total 
private investment rose from 22 to 24 percent of GDP 
between 2017-18 and 2018-19.  The recent rise of the 
private investment to GDP ratio means Ethiopia has 
among the highest such ratios across the ten largest 
Sub-Saharan African countries (Table 5.3)  
 
Regarding investment flows by economic sector, we estimate that investment continues to be 
dominated by construction activity, roadbuilding, and manufacturing investments in new 
industries. Within the public sector, the bulk of government capital investment is flowing into 
road-building (Birr 47bn), irrigation (Birr 14bn), agriculture (Birr 12bn), and construction works for 
government buildings such as ministry/region/woreda offices, universities, schools, and health 
facilities. Within domestic private sector investment, most investment is likely to be flowing into 
construction related businesses including commercial real estate, residences, and to a lesser 
extent in capital goods imports for basic manufacturing facilities. For FDI, most of the investment 
is the counterpart of new capital equipment imports brought in by foreign companies well as 
construction activities they undertake either as greenfields or for expanding existing facilities.  
 
Looking ahead, prospective FDI is likely to flow into a wider base of sectors as previously 
restricted areas open up with changes in investment regulations. The state enterprises being 
privatized are clearly one area that will see significant FDI inflows—thus implying large flows to 
telecoms, sugar industries, industrial parks, and power plants (as IPPs or PPPs). Logistics is already 
attracting FDI inflows and should continue to do so. Other areas being given high government 
support and likely to figure prominently in upcoming FDI inflows (besides manufacturing) include: 
mining developments; real estate; and commercial farm/irrigation ventures. Within services, the 
recent relaxation of investment regulations opens the way for enhanced inflows into areas such as 
domestic air and public transport, professional service firms, advertising, and media services.

6. Credit to the Private Sector: At record levels—and the types and terms are improving. 
Loans to the private sector passed Birr 320bn last year—a historic high in nominal terms and the 
highest share (relative to GDP) in five years (Table 6.1 and 6.2). Growth in lending by private banks is 
up around 44 percent as of end-2019, and is one of the highest growth rates seen in many years. While 
the recent progress is of course very positive, it remains the case that credit to the private sector is still 
only about one-third of overall credit, and is a much smaller share of the economy (12 percent of GDP) 
than that seen in many peer countries.  
 
     
   
 
 
 
 
Looking ahead, the decision to end NBE Bills represents a major policy change that promises to boost 
credit to the private sector. NBE Bills reached close to Birr 95bn (nearly a quarter of private bank 
deposits) as of end-2019, and this stock of funds will thus soon make its way back to the private sector.  
Considering the maturity profile of the NBE Bills (their five-year duration means roughly one-fifth of 
the total will return to the banks each year) and given the amounts that private banks would have had 
to buy had the NBE Bills policy stayed in place, the total extra resources becoming available to the 
private sector is on the order of Birr 25-30 billion per year. This represents about a quarter of last year’s 
incremental lending increase (which rose from Birr 179 to 250bn) and is thus a material addition to the 
supply of private sector credit for the banking system as a whole.

Credit to the private sector is not just growing in 
size, but also improving in the types and terms of 
loans becoming available. The market is beginning 
to provide a greater range of credit facilities better 
suited to borrowers’ needs—including SME loans, 
consumer loans, loans with looser collateral 
requirements (including moveable property or on 
a non-secured basis), and longer-maturity loans. 
One small but notable example is the sharp rise in 
offerings of personal and consumer loans this past 
year to meet the demands ofa growing base of 
salaried and middle-income clients (Table 6.3). But 
other features of private sector credit are 
beginning to change as well, as summarized in 
Table 6.4, thanks to growing competition among 
banks, new strategy plans being deployed at most 
banks with the help of global consulting forms, and 
the need to address changing market conditions 
and dynamics.  
 
  
 
 
 
Table 6.4: Credit to the Private Sector-- Emerging Trends and Directions
Banks are lowering interest rates follwing NBE bills removal
●  Awash Bank has reduced rates by up to 4.5 percent depending on the sector 
●  United Bank has lowered rates by up to 4.5 percent depending on the sector
●  Bank of Abyssinia has reduced rates by  up to 6 percent in certain cases
●  Most other private banks are likely to follow suit in reducing lending rates, given the direction taken      
by the Top 3 market leaders and the attendant competitive pressures               
Dedicated focus on SMEs, consumer/personal loans, and specialized loan types:
●  CBE has opened a dedicated unit to serve and lend to SMEs
●  Many private banks are separating units that serve large/corporate clients vs those serving SMEs, 
Medium-Sized firms, and Consumer/Household borrowers
●  Some private banks have already set aside dedicated pool of funds specifically for small or medium-
sized borrowers, and this trend is ikely to broaden within the banking industry.
●  Virtually all banks have started consumer loans offering home, auto, personal loans targeted at 
varied clients such as salaried workers, diaspora, NGO/International Organization employees, etc
●  Close to a dozen banks are under formation, with the aim of providing specialized lending services, 
such as Islamic Banking, residential and commercial mortgages, consumer banking, and agriculture.

7. Multilateral and Bilateral Partners: Ethiopia is now on top of most priority lists.  
Following Ethiopia’s extensive internal reforms over the past two years, its engagement with a wide 
range of international partners is currently at its closest level seen in many years. The closer 
cooperation and engagement is becoming evident across: (1) multilateral and bilateral institutions; (2) 
donors, lenders, and investors; and (3) debt as well as equity providers.  
 
The current year’s budget is one indication of an already closer re-engagement with many donors 
and lenders. Total external support includes 33 donors anticipated to provide $1.2bn in budgetary 
grants and 13 lenders expected to provide $1.4bn in low-interest budgetary loans (Table 7.1).  
 
 
Looking ahead, the commitment of most multilateral institutions towards Ethiopia is likely to be the 
strongest it has been in decades. The World Bank, the United Nations, the IFC, the IMF, the African 
Development Bank, the European Investment Bank, the Trade and Development Bank, the

International Fund for Agricultural Development, have for example already boosted their support or 
indicated their intention to substantially raise their financial support in the coming years. Such support 
will take place through varied instruments that will include grants (IDA, UN agencies), low-cost, long-
term loans (IDA, AfDB, IFAD), foreign exchange and macro policy support (IMF), and direct equity, 
lending, or trade finance support to the private sector (IFC, AfDB, TDB, and others) (Table 7.2).   
 
At the same time, many national governments and their development agencies are also continuing 
or deepening their engagements—and in many cases working with both the public and private 
sectors. Three large donors to Ethiopia—DFID, USAID, and the European Union—are long-standing 
partners who have provided humanitarian, social sector, and private sector support and continue to 
have active programs in Ethiopia that will likely be sustained or increased in the coming years. Private 
sector focused bilateral agencies are also expected to show a deeper engagement, including: the CDC 
of the UK; the Millennium Challenge Corporation and Development Finance Corporation (formerly 
OPIC) of the US; Proparco of France; and Scandinavian groups such as Norway’s Norfund, Sweden’s 
Swedfund, and Finland’s Finnfund. The Governments of rest of the G7—Germany, Italy, Canada and 
Japan—have in recent bilateral forums also indicated a strong readiness and willingness to provide 
both public sector and private sector support, as have governments or affiliates in China, Saudi Arabia 
and UAE. Additional or on-going support is also expected from private groups and foundations, such as 
the Gates Foundation, the Soros Foundation, the Mastercard Foundation, and others with initiatives 
focused on public health, education, financial inclusion, entrepreneurship, SMEs, and job creation.

The enhanced support of external partners is significant as external savings will remain critical for 
Ethiopia to maintain still high investment rates in the economy. Moreover, beyond just focusing the 
public sector, funding is now also flowing directly to the private sector in the forms of both debt and 
equity.  With domestic savings rates at around 24 percent of GDP, the needed pool of external 
resources (savings) to meet the 35 percent investment to GDP ratio is on the order of 10 percent of 
GDP each year. The enhanced support of official external partners—adding up to as much as $4bn, or 
4% of GDP, annually if including grants, low-interest loans, and debt rescheduling (Table 7.3)—is thus 
significant in that respect. Such official external support is supplemented by large private sector inflows 
including remittances from the diaspora (~$6bn annually) and foreign investment (~$3-$4bn). Taken 
together, these external financing flows are making possible investment levels that are well beyond 
available domestic savings and thus contributing to faster growth and developmental outcomes than 
would have otherwise been the case.

8. Privatization: Inflows will start in 2020, and should exceed $5 billion within three years. 
Though almost two years have passed since the announcement of the recent round of privatization, 
2020 should be the first year that sales transactions take place. Per the Government’s Memorandum 
of Financial and Economic Policies, privatization initiatives are currently most heavily focused on six 
main sectors: (1) telecommunications, (2) logistics; (3) railways; (4) industrial parks; (5) sugar; and (6) 
energy. Sectoral studies for all of these sectors (except industrial parks) are reported to be completed, 
with these assessments laying out the plans for the privatization strategy in each of the six sectors. For 
context, a listing of the 23 largest state enterprises, as well as their available financial indicators, are 
summarized below (Table 8.1 and 8.2).  
 
    
  
 
 
Based on plans announced so far, our rough estimates suggest that privatization related fx inflows 
could reach $5-$7bn over the coming three years (Table 8.3). These estimates are based on four main 
privatization prospects, namely: a part privatization of Ethio telecom and Ethiopian Shipping and 
Logistics Service Enterprise, the issuance of two new telecom licenses, and the sale of at least half of 
the remaining state enterprise stock (including sugar companies, industrial parks and other assets). 
Notably excluded is the part privatization of Ethiopian Airlines (which does not appear to be a near-
term prospect) and the privatization of the electric power company (whose large debt liabilities and 
financial challenges are likely to first require an extensive period of rehabilitation under state hands).  
These estimates are based on valuations seen in a sample of comparable emerging and frontier

markets—which show a Price-to-Earnings ratio of around 11x on average for telecom companies and 
around 9x for other companies (Table 8.4). On these valuation multiples (and an admittedly simplified 
estimation), total privatization receipts could fall within a range of $5.2 to $10.5bn, taking the 25th and 
75th percentiles as the applicable range, for a median value of $7.8bn.2

Fx inflows from privatization may not all be available for government use (as some portion may be 
used to repay debt or recapitalize capital), but this will still improve the country’s net external 
position. Any gross privatization receipts could, in principle, be utilized to: (1) recapitalize the existing 
companies; (2) to settle the company’s outstanding foreign/domestic debt; (3) or be transferred to the 
central government to be used for fiscal resources. Depending on which of these options, or 
combination of options, is selected the net impact in terms of resources made available to the 
government is unclear. Under either of the scenarios, the overall economy will of course be a 
beneficiary of the gross inflow of funds, but the ultimate beneficiaries could be the state enterprises 
themselves (if used for recapitalization), past lenders (if used for debt repayment), or the general 
population (if directed towards higher budgetary spending). 
 
Beyond solely the financial gains involved, privatization should deliver positive spillovers to the 
wider economy. Given the firms targeted for privatization, it is reasonable to expect a major 
improvement in the operating environment of telcom-dependent businesses and manufacturers, 
exporters, importers and other users of logistics and distribution services. The impacts could also be 
particularly notable with respect to the growth of fin-tech services (regulations permitting) and other 
tech-based start-ups and ‘digital disruptors’ seeking to address market needs in transport, health, 
education, entertainment or other areas.

9. Exchange Rate and FX Supplies: A realistic rate for the Birr not yet in place, but is on the horizon. 
The faster rate of exchange rate adjustment put in place since end-2019 has been a very 
positive step and signals a move to address Ethiopia’s long-standing fx challenges. The 
accelerated pace of adjustment has been evident since November 2019, and the annual 
depreciation rate has been moved from around 6 percent in mid-2019, to a pace that is now 
closer to 15 percent on annual basis as of February 2020 (Table 9.1).   
 
 
 
Though the gap between the official and parallel market rate has fallen somewhat, it remains 
substantial. The gap between the two rates is down from a peak of 38 percent in mid 2019 to about 
25 percent as of early 2020 (Table 9.2). On a positive note, the parallel rate appears to have stabilized 
in the past few months. At the same time, that the gap is currently on the order of 20-25 percent 
reveals an official exchange rate that is not yet reflective of its proper market rate. The size of the gap 
is—incidentally—roughly in line with the IMF’s estimated over-valuation (23-25 percent per the IMF 
Staff Report, though these estimates are seen to have high degrees of uncertainty).

With respect to policy initiatives focused on addressing the Birr’s misalignment and improving fx 
conditions, several planned measures have been highlighted in the Homegrown Economic Reform 
Plan. These include: increased privatization and low-cost borrowing; an improved remittance strategy; 
stronger efforts to boost diaspora savings; promoting exports/tourism/FDI; easing controls on fx sales 
to private importers’; and improving “the management and functioning of the fx market based on 
further study.” 
 
More recently, as part of the Government’s IMF-supported macro program, there is a clear statement 
that moving towards a market-reflecting exchange rate is a policy priority; however, the timing of 
such a move is not immediate but rather seen as a medium-term objective. Based on the contents of 
the IMF program, the ‘transition to a market-clearing exchange rate’ is envisaged ‘by the end of the 
program’ which implies an approximate timing towards the end of 2023. A quicker correction of the 
Birr rate to its market determined rate (as done for T-Bill rates) might have been expected, but this has 
not been the approach adopted. Moreover, while the NBE bills removal ended private banks from 
allocating 27 percent of their funds to government bills, the 30 percent surrender requirement faced 
by private banks on the fx collected from their clients remains in place, reducing by that magnitude the 
volume of foreign exchange they can make available to the private sector.  
 
While changes to the fx regime have thus been limited so far, it is nonetheless still possible that 
meaningful exchange rate reform could be forthcoming in the near-term. Per the IMF program, the 
Government will soon be finalizing (by April 2020) “a roadmap to deepen the fx market and move 
towards a more flexible exchange rate by the end of the program.”  If substantive reform measures are 
put in place as part of that roadmap and review, a move towards a quicker rate adjustment might thus 
be forthcoming, which would help reduce and remove foreign exchange shortages at a much faster 
schedule than currently envisaged.

10. Financial Sector Reforms : A slow start so far, but prospects look good for 2020 and 2021. 
Reforms enacted over the past year are beginning to address many of the past problems seen in the 
financial sector—including its small overall size relative to the economy (just ~33% GDP), its lopsided 
distribution of credit (two-thirds to the public sector), and its limited set of offerings that tailored to 
the needs of local businesses, SMEs, and households (in terms of cost, instruments, maturity, and 
collateral requirements).  
 
Specific measures enacted over the past two years are helping to boost private credit supply, reduce 
borrowing costs, and loosen collateral and other regulatory requirements (Table 10.1). Among the 
most notable reforms: (1) market-based securities have been introduced; (2) NBE Bill purchase 
requirements imposed on private banks have been discontinued; (3) certain segments of the financial 
sector—such as leasing—have been opened to foreign investors; (4) collateral requirements have been 
eased (e.g., movable collateral registry); and (5) diaspora investment into banking shares has been 
allowed.  
 
 
 
 
Additional financial sector reforms have been promised publicly or are to be expected in the near 
term.  These cover areas such as: (1) debt and capital markets; (2) deposit insurance; (3) modernizing 
monetary policy tools; (4) improving the operations of state banks; (5) financial inclusion policies; and 
(6) digital banking initiatives (Table 10.2).

Looking ahead, we think that—after a period mostly preparatory work this year—2021 is likely to 
mark the period of active implementation of most financial sector reforms. The opening of the sector 
to foreign banks remains unlikely even in 2021, in our view. Instead, the second half of 2020 or 2021 
should see the start of some limited private debt and equity markets as well as the emergence of new 
financial institutions (including non-banks) specialized in fin-tech offerings, Islamic banking, leasing, 
SME financing, mortgage loans, and agricultural credit—all of which promises to gradually broaden the 
volume, mix, instruments, pricing, and terms of funding provided by Ethiopia’s fast-growing financial 
sector.

SUMMARY: Recent Developments and Year-Ahead Outlook 
 
§ 
Growth: Compared to last year’s 9 percent outturn, GDP growth 
should slow slightly this year due to some of the tightening measures 
being implemented to reduce credit growth to the government and 
state enterprises. However, as recent agriculture data show a solid 
harvest (up almost 5 percent) and various proxies for construction 
and service activity point to near double-digit expansion in these large 
sub-sectors, we don’t expect a major slowdown and see a decent 
chance that growth will reach 8 percent for the year. The IMF 
forecasts 6.2 percent growth this year, which exaggerates the scale of 
the expected slowdown, in our view.  
 
§ 
Inflation: Ethiopia’s inflation rate remains in the range of 18-19 
percent at the start of 2020 and this high rate has now spread to 
services such as housing and transport (whose inflation rate was—
until recently—only around 10 percent for an extended period). An 
inflation rate in the low- to mid-teens will likely persist for most of 
2020, though a reduction towards 10 percent should be possible—
given tight limits now placed on base money growth—towards the 
end of the year.  While central bank policies will work to reduce 
inflation, supply-side shocks (such as potential domestic disruptions 
linked to elections) could affect food prices and keep inflation high; 
this is not our baseline expectation but is a noteworthy risk. 
 
§ 
Investment: While some components of investment (e.g. FDI) are 
stalling, total investment should still remain at around 33-35 percent 
of GDP this fiscal year given high government capital spending and 
the substantial credit expansion taking place at private banks (with its 
associated private domestic investment). 
 
§ 
Fiscal: Even with a Birr 28bn Supplementary Budget being added this 
month, fiscal deficit outturns for the year should—due to extra 
available resources—come in close to the initial budgeted figures 
(below 3% of GDP), while the debt ratio will decline markedly to 52 
percent of GDP by June 2020. Judging by commitments in the macro

program, the fiscal year starting in July 2020 will show a 2.5% of GDP 
budget deficit, while debt ratios should remain broadly unchanged.  
 
§ 
Banking and credit: Credit conditions for private business improved 
last year and should continue to do so in 2020, as the end of NBE Bill 
purchase requirements allows private banks to boost lending to the 
private sector. Recent liquidity problems (due to weak asset-liability 
management by banks) should be short-lived and lending growth at 
private banks is on track to reach 40 percent for the fiscal year judging 
from end-December outturns; reflecting this, plus improved fx inflows 
at most banks, profits at private banks will pass Birr 14bn this year, by 
our estimates, vs Birr 11bn last year. 
 
§ 
Foreign exchange: Despite a somewhat faster pace of monthly 
exchange rate adjustment, fx conditions will remain challenging this 
year given the backlog of unmet fx demand and the gradual pace of 
some large expected fx inflows (i.e., privatization). The gap between 
the official and parallel market rates is now roughly 25 percent—
notably lower than last year’s gap of 37 percent but substantial 
nonetheless. The Government’s IMF-supported macro program takes 
a gradual approach to addressing Ethiopia’s exchange rate 
misalignment (though we would have expected—and liked to have 
seen—a quicker correction). Reflecting this state of affairs, businesses 
seeking foreign exchange will continue to face extended waiting times 
at banks till at least the end of 2020, though planned reforms to the 
fx market (including a promised review of policies in this area being 
prepared by April 2020) could—if substantive—help reduce and 
remove fx waiting times at banks next year.    
 
§ 
Risks: Given planned elections this year, public confidence and 
business sentiment may turn cautious or negative during the year 
(leading to cutbacks in investment and thus lower growth), but risks 
in this area are offset somewhat by on-going improvements in macro 
policies and by the continuation of structural reforms (privatization, 
PPPs, job creation initiatives, and ease of doing business reforms). A 
relatively stable socio-political environment for the remainder of the 
year will remain critical to avoid an interruption of Ethiopia’s recent 
investment and growth record—and indeed forms the basis for our 
baseline macro projections. 
 
A summary of our full set of macroeconomic projections for the new 
fiscal year—covering the real, banking, fiscal, and external sectors—is 
provided in the attached Annex (pages 49 and 50).

ECONOMIC ACTIVITY: Recent Developments and Outlook
§ 
Recently released agricultural data 
show this year’s crop harvest was 
32.9mn tons, up 4.3 percent, and in 
line with our forecasts last year. 
 
§ 
Total acreage cultivated during 
the crop season was 12.8 mn 
hectares (unchanged from a year-
ago) which gives an average 
yield—across all crops—of 2.58 
tons per hectare. Yields were up 
by 4 percent from year-ago, and 
so virtually all of the observed 
crop increase was driven by 
improved yields rather than 
increasing hectares farmed.  
 
§ 
The growth of 4.3 percent seen 
for crops is somewhat below the 
long-term average, given the 6.2 
percent average annual growth 
seen for Ethiopia’s crop sector 
over the past decade.  
 
§ 
Among cereals, growth was 
particularly strong for teff and 
maize (both up 7.5 percent) as 
well as wheat (up 4.1 percent); 
these three crops—together with 
sorghum and barley—make up 
Ethiopia’s top 5 cereal crops. 
 
§ 
Among pulses and oilseeds, the 
strongest growth was seen in 
soya beans, mung beans, and 
oilseeds—all of which grew 
strongly from depressed levels 
in the prior year.

Growth outlook:  
 
§ Though there have been 
concerns about agriculture 
growth being affected this year 
due to the locust infestation in 
many parts of East Africa, our 
assessment of FAO and the 
Ministry of Agriculture 
information releases suggests 
there will not be a material 
impact. 
 
§ FAO reviews as of February 
2020 show that most of the 
locust infestations occurred 
either in areas with limited 
crop production or well after 
Ethiopia’s harvest season. 
 
 
§ Moreover, estimates of 
locust-infested areas by the 
Ministry of Agriculture are 
that a total of 70,000 
hectares have been  affected 
across different parts of the 
country. 
 
§ This figure is only 0.55 
percent of Ethiopia’s total 
crop land (12.7 million 
hectares). Even if all the crops 
in those affected areas were 
assumed lost (an extreme 
case), the impact on the 
overall economy would be 
just 0.2 percent of GDP (as 
crop output is just 33 percent 
total GDP).

Growth outlook—continued: 
 
§ 
Beyond agriculture, activity 
indicators in the wider economy  
point to generally positive trends  
up to end-December (or end-
September depending on data 
availability), though there are 
notable weaknesses in some areas. 
 
 
§ 
The weak spots include a 
slowdown in FDI inflows (down 25 
percent for the first six months of 
the fiscal year), a slower rate of 
SOE bond borrowing (negative in 
real terms and suggesting lower 
investment), lower capital goods 
imports, and a moderation of 
deposit growth at banks. 
 
 
 
 
 
§ 
Areas suggesting still-positive and 
expanding economic activity 
include tax collections (up 29 
percent in nominal terms, or 13 
percent in real terms), lending 
growth (up 31 percent in nominal 
terms), industrial park exports, 
tourist  arrivals, and fuel 
consumption (in volume terms).

Growth outlook—continued: 
 
§ 
Taken all together, i.e., 
considering 4 percent crop growth 
as well as proxies for construction 
and services activity, we expect 
that overall GDP growth can reach 
8 percent for the fiscal year.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
§ 
Our growth projection is 
somewhat above the average 
growth forecasts of various 
institutions, per our compilation. 
 
 
§ 
Our slightly higher projection 
(versus the average of all others) 
likely reflects our incorporation of 
recent data on this year’s crop 
harvest and of end-December 
banking, tax, and services 
indicators.

PRICES AND INFLATION: Recent Developments and Outlook 
 
Inflation outturns:  
 
§ 
Year-on-year inflation was 
18.7 percent in January 2020, 
and has now shown double-
digit rates for over two years 
and remained above 15 
percent for 17 months. 
 
§ 
After an extended period 
of moderate inflation, 
services inflation is now 
nearing 20 percent, 
driven by items such as 
housing, electricity, and 
transport costs. 
 
§ 
We find the persistence of 
inflation inconsistent with 
some recent developments 
(i.e., positive food harvests, 
restored transport links, 
and moderating money 
supply growth), and its 
underlying sources may 
thus be better explained 
and driven by (self-fulfilling) 
public expectations. 
 
§ 
If expectations have 
become the dominant 
influence for inflation, only 
a convincing break from 
past policies and a 
disciplining macro 
framework can help alter 
expectations—in which case 
the recent Govt-IMF macro 
program may begin to make 
a difference.

Month on month inflation:  
 
§ 
One positive element 
within the most recent 
inflation data is that 
month-on-month 
inflation has been below 
its long-term norms the 
past two months, 
suggesting that it is 
mainly the accumulated 
price increases to date 
that are carrying over 
into high year-on-year 
inflation figures.  
 
 
 
 
Inflation projections:  
 
§ 
If the current pattern of 
month-on-month figures 
continues to mid-year, 
then inflation should 
begin to fall sharply by 
June 2020, as the index 
showed large jumps in 
mid-2019 and 
comparisons to mid-2020 
will show more moderate 
year-on-year price 
increases.  
 
§ 
Though inflation has 
become difficult to 
forecast, and could 
continue to show one or 
two months of upside 
surprises in the period 
ahead, we still see it 
falling to around 13 
percent by mid-June and 
to near 10 percent by 
December.

MONETARY POLICY: Recent developments and outlook 
 
Monetary growth: 
 
§ 
Broad money growth has 
remained within the 
narrow 20-25 percent 
annual increases seen 
over the past year.  
 
§ 
With nominal GDP growth 
expected to be above 26 
percent this year, the ratio 
of broad money to GDP 
will be falling this year 
(pointing to a decline in 
monetization, or the ratio 
of money-to-GDP, within 
the economy).  
 
§ 
Reserve money growth 
had fallen substantially 
at end-September but 
has now reverted back 
to growth of 15 percent.  
This is likely to moderate 
for the period ahead,  
given a 12.5 percent 
growth target set under 
the Government-IMF 
macro program.

Domestic financing: 
 
§ 
Total financing supplied 
within the economy grew to 
1.3 trillion as of end-
September 2019, up around 
26 percent from year-ago. 
 
§ 
The public sector’s use 
of total domestic 
financing is now 64 
percent, a slight decline 
from 68 percent at end-
2018.  
 
§ 
By instrument, the share 
of bond-financing has 
risen to 36 percent, 
reflecting large SOE 
borrowings via bond 
issues to the CBE. 
 
Bank loans by sectors:  
 
§ 
Based on Sept 2019 
data, the areas of fastest 
credit growth were 
housing and 
construction, domestic 
trade, exports and 
imports, and personal 
loans 
 
§ 
Industry remains the 
largest recipient of 
loans, largely reflecting 
SOE allocations at CBE 
 
Outstanding bond issuances: 
 
§ 
Growth in bond issuance 
is in line with the 15-20 
percent seen recently.  
 
§ 
As before, EEPCO remains 
the largest bond issuer

Public debt, in USD terms: 
 
§ 
Public debt is beginning 
to decline in levels and 
not just as a share of 
GDP; for end-Sept 2019, 
public debt was $53.6 
bn, or down from its 
peak of $53.7bn. 
 
§ 
Public debt is now almost 
exactly split evenly 
between domestic and 
external debt 
 
Public debt, relative to GDP: 
 
§ 
Relative to this year’s 
anticipated USD GDP, 
public debt as of Sept 
2019 fell to just 48.9% of 
GDP. As new loans are 
contracted up to June 
2020, this figure will rise 
modestly and should end 
the fiscal year in the low 
50s as a share of GDP. 
 
 
External debt stocks: 
 
§ 
Total external debt is 
now just below 25 
percent of USD GDP, one

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS (BOP): Recent developments  
 
Balance of payments: 
 
§ 
Full balance of payments 
data are only available to 
Sept 2019, though some 
components (exports, 
imports, FDI, reserves) 
are available and 
reported here for end-
December 2019.  
 
§ 
The outturns for the first 
quarter of the fiscal year 
point to a marked drop 
in reserves that quarter, 
reflecting a drop in 
several current account 
items (services exports, 
remittances and grants) 
as well as large public 
sector debt repayments.  
 
§ 
Some of these items 
appear to have reversed, 
however, as reserves 
rose in the second 
quarter of the fiscal year 
(see below). 
 
 
FX reserves: 
 
§ 
Fx reserves were around 
$3bn at end-December 2019, 
despite having dropped to as 
low as $2.6bn in Sept 2019. 
 
§ 
Official inflows, particularly 
funding received as part of 
the IMF program approved 
in Dec 2019, are likely to 
explain the year-end 
increase to near $3bn.

TRADE PERFORMANCE: Recent developments 
 
Export performance: 
 
§ 
Exports are performing 
moderately well, though 
the growth rate slowed 
from 15 percent at end-
September to 11 percent 
at end-December 2019. 
 
§ 
Given $1.3bn in six-month 
exports, the full year 
export figure is unlikely to 
exceed $3bn. We forecast 
8 percent growth in 
exports this year, for a full 
year figure of $2.9bn.  
 
 
 
§ 
Among large-value 
exports, the best 
performing exports this 
past quarter were 
flowers, fruits and 
vegetables, live animals, 
and textile products.  
 
§ 
Some export sub-
components are showing 
record high levels, 
including flowers and 
textile products. On 
current trends, flowers 
are likely to become 
Ethiopia’s second largest 
export after coffee, and 
textiles will not be that 
far behind (potentially 
fourth largest overall 
within the coming year).

Export performance--continued 
 
§ 
Industrial park exports stalled in 
the latest quarter (down 2 
percent between Sept and Dec), 
but are 28 percent above year-
ago levels and are likely to 
exceed $200mn in annual 
exports this fiscal year  
 
§ 
The top three Industrial Parks 
with the best export 
performance are Hawassa IP, 
Bole Lemi IP, and Eastern IP 
 
Import performance 
 
§ 
Overall imports are down 6 
percent in the first half of the 
fiscal year, which would 
normally suggest weak 
domestic economic activity. 
 
§ 
However, a closer look at the 
data shows that this partly 
reflects declines in one-off 
aircraft imports (-94%) and in  
reduced fuel imports due to 
lower global oil prices (-6%). 
Excluding these two items, 
non-fuel and non-aircraft 
imports grew by 5 percent.  
 
§ 
Consumer goods were down 6 
percent, likely reflecting the 
faster recent depreciation and 
an adjustment away from 
higher-cost consumer items. 
 
§ 
Capital goods imports were down 
overall—but mainly due to 
declines in aircraft imports. 
Capital goods related to 
agriculture were up 57% and 
those related to industry up 6%.

ETHIOPIA’S SOVEREIGN BOND: Recent developments and outlook 
 
Sovereign Bond Yields: 
 
§ 
Ethiopia’s sovereign bonds have 
fallen to their lowest yields since 
they were issued five years ago 
in December 2014. 
 
§ 
This mainly reflects global 
factors (EM yields have fallen 
across the board), but Ethiopia 
also saw a distinct decline in 
yields following the IMF program 
announcement in early Dec 2019 
 
Sovereign Bond Prices: 
 
§ 
Bond prices are at historic highs, 
and holders of Ethiopia’s 
Eurobonds have received a more 
than 15 percent total return in 
dollar terms for 2019 (given the 
6.625% coupon on the bond plus a 
near 8% price appreciation).  
 
 
 
 
 
Spread vs US Treasuries: 
 
§ 
The gap between US 10-
Year bonds and 
Ethiopia’s 10-Year bond 
is also now at one of its 
lowest ever levels of just 
3.43 percentage points.

EXCHANGE RATE: Recent developments and outlook 
 
Exchange rate trends: 
 
§ 
After two months of sharp 
depreciations in November and 
December (1.2 Birr per month), 
exchange rate adjustments have 
moderated more recently—as 
we expected—and are now 
averaging 22 cents per month. 
  
§ 
The exchange rate has now 
depreciated by 14 percent 
from year-ago levels (32.28 at 
end-February 2020 vs 28.34 
at end February 2019).  
 
§ 
Continuing the current pace of 
Birr depreciation, i.e. 22 cents 
per month, would move the 
exchange rate by 8 percent in a 
year’s time. We think the 
central bank would aim for a 
somewhat higher annual rate 
of depreciation, given inflation 
differentials between Ethiopia 
and its trading partners and the 
need to maintain external 
competitiveness.  
 
§ 
An annual depreciation of 
between 10-15 percent is 
thus more likely to be 
targeted, in our view, 
implying somewhat higher 
monthly depreciations in the 
latter half of 2020. On this 
basis, we see the rate 
reaching 33.16 Birr/USD by 
end-June and just under 36 
Birr/USD by end-December.
