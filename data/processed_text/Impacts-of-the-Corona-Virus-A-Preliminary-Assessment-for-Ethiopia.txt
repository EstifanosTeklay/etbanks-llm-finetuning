We make an effort to assess the likely impacts of the corona virus for Ethiopia’s 
economic sub-sectors and for the near-term macro outlook. We find that even 
under a ‘limited virus spread scenario’ (where the dominant agricultural and 
construction sectors remain largely unaffected), there will still be severe shocks 
faced by the hospitality industry, exporters, certain manufacturers, and banks. 
Policy interventions can minimize these impacts but will entail considerable fiscal 
and monetary resources.  
 
• Ethiopia’s exposure: Ethiopia’s exposure to the corona virus seems to be very 
limited—so far—based on officially reported statistics. Among the 14 
countries in the world with populations over 100mn, Ethiopia has the lowest 
reported virus incidence (26 cases at end-March) and is the only one with 
zero reported deaths.  
 
• Macro impacts: Given the relatively limited spread of the virus to date, the 
early economic impacts are concentrated in a few segments of the 
economy—namely the hospitality industry, exporters (flowers/textiles), 
certain manufacturers, and banks. The more dominant rural, agricultural, and 
construction sub-sectors of the economy are so far not much affected, which 
could continue to be the case if containment efforts are successful in 
maintaining a ‘limited virus spread scenario’. However, even with just the 
current sub-set of affected sectors, the economic impacts will be 
considerable: by our estimates, growth will be 2.5 percentage points lower 
next year (falling to 5 percent) and net balance payments impacts close to 
$1.5bn billion. If a wider and more adverse domestic virus spread scenario is 
assumed, and should the global recovery be prolonged, macro impacts would 
be several orders of magnitude larger than is presented here. 
 
• Policy responses: While the government has acted quite quickly and 
decisively with a range of public health measures, interventions on the 
economic policy front are still in their early stages—especially if seen against 
the aggressive actions being taken in other developed and developing 
countries. A range of fiscal, monetary, and sector-specific policies has been 
put into effect this past week, but an even broader and deeper set of 
interventions in these areas could potentially do more to reduce adverse 
impacts for businesses and employees. On the basis of ‘limited virus spread 
scenario,’ and if the stimulus measures seen in other countries were to serve 
as a guide, we estimate that fiscal resources needed for public relief packages 
could reach Birr 90bn (2.3% of GDP) and that central bank liquidity 
interventions of around Birr 47bn (1.2% of GDP) may be required.

Ethiopia’s exposure 
 
Ethiopia has been fortunate to have a comparatively small number of reported corona virus cases so far.  
As of end-March, the number of affected persons stood at just 26 persons, was almost exclusively in the 
capital city, and showed no obvious signs of shifting to an exponential growth trajectory (Table 1). Among 
the 14 countries in the world with populations of more than 100mn people, Ethiopia shows the lowest 
reported virus incidence and is the only one with zero reported deaths (Table 2). Even if there may be doubts 
on Ethiopia’s reported figures (given very limited testing), there is little to suggest that a large number of 
deaths are occurring or that mass numbers of corona-affected people are filling up hospitals/health centres; 
this implies that prevalence/sickness is so far generally low within the population

Looking ahead, a key question for any macroeconomic assessment is whether current containment policies 
can continue to maintain this ‘limited virus spread scenario’. If current containment policies are successful 
and the ‘limited virus spread scenario’ remains in place, then both the number of affected economic sub-
sectors and the geographic/nation-wide range of impacts will be relatively confined. On the contrary, 
however, it is possible that the number of infected persons rises exponentially in the coming weeks, reaches 
a critical number of say 1,000 or more cases, and then crosses a ‘tipping point’ where more drastic lockdown 
measures are imposed to limit overall economic and social activity. The human and social toll would be 
sharply different in such an adverse alternate scenario, as will be the attendant economic consequences.1 
 
For our analysis, given the scale and scope of the government’s public health measures as well as the early 
introduction of many preventive actions, we assume a ‘limited virus spread scenario’ where economic 
impacts are largely confined to four already affected sub-sectors. Moreover, we assume that the corona 
impacts will be most severe for the immediate quarter ahead (April-June 2020) while being followed by a 
slow but gradual recovery of affected economic activity—both in Ethiopia and globally—in the following six 
months (July-December 2020). Should this overarching assumption be incorrect, and if global ‘lockdown’ 
conditions turn out to be much longer and deeper than presumed, our assessment below would warrant a 
full reconsideration. 
  
Sector-specific impacts: 
 
Even under a ‘limited virus spread scenario’, at least four economic sub-sectors should clearly be expected 
to face severe and disruptive shocks: 
 
• Hospitality industry: This sector is facing an almost complete loss of customers, with lots of evidence 
throughout Addis Ababa of near-empty hotels, restaurants, bars, barbers/salons; of taxis barely finding 
riders; and of tourist sites experiencing major cancellations for the next 3-6 months. Occupancy rates 
are reportedly at just a few percent of capacity (consistent with Bole Airport entry figures of as low as 
50-100 per day). Many hotels have started giving workers mandatory leave (some paid, some unpaid) 
on the expectation that this will be temporary, but if conditions persist for many months a large share 
of those staff may be laid off (potentially affecting tens of thousands of workers).  
 
• Flower exporters are threatened by several quarters of near-zero revenue if conditions in Europe—the 
primary market—take a long time to recover. First half of year exports were $225mn and the fiscal year 
outlook was for around $450mn in exports (possibly second-largest after coffee); if the last four months 
of flower exports are near zero, then year total exports will be $150mn lower than expected (Table 3). 
The recent removal of the NBE minimum price set for flowers (USD 3.8 per kilogram) is not seen as that 
meaningful since the underlying problem is the collapse in European demand. Around 150,000 workers 
are reportedly employed in the sector, so numbers of newly unemployed in a few concentrated areas 
could potentially be quite significant.   
 
1 Though the evidence seems far from certain in this area, experts and commentators have noted that the corona virus shows 
comparatively lower spread in countries with larger youth populations and in warmer climates, both of which would (if valid) appear to 
be positive for Ethiopia. At the same time, other characteristics of countries with the socio-economic conditions of Ethiopia work in the 
opposite direction: high density living areas (at least in cities), congested public transport systems, limited clean water supplies, and weak 
public health systems. The net impact of these factors is of course highly uncertain.

• Textile exporters have faced a suspension of orders from big US, European, and Chinese companies and 
face considerable uncertainty on how long this will last; some have reportedly been told they will be 
informed within the next few months. Textile exports were $100mn in the first half of year and a 
prolonged suspension may thus cost up to $50mn in foregone exports per quarter (Table 4).  
 
 
 
• Manufacturers, especially those dependent on foreign inputs from China (which supplies 26% of 
Ethiopia’s total imports), are reporting delays in getting critical inputs, machinery, raw materials or 
accessories. Manufacturers are also having problems with travel interruptions affecting 
incoming/existing expatriate staff. Such supply chain interruptions are particularly severe for import-
dependent manufacturers (a significant share in Ethiopia), and this could reduce or completely stop their 
operations for several quarters if the Chinese recovery is slow to pick up.

• Banks: Already facing very tight liquidity conditions even before the corona crisis (most private banks 
have effective loan-to-deposit ratios near/above 100%), banks are now threatened by a potential jump 
in NPLs as businesses become unable to service loan repayments. While Birr 15bn of liquidity support 
has recently been announced for the sector, bankers have been underwhelmed by this offer and found 
it largely inadequate. As relayed by those in the sector, the Birr 15bn has been offered against the stock 
of NBE Bill repayments that Banks were to receive from NBE in the coming year up to June 2021; 
effectively, the NBE is buying back these Bills and providing banks upfront liquidity in exchange (similar 
to central bank bond-buying programs in countries with open market operations). However, we 
understand that deductions are applied to amounts the banks may have still owed to NBE when the 
policy was discontinued back in November 2019, and so the overall liquidity injection for banks is less 
than the headline figure may suggest. Moreover, as banks already had outstanding short-term loans due 
to NBE from recent borrowings (which added up to Birr 14.5bn from emergency loans given out in 
January and February 2020), most of the fresh funds made available as part of the corona response may 
effectively be absorbed by those repayments, leaving banks and hence their customers with much fewer 
net resources.  
 
Multi-sectoral impacts: number of firms and employees 
 
• Firms affected: Seen from the perspective of the numbers of businesses affected—across all sectors—a 
rough estimation suggests a figure on the order of 15,000 to 20,000. The number of hotels in Addis 
Ababa is estimated at 500-800 establishments (depending on definitions/coverage) and a similar count 
might be assumed for the rest of the country. Others in the hospitality and service industry (e.g., 
restaurants, bars) would number in the range of 6,000 to 8,000 firms in Addis Ababa alone, using 
historical data and applying recent economy-wide growth rates (Table 5). Broadening the net, the 
inclusion of other affected service providers such as personal care providers (barbers, salons, gyms), 
tour operators, taxi drivers, SMEs supplying foodstuffs and other inputs to hotels, could conceivably also 
an equal 6,000 to 8,000 firms.  Flower exports, per association data, are no more than 100 growers 
though the top 10 firms—most based in the Ziway area—actually account for the bulk of total sales and 
total employment. Horticulture exporters would be a broader group of perhaps several hundred 
growers. Textile companies number in the range of 300-400 firms per CSA statistics and recent Industrial 
Park figures, while other heavily affected manufacturers (facing supply chain disruptions linked to their 
imported inputs) may be in the range of 1,000 to 2,000 firms. All considered, a plausible estimate seems 
to be in the range of 15,000 to 20,000 businesses—mostly SMEs—in the hospitality, export, and 
manufacturing sectors that could face material declines in revenue over the coming year.

• Employment impacts: Focusing on the potential size of affected employees, the numbers involved could 
exceed one million based on some plausible assumptions. Starting from the largest employer groups, 
flower and horticulture farms are reported to employ 150,000 workers in several concentrated 
locations. The other significantly affected export group, namely textile exporters, employs in the range 
of 50,000 to 70,000 people. For established hotels, an assumed 1,200 establishments nation-wide and 
40 staff per median hotel would imply around 50,000 staff. Given the estimated count of affected SMEs 
noted earlier, and assuming an average of 10 employees per SME would suggest 150,000 to 200,000 
affected workers. Adding up these estimates would suggest a figure of 400,000 to 500,000 people on a 
conservative basis. Taking another approach, CSA data on urban employment levels can provide another 
approximation as these figures show the sector-by-sector breakdown of the 7.5mn employed urban 
persons in Ethiopia as of 2018 (Table 6). Applying a low-end/high-end range of 10 to 20 percent of this 
figure as potentially affected workers would suggest 750,000 to 1.5mn workers could be affected, or a 
midpoint of 1.1mn workers. Of course, not all of these employees are necessarily at risk of job losses, 
but an illustrative matrix showing different combinations of affected workers and the percent of those 
affected workers that could face job loss risks reveals magnitudes (taking a mid-range) on the order of 
330,000 to 560,000 people (Table 7).

Macroeconomic impacts: Quantifying Growth and Balance of Payments Impacts 
 
In attempting to quantify key macroeconomic impacts under a ‘limited virus spread scenario’, we review 
the comparative size of affected sectors and the implications of their decline or inactivity for balance of 
payments developments: 
 
• 
GDP impacts: sector-specific shocks: The sectors currently most affected by the corona virus 
pandemic—hospitality, flower/textile exports, manufacturers, banks—are generally not major 
components of GDP (Table 8). Hotels and restaurants make up 2.6 percent of GDP, while tourism is 
still a small share of the economy, at perhaps 4 or 5 percent—much less significant than, say, in a 
country like Kenya that will be severely hit. Total exports are just 2.8% of GDP, and flower/textile 
exports—despite impressive growth—even smaller at a combined 0.4% of GDP. Manufacturing is 
just 4 percent of GDP, while banking activity makes up 3 percent of GDP. Shutdowns of public 
schools/education (3.4% of GDP) and of public administration services (4.1% of GDP) might be seen 
as reducing aggregate economic activity, but as long as the vast number of public school teachers 
and public servants are being paid, their purchasing power is maintained and economic impacts 
limited. Perhaps most important, the two biggest sub-components of Ethiopia’s economy 
(agriculture at 36% of GDP and construction at 20% of GDP) should not be substantially affected 
under a ‘limited virus spread scenario’, i.e., if the virus does not expand nation-wide (particularly to 
food-growing areas) and if construction activity is not stopped via mandatory lock-downs.

GDP impacts: overall growth impacts: Given all the above considerations, we estimate that the 
corona virus’ impact would be at most 1 percentage point of GDP for 2019-20, as two-thirds of the 
fiscal year (up to February 2020) is essentially unaffected and only a subset of comparatively small 
sectors (cumulatively adding up to around 10-12 percent of GDP) are significantly affected for the 
remaining one-third of the year. This reduces growth from our previous expectation of 8 percent for 
2019-20 to just 7 percent. For upcoming fiscal year, given full-year effects, we think the impact will 
be more substantive at 2.5 percentage points of GDP, and we would thus reduce our growth 
projections from the 7.5 growth forecast at the beginning of 2020 to just 5.0 percent.2 Seen from 
the demand side of GDP, estimates of affected wage-related income/expenditure suggest that 
impacts from this source alone are likely to be on the order of 0.8 to 1.6 percent of GDP, based on a 
calculation that uses median salary levels for affected industries (Birr 3,000 per month) and potential 
numbers of affected persons ranging from 750,000 to 1.5mn being affected for a full year (Table 9).  
 
 
2 More precisely, for the current fiscal year, we assume affected sectors make up 15 percent of GDP experience a 20 percent drop in 
output in the last quarter of the fiscal year. For 2020-21, we assume that affected sectors still experience a 15 percent drop in output 
for the first six months, followed by a gradual recovery towards normal conditions (zero growth) for the second half of the fiscal year 
(January-June 2021).

Balance of Payments impacts, FY 2019-20: Foreign exchange inflows will surely show sharp declines 
in a number of categories, but the magnitudes are likely to be less severe than appear at first glance 
after accounting for various offsetting factors (i.e. on a net basis):  
 
o Declines in fx inflows—FY 2019-20: With global demand collapsing for many commodities 
and transport links also severely disrupted, immediate declines are certainly to be expected 
for several of Ethiopia’s exports—likely in the range of $300-$400mn during April-June 2020 
(from expected levels) considering impacts in the flower and textile sectors. Moreover, 
service exports will be hit sharply, including for Ethiopian Airlines revenue (about $1.5bn on 
an annualized basis if a 30 percent decline is applied from last year’s $4.1bn revenues) and 
for tourism (perhaps $500-$700mn if we assume a near-total stop of tourist inflows for the 
remainder of the fiscal year). Remittances will also likely fall as Ethiopians abroad face 
difficult employment/financial conditions abroad and thus send less funds to families here—
though this decline may be moderated by those who choose to maintain their past support 
or provide even greater support to affected families. Some portion of FDI inflows should also 
be expected to be put on hold as foreign investors—already cautious due to upcoming 
elections—find another reason to take a wait-and-see approach.  And finally, as the prospect 
of recording privatization inflows this fiscal year is now extremely remote (we had previously 
projected $1bn in flows for FY 2019-20), FDI inflows linked directly to these anticipated 
inflows will fall by the corresponding amount  
 
o Offsetting factors: Going against these anticipated fx declines, however, are several 
offsetting factors. Imports will tend to fall in line with lower FDI as well as with reduced 
consumer demand and lower manufacturing activity. If the collapse in oil prices is sustained 
for the coming year, this should—by itself—translate into around $1bn or more in reduced 
imports (given last year’s $2.6bn fuel import bill and global oil prices that are less than half

of last year’s levels, i.e. now $26 per barrel for Brent crude vs an average of $50-60 last year). 
Potentially increased grants will likely provide extra support (beyond already expected 
levels) from the World Bank and other multilaterals. Potential debt service rescheduling 
from G-20 bilateral lenders (as recently proposed and advocated by the IMF/WB) may 
provide yet another layer of external support beyond already assumed debt relief in 
Ethiopia’s case. The size of incremental grant and loan inflows may be limited for the few 
remaining months of the current fiscal year, but could become significant in 2020-21.    
 
o Overall BOP impacts and magnitudes: An estimation of the above effects is provided in 
Table 10, and shows our best efforts at quantifying the broad magnitudes involved. For 
exports, we now expect slightly negative growth this year (vs 8 percent growth anticipated 
pre-corona), and we also that expect a drop in remittance inflows will bring the year-end 
figure to just $5.1bn rather than a previously expected $6bn. These two factors contribute 
to a worsening of the current account this year to 4.6% of GDP vs 4.2% of GDP before. In the 
capital account, we expect a sharp drop in FDI to around $2.4bn for the year, though this 
mostly reflects the delay in privatization, and we assume that most other items in the capital 
account (namely government and public sector net foreign borrowing) remain at their 
previously expected levels. Reflecting the above factors, we project a year-end reserves 
figure of $2.6bn (down somewhat from $3bn in December 2019 and well below the $4bn 
we previously forecast for June 2020, largely due to the delayed privatization). Excluding 
privatization effects, the balance of payments is deteriorating only by around $500mn this 
fiscal year vs our expectations at the start of 2020 (reflecting the fact that the negative BOP 
impacts are only affecting the remaining few months of the fiscal year, namely March to 
June 2020).

o Exchange rate: Regarding the outlook for the Birr, as the exchange rate is not market 
determined, Ethiopia will not experience the sharp depreciations seen recently—given the 
global crisis—in countries such as Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa (Table 11A). Still, we 
expect the central bank will see the need to pursue a somewhat sharper pace of rate 
adjustment (versus its pre-corona trajectory) to help cope with the net negative balance of 
payments effects. Indeed, consistent with this view, the depreciation in March 2020 has 
picked up pace to a rate of 54 cents per month, more than double the 22 cents monthly 
depreciation seen in both January and February. Compared to year-ago levels, the rate is 
now exactly 15.2 percent lower (32.81 on March 31 vs 28.49 a year ago), and this magnitude 
of annual depreciation is likely—in our view—to remain within the central bank’s comfort 
range. On the basis of rate adjustments of near 50 cents per month up to the end of the 
fiscal year (justified also by recently higher-than-expected inflation outturns), we thus now 
expect a buying rate of 34.31 Birr/USD at end-June 2020 vs our previous slightly-less-
depreciated forecast of 33.16 Birr/USD (Table 11B).

Balance of Payments—Next Fiscal Year: For the upcoming fiscal year that starts in July 2020, we 
expect overall BOP impacts will be close to $1bn given the full year effects of lower remittances and 
lower service exports (including Ethiopian Airlines receipts). Needless to say, the impacts next fiscal 
year will depend critically on the speed and scale of the global recovery, especially—from Ethiopia’s 
perspective—in areas such as global air travel, remittances, and textile/flower exports.  As the basis

for our projections, we use what we think is a plausible scenario that includes: (1) a very slow and 
modest pick-up in export growth (just a 2 percent increase reflecting a slight recovery in early 2021); 
(2) an extended oil price drop that helps limit imports and the current account deficit; (3) the 
eventual conclusion of privatization sales in late 2020/early 2021 (thus boosting FDI to $4.4bn); and 
(4) a moderate increase in grants and low-interest loans from previously assumed levels (up from 
previous forecasts by $300-$400 mn for each).  Under these assumptions, gross fx reserves at end-
June 2021 should reach $3.4bn and our exchange rate assumptions—based on a near 15 percent 
annual average depreciation—would take the rate to 39.4 Birr/USD by end-June 2021 (Appendix 
Table). Considering both the last quarter of 2019-20 and all of 2020-21, the net corona-related 
balance of payments impact over this combined period will be near $1.5bn (Appendix). 
 
Policy interventions  
 
Targeted government initiatives are partly reflected in our macroeconomic projections above, as we are 
already starting to see policy interventions aimed at reducing income losses to businesses and job losses 
to workers. Indeed, we have assumed active public health measures will work at virus containment, that 
extra allocations will be made for public health facilities, and that at least some limited support to certain 
affected groups will be forthcoming. In this context, the mix of economic policy measures taken so far reveals 
the following:  
 
• 
Fiscal interventions—extra funding for health facilities, trade tax cuts for corona-related medical 
imports, and faster VAT refunds to business;  
• 
Monetary interventions—Birr 15bn in liquidity support to banks, priority fx allocations to corona-
related medical imports, higher limits on mobile money transfers; 
• 
Sector-specific interventions—removing a minimum price for flower exports ($3.8 per kg, intended 
to limit transfer pricing), and clamping down on ‘price gouging’ retailers to protect consumers.  
 
While clearly a positive start, an even broader and deeper set of interventions in these areas could 
potentially do more to reduce income and job losses—thus moderating the anticipated impacts above. 
Indeed, other country policy responses show aggressive actions being taken in both developed and 
developing countries. This is partly because—compared to Ethiopia—they are facing a larger incidence of the 
virus and because larger shares of their economy are currently impacted. Still, to help keep to a minimum 
the expected domestic shocks and attendant income/job losses, two key questions from a macro perspective 
are: (1) what more could Ethiopia do? and (2) how much more could it afford to do?  
 
In terms of possible policy initiatives, we tabulate the wide range of recent corona-related economic policy 
interventions with potential relevance for Ethiopia and highlight their size, forms, beneficiaries, and 
duration (Table 12):

Size of policy interventions—relative to GDP: Based on the above compilation and press reports, 
the size of policy interventions has ranged from a 1-4 percent of country GDP in most countries but 
has also been as high 10 percent of GDP in countries such as the US. These interventions are generally 
financed by budgetary re-allocations or by running larger fiscal deficits, especially in those countries 
with the room to do so and where interest rates are at very low levels. In Ethiopia’s case, coming out 
of a period of high debt servicing constraints limits the ability to resort to substantial new borrowing, 
but some combination of foreign grants/loans, domestic borrowing, and local fund-raising efforts are 
the available options.

• 
Instruments—fiscal, monetary, and sector-specific: Fiscal support has typically involved extra 
spending to assist those directly affected as well as changes in tax rates and rules (temporary waivers, 
faster refunds, tax exemptions); monetary support has generally involved providing banks with short-
term liquidity, interest rate changes, and regulatory forbearance (NPL provisioning rules); and sector 
support has taken the form of grants, loans, loan guarantees, debt service relief, debt write-off, and 
job creation/transition schemes for affected economic sub-sectors. Some notable and distinctive  
interventions seen from the cross-country experience include: cash grants to poor households, utility 
bill deferments for three months, temporary stamp duty and dividend tax reductions, 
postponements of capital gains taxes, dedicated credits to SMEs, temporary moratoriums on loans 
of affected businesses, and flexibility for banks in loan classification and provisioning requirements 
(Table 12).  
 
• 
Beneficiaries: Those assisted by public interventions have included a wide range of target 
beneficiaries—given varying approaches taken to give direct grants to households, wage support to 
keep workers employed, or support to affected businesses (such as airlines, tourism). 
 
• 
Duration: Country experiences in this area show a mix of one-time support, open-ended support that 
stays in place until conditions change, or a pre-defined duration announced upfront (e.g. 3 months). 
 
In the Ethiopian context, the sectors most eligible for support are—beyond direct assistance to public 
health facilities—hospitality and service businesses, exporters, certain manufacturers, and banks. 
Considering the range of policy interventions seen elsewhere, and in light of the early steps already taken, 
the potential directions/considerations for further policy support are as follows:  
 
• 
Support of health sector and public health initiatives: Early steps taken have focused on directly 
helping the health sector with extra Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and related resources—as 
appears to have been the case for the initial Birr 5bn allocation. To the extent that the virus case 
count increases, and health facilities begin to handle much larger numbers, the need to expand PPE 
and other equipment resources could rise rapidly. Annual budgetary health sector spending is Birr 
12.8 per year (5 percent of the federal government spending and 0.5% of GDP), and if we assume an 
incremental boost equal to 25 to 50 percent on the annual health budget this would translate to Birr 
3bn to 5bn in extra funds. 
 
• 
Support to workers: As far as we are aware, direct support to affected/laid off workers is not yet in 
place. In principle, and if funding were available, the existing urban safety net or similar schemes 
could be utilized to assist laid off workers with basic incomes for a transitional period. Taking a range 
of 750,000 to 1.5mn in affected workers (based on 10 to 25 percent of the employed urban 
population), and were a package of basic income support provided at near sector-specific minimum 
wages (around Birr 1,500 per month), then this would imply Birr 13bn to 27bn of support on an 
annual basis (around 0.3 to 0.7 percent of GDP). 
 
• 
Support to businesses: Direct support to private businesses has—in the Ethiopian context—largely 
been in the form of tax holidays and duty-free privileges rather than outright financial support. 
Current approaches taken in the flower sector appear to be a continuation of such non-financial 
forms of support, including industry-government understandings to limit layoffs (per press reports), 
removal of regulations such as minimum export prices, and encouragement to banks to voluntarily

postpone/reschedule the sector’s debt service payments. Over time, heavily affected sub-sectors 
(including hotel and selected service industries) may seek both regulatory relief as well as dedicated 
financial support, especially for those with significant roles in employment and foreign exchange 
generation. Were such active business support schemes to be put in place, and prioritizing the most 
heavily affected sectors (around 5 percent of GDP), potential amounts involved would be in the range 
of Birr 17bn to 34bn (0.5 to 1 percent of GDP) assuming aid packages equal to 10 to 20 percent of 
their GDP contribution. Unlike the case for workers, the forms of support provided to businesses 
would typically take the form of delayed tax payments, temporary credits, as well as loan guarantees, 
so the actual cash outlays and net costs to government could be considerably lower over time. 
 
• 
Support to banks: Short-term (repayable) liquidity support has become the most common form of 
central bank support to banks across the globe. In the Ethiopian context, effective loan-to-deposit 
ratios have been near or above 100 percent at most private banks (after accounting for reserve 
requirements and NBE Bill holdings), so they have effectively lent out all mobilized deposits, leaving 
little room for coping with sizeable cash withdrawals or other shocks. The amount of liquidity support 
offered so far is only 3.5 percent of total private bank deposits (which stood at Birr 401bn at end-
2019) and is also below what banks have placed at NBE in the form of reserve requirements (around 
Birr 20bn, given a 5 percent reserve requirement, which could potentially be released for liquidity 
purposes subject to inflationary considerations). A 5 to 10 percent liquidity buffer should generally 
be adequate for the operations of most banks (as they can also cut back on new lending to boost 
liquidity even if there is a slowdown in loan collections), and on that basis net liquidity support on 
the order of Birr 20 to 40bn may be seen as a more meaningful level of (repayable) support to private 
banks.  
 
• 
Support from/to the private sector: Potential forms of financial relief within the private sector can 
also make a significant difference, especially if encouraged by the public sector. Rental expenses, for 
example, are typically the highest share of an SME or service company’s monthly costs and some 
period of relief from (private and public) landlords could make a material impact in allowing 
businesses to continue as going concerns. To the extent that the government is the landlord for some 
portion of private business facilities, the scope for such forbearance is within the scope of public 
policies and could set an exemplary trend. 
 
In terms of the scale of the financing needed to permit the above policy interventions, a rough estimation 
of the magnitudes involved suggests an amount of near Birr 90bn would be required ($2.6bn or 2.3 percent 
of  GDP) for a ‘comprehensive support package’.  This estimate is a mid-point of a low-end and high-end 
case and includes assumed revenue shortfalls that government will encounter given weakened economic 
activity (Table 13). This illustrative ‘comprehensive support package’ covers areas where the government has 
conventionally provided past support (such as support to health facilities), but also unconventional 
government interventions (such as direct support to individual workers and businesses) that might now be 
considered given the exceptional nature of the economic disruption. The latter interventions are now 
increasingly common in a wide range of recent country cases following the corona pandemic, and may merit 
consideration in Ethiopia as well if the needed financing is potentially available. By our estimates, about 55 
percent of the resources needed for a ‘comprehensive support package’ can be secured via conventional 
financing sources (re-allocations of existing funds, domestic fund-raising efforts, somewhat higher grants, 
and somewhat higher foreign loans), but the remaining 45 percent would need exceptional resources (i.e. 
substantially higher grants/loans and/or exceptional debt service relief). Should such exceptional resources

19 
not be available, and if only conventional financing sources are on hand, available funding would largely be 
sufficient for extra public health spending and support to affected workers, but would have to exclude 
exceptional government assistance to affected SMEs/businesses. The basis for the above conclusions is 
elaborated below and in greater detail in Table 13:  
 
 
 
• 
Re-allocations of existing expenditure: Re-allocation of existing budget items is one immediate and 
available funding source (of course at the expense of some other government program). Ethiopia’s 
initial allocations of 5bn appears to have resorted to this funding source. Looking at this year’s 
Federal Budget, Birr 14bn had been set aside as contingency funds, though given where we are in 
the fiscal year, it may have already been used to date. Assuming an amount equal to the annual 
budget contingency can still be re-allocated away from lower priority spending items, then Birr 14bn 
could conceivably be mobilized for the various corona-fighting efforts.  
 
• 
Additional external funds—grants and loans:  Running a higher fiscal deficit by taking on more 
foreign loans is one source of additional funding. The scope here is somewhat limited for Ethiopia, 
however, as baseline borrowing plans (pre-corona) were already around $1.8bn for this fiscal year. 
Still, extra borrowing of in the range of $300-$500mn may be available and realistic, which would 
imply Birr 10bn-18bn in extra resources. If supplementary grants of $300mn-$500mn also become

available (the World Bank is allocating $14bn globally, which would imply 3-4 percent of those 
amounts for Ethiopia), then another Birr 10bn-15bn might be mobilized. Seeking external market 
funding is certainly not an option at this moment, not only because government has committed 
(including in the IMF program) to avoid such high-interest rate loans but also since the associated 
costs have jumped in recent weeks—the yield on Ethiopia’s sovereign bond is now up to 7.8% as of 
end-March 2020 from a low of 4.4 % just a few months ago. 
 
• 
Additional domestic borrowing: Funding options from domestic sources are generally quite limited 
at the moment: commercial banks have essentially lent out all their mobilized deposits and non-bank 
sources of financing (mainly pension funds) are fully invested in government T-Bills (Birr 115 bn as of 
late 2019) with limited new incremental funds generated. This leaves the central bank—and its ability 
for money creation—as the main source of domestic financing for the government, though the 
Government-IMF macro program recently sought to cap this at no more than Birr 20bn to limit 
inflationary risks. Assuming this amount can now be used given the exceptional circumstances, and 
noting that net government borrowing from the NBE was close to zero during the first half of the 
fiscal year (gross credit was up by 10bn but government deposits at NBE also up by a similar amount), 
then roughly Birr 20bn can be seen as available domestic financing—via NBE net lending to 
government—to fund the corona impacts. The deficit implications of this domestic borrowing (0.5 
percent of GDP), plus the foreign borrowing noted above (0.3 percent of GDP), would be a total of 
almost 1 percent of GDP.  
 
• 
NBE financial support: Separate from the fiscal considerations above, in the special case of NBE 
liquidity support, this can be secured from reserve requirement reductions and/or expanding NBE’s 
balance sheet. Both would need to be subject to potential inflationary considerations, but that may 
be less of an issue now given various deflationary effects being brought about by the economic crisis 
(high food inflation may still temporarily persist, however, given this is the ‘lean’ season for most 
food products and partial shutdowns may lead to more widespread upfront buying). As noted earlier, 
a 5 to 10 percent liquidity buffer is generally seen as adequate for bank asset-liability management 
purposes, and on that basis net liquidity support on the order of Birr 20 to 40bn would be a 
reasonable level for the private banking system to withstand expected shocks. For the large state 
bank, given its much larger absolute size, liquidity support of a smaller proportion may be sufficient 
given its deposit levels. Beyond liquidity support, a relaxation of certain regulatory requirements 
would be in line with many country practices at present: for example, temporarily tolerating breaches 
of the informal 5 percent NPL ceiling (as many banks may see this ratio rising to near double-digits) 
would deliver substantial relief both to the banks and their SME/corporate customers.

Conclusion 
 
Working with the assumption of a ‘limited virus spread scenario’ (severe disruptions to four economic sub-
sectors for the next three months followed by six months of a slow domestic/globally recovery), this note has 
attempted to identify the corona virus’ key macro impacts for Ethiopia and our sense of the magnitudes 
involved. A key conclusion is that even under a ‘limited virus spread scenario’, the economic impacts and costs 
are considerable: (1) growth would fall to 5 percent; (2) close to $1.5bn in net fx inflows will be lost; (3) between 
750,000 and 1.5mn jobs are potentially affected; (4) around Birr 27bn to 57bn in wage income could be 
threatened; (5) fiscal resources of up to Birr 90b (2.3% GDP) would be needed for comprehensive public 
assistance packages; and (6) central bank liquidity interventions on the order of Birr 47 bn (1.3% GDP) may be 
required.  
 
Given the highly unpredictable pattern of the virus’ spread, an even more adverse scenario cannot be ruled 
out, and the economic costs in that case would be several orders of magnitude higher. If case numbers in the 
coming days/weeks begin to rise exponentially and pass a critical ‘tipping point’ of say 500 or 1,000 cases, then 
we may see effects that cover a much wider geographic area (if the virus moves beyond Addis Ababa to regional 
capitals and food-growing rural areas) and that also threaten broader segments of the economy (such as 
construction and industry should these become subject to government lockdowns). Such a scenario would bring 
markedly different social and economic consequences (which we don’t venture to estimate at this point). 
However, on current trends, and given the scale and scope of public health measures actively being put in place, 
this adverse scenario seems to us to be a low probability event and has not formed the basis for our assessment.  
 
In concluding, we would make it a point to emphasize that, despite the near-term shocks which are inevitable 
under either scenario, the generally positive and encouraging trends seen in Ethiopia’s macroeconomy at the 
start of 2020 should not be forgotten—and may perhaps need repeated reminding. As highlighted in our 2020 
Macroeconomic Handbook, Ethiopia at the start of the year was coming out of a period of strong growth (9 
percent of GDP last fiscal year) and exhibited still high public and private investment levels that boded well for 
continued long-term growth. A new Government-IMF macro program was launched (and of course still in place) 
to help bring more conventional and disciplined macro policies, while also delivering substantially increased 
external funding via grants, low-interest loans, and rescheduling of upcoming debt service dues. Stricter controls 
that began to apply on government and state enterprise borrowing were (and are) setting the stage for improved 
credit and foreign exchange supplies to the private sector. Despite delays in some areas, structural reforms in 
the areas of privatization, ease of doing business, and the financial sector were also moving in a positive 
direction—for example, putting an end to mandatory Bill purchase requirements on banks, raising private sector 
credit to record levels, relaxing restrictive regulations in banking, and introducing for the first time market-based 
auctions for government debt. The main weak spots in the macroeconomy (pre-corona) continued to be high 
inflation and fx shortages, but both of these were priority areas under the new macro program with measures 
initiated for their eventual resolution. In short, in facing the global pandemic, Ethiopia is doing so from a position 
of relative strength—with strengthened state institutions (indispensable in this environment) now much more 
capable of mobilizing domestic and external resources, with a better macroeconomic framework and set of tools 
to navigate needed policy adjustments, and with a much closer engagement with its many multilateral and 
bilateral partners.  
 
A revised set of macroeconomic forecasts for the current fiscal year and for 2020-21 is included in the Summary 
Table at the end of this note.
