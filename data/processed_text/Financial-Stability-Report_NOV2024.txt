FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) issues this second Financial Stability Report in 
accordance with its responsibility to uphold a sound ﬁnancial system in Ethiopia. The 
report aims to promote ﬁnancial stability in the country by examining developments 
and risks in the ﬁnancial sector as well as the broader economy during the course of 
the past year. It is the second annual Financial Stability Report to be published by 
NBE and covers the period to June 2024 1, but it also addresses some major reforms 
and their efects in the period July to September 2024. In addition, it provides an 
outlook on issues potentially afecting the stability of Ethiopia’s ﬁnancial system in the 
remainder of 2024 and 2025.
The report examines external developments and risks to the economy and ﬁnancial 
sector posed by the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and other global shocks. It 
also highlights domestic factors, including the potential impacts of droughts and 
conﬂicts in parts of Ethiopia, and risks emanating from the ﬁnancial industry’s 
structure. In addition, the report assesses the limitations and contributions of the 
ﬁnancial sector’s infrastructure to its overall stability. The report provides a 
comprehensive analysis of the risks and resilience of Ethiopia’s banking sector, which 
still accounts for 96 percent of the ﬁnancial sector’s total assets as of June 2024.
According to the latest forecast by the Ministry of Planning and Development, 
following growth of 8.1 percent in 2023-24, the Ethiopian economy is expected to 
grow by 8.4 percent in 2024-25. The continued implementation of various 
macroeconomic, structural, and supply-side reforms under the second Homegrown 
Economic Reform (HGER 2.0) is expected to support higher growth and ease 
inﬂation over the medium term. Likewise, a signiﬁcant expansion in social and capital 
spending by government is envisaged over the coming year, without much 
deterioration in the ﬁscal deﬁcit, thanks to considerably improved revenue 
collections and a resumption in the inﬂux of donor grants and loans.  On the inﬂation 
front, continued tight monetary policies as well as strong agricultural output are 
anticipated to lead to gradually declining inﬂation over the course of 2025, despite a 
moderate and temporary spike that is likely over the coming months due to 
exchange rate pass-through efects. On the balance of payments front, a signiﬁcant 
improvement in the external position — including much improved foreign exchange 
reserves — is anticipated due to the recent exchange rate adjustment, a declining 
The report is based on ofcial data for Ethiopia’s ﬁscal year up to the end of June 2024, but it incorporates,     
where appropriate, more recent data up to October 2024.

trade deﬁcit, increased remittances, and rising capital inﬂows from ofcial and 
private sector sources.  Taken together, while the macroeconomic environment has 
shown broadly improving trends over the past year and is expected to show ongoing 
improvement over the course of 2025, potential headwinds are possible from policy 
eforts to reduce still-high inﬂation, security risks, and commodity price volatility.
Ethiopia’s banking sector remains stable and resilient. Risks in the reporting period 
were mostly moderate and stable, although the outlook overall points to increasing 
risk levels for ﬁnancial institutions due to external and domestic developments; 
nevertheless, the systemic risk-level remains limited. Credit risk is lower than the high 
credit concentration suggests, because loans to the private sector are relatively 
diversiﬁed. In addition, the credit risk stress test shows that even a severe shock 
would not pose a systemic threat. The banking industry as a whole is also found to 
exhibit low liquidity risk and shows resilience to short-term liquidity shocks, despite 
some downside risks. Conversely, operational risks are signiﬁcant in the banking 
industry and are expected to rise further in the short and medium term, with incidents 
of fraud, social engineering, insider threats and third-party risks on the rise. 
With respect to market and foreign exchange risks, except for a few heavily afected 
ﬁnancial institutions, the banking sector has also performed well during the 
adjustment of the birr exchange rate reform in July 2024.  
Considering these various threats to ﬁnancial stability, NBE directives have been 
issued in 2024 to reduce observed risks and to improve the resilience of banks to 
shocks in a number of areas. In particular, beyond the system-wide risks, directives 
put in place recently by NBE have sought to prevent and contain risks in key areas 
such as governance, asset classiﬁcation, lending to individuals with signiﬁcant 
inﬂuence, large exposures, and related party lending. NBE also continues to work 
with individual banks that are more exposed to these challenges, and struggle to 
cope with bank-speciﬁc risks. 
In the microﬁnance sector, the capital adequacy ratio, and liquidity ratio are all well 
within NBE’s parameters and have improved over the course of the review period. 
The capital goods ﬁnance sector’s risk rating is moderate, with low capital risk and 
moderate ratings for asset quality and systemic risk.

The insurance sector also remains resilient overall, but earnings and concentration 
risks are rated as high and may call for regulatory actions. Tighter regulatory 
standards on credit and deposit concentration risks are necessary, as indicated by 
the high concentration of loans and deposits. NBE intends to mitigate market risks by 
implementing prudent measures and enhancing governance standards and 
practices. These measures will also address the discrepancy between the proportion 
of ﬁxed rate assets and variable rate deposits. 
The Ethiopian ﬁnancial sector’s infrastructure is developing, but it requires further 
improvements in structural, operational, and technical efciencies. A more reﬁned 
and explicit standard for risk measurement in keeping with the rapidly evolving 
landscape of digital ﬁnancial technologies is one of the key policy developments 
anticipated to address the operational and technological threats that currently exist.

1. INTRODUCTION
1. INTRODUCTION
This 2024 Financial Stability Report is the second such document produced by NBE 
in line with its mandate to maintain a healthy ﬁnancial system in the country. 2 The 
report discusses trends in and risks to Ethiopia’s economy and ﬁnancial sector, 
focusing on developments in the reporting year 2023-2024 – but it also addresses 
important issues that have occurred up to September 2024, and details how and to 
what extent the ﬁnancial sector has been resilient, and whether it is expected to 
remain so. It also outlines recent policy and legal developments, as well as trends in 
the ﬁnancial system’s infrastructure that are expected to enhance the sector’s stability 
in the remainder of 2024 and 2025. 
The report is based on ofcial data for Ethiopia’s ﬁscal year to the end of June 20243  
and incorporates, where appropriate, IMF data released in October 2024.
The stability of Ethiopia’s ﬁnancial system is afected by multiple factors, from global 
to domestic ones. These include real economy factors, the structure and operation of 
the ﬁnancial sector and its sub-sectors, and the ﬁnancial system infrastructure. 
The following primary report chapters address each of these three groups: 
Chapter 2 addresses projected developments and those recorded in recent years, 
both in the global and local Ethiopian economies, drawing conclusions on how these 
developments constitute risks or stabilizing factors for the country’s ﬁnancial system; 
Chapter 3 analyzes Ethiopia’s ﬁnancial sector and its sub-sectors, identifying 
inherent risks to systemic stability; and 
Chapter 4 analyzes the ﬁnancial system’s infrastructure and related policy 
developments, as well as ﬁnancial inclusion and consumer protection, and their links 
with the stability of the country’s ﬁnancial system. Each major section ends with a 
summary risk assessment of the stability of Ethiopia’s ﬁnancial system.
See Article 4 of Proclamation No. 591/2008.
Ethiopia’s ﬁscal year starts on the 8th of July and ends on the 7th of July, but this report bases its analyses on 
data up to the 30th of June of each year.

The IMF’s most recent projections, released in October 2024, estimate global growth 
to decline slightly from 3.3 percent in 2023 to 3.2 percent in 2024 and remain at that 
latter rate in 2025. Economic activity has not yet returned to its pre-pandemic growth 
path. Advanced economies are anticipated to experience only slightly higher growth 
in 2024 and 2025, at 1.8 percent, compared to 1.7 percent in 2023. The United States 
shows stronger consumption and nonresidential investment while growth in the euro 
area improves due to better export performance, in particular of goods. Growth in 
emerging markets and developing economies is projected to decrease from 4.4 
percent in 2023 to 4.2 percent in 2024 and remain at that level in 2025 owing to 
persistent weakness in the real estate sector and low consumer conﬁdence in China 
(Figure 1).
In Sub-Saharan Africa, growth is expected to remain at 3.6 percent in 2024, the same 
as in 2023, and increase to 4.2 percent in 2025, as the adverse impacts of prior 
weather shocks abate, and supply constraints gradually ease. According to IMF 
projections, Ethiopia’s growth of 6.1 percent in 2024 4 and 6.5 percent in 2025 is 
lower than in 2023 (7.2 percent), but it nonetheless still positions the country among 
the 20 fastest-growing economies in the world (Figure 1).

According to the IMF, global annualized headline inﬂation is set to fall further, from 
an average of 6.7 percent in December 2023 to 5.8 percent in December 2024 and 
4.3 percent in December 2025, with advanced economies leading this decline. 
Headline inﬂation in emerging markets and developing economies is projected to 
decline from 8.1 percent in December 2023 to 7.9 percent in December 2024, and 
then fall at a faster pace to 5.9 percent in December 2025. In contrast, inﬂation 
forecasts for Sub-Saharan Africa remain in double-digit territory because of high 
inﬂation in some large economies, driven by the pass-through of currency 
depreciation and administrative price adjustments.
Except for Rwanda, which recorded 14 percent inﬂation year-on-year in December 
2023, annual inﬂation in most East African countries apart from Ethiopia remained in 
single digits in 2023, despite the shock to commodity prices following the wars in 
Ukraine and the Middle East, and other factors. Ethiopia’s inﬂation, which peaked in 
2022, is projected to decline further, from 30.2 percent in December 2023 to 21 
percent and 15 percent by the end of 2024 and 2025, respectively (Figure 2).
On July 9th, 2024, NBE announced the launch of a new monetary policy framework. 
Most notably, the NBE’s mandate has been clearly deﬁned to prioritize price stability 
relative to other goals. The framework contains the following four measures:
 
• NBE is using its policy interest rate (known as the national bank rate or NBR)  
 
   as the primary means of signaling its policy stance and inﬂuencing broader

   monetary and credit conditions. NBE is setting its initial policy interest rate  
 
   at 15 percent. 
 
•  NBE is conduct a monetary policy-related auction every two weeks. 
 
•  NBE has also introduced overnight lending and overnight deposit facilities  
 
   for banks that might need to manage their liquidity positions over just a   
 
   one-day time horizon.
Setting a benchmark policy rate, the start of open market auctions, and the 
introduction of overnight facilities for banks are important initiatives to help NBE fulﬁll 
the vital responsibilities – most notably to ensure price stability – set for it in its own 
strategic plan and NBE establishment proclamation.
Ethiopia's monetary policy reforms are helping to improve ﬁnancial stability in several 
ways by curbing inﬂation, modernizing the ﬁnancial sector, developing ﬁnancial 
market infrastructures among others.

Interest rate developments in 2024 mostly showed declining trends, reﬂecting 
reduced inﬂation and continued attempts to stimulate economic growth. For example, 
the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve cut policy rates from 4.5 
percent and 5.375 percent in December 2023 to 3.5 percent and 4.875 percent in 
September 2024, respectively, with most of the cuts coming afer June 2024 (Table 1). 
Most emerging economies also cut rates. Among the fewer countries increasing policy 
rates are Russia and Türkiye, while India held its policy rate constant. Russia’s central 
bank raised its benchmark interest rate from 16 percent to 19 percent as the 
government’s military spending strains the economy. Türkiye’s rate increased from 
42.5 percent in December 2023 to 50.0 percent in September 2024 as the Central 
Bank of Türkiye aims to tackle inﬂation. In Ethiopia, NBE has set its initial policy interest 
rate at 15 percent on July 9, 2024, due to the introduction of the new monetary policy 
framework on July 9th, 2024, to align its policy tools with global best practices.

Domestic factors impact on the health of the Ethiopian ﬁnancial system much more 
directly and signiﬁcantly than global conditions. According to NBE’s analysis, certain 
factors raise risks while others support stability and resilience. 
2.2.1. Economic Growth
Over the last ﬁve years, Ethiopia's economy has registered high growth, which is 
projected to continue in the coming years. Real GDP grew at above 6 percent each 
year, higher than the average growth for Sub-Saharan Africa (which is projected at 
3.6 percent in 2024 by IMF). Real GDP has grown by 8.1 percent in the year to the 
end of June 2024 and is anticipated to grow by 8.4 percent in 2024-25, driven 
equally by services, agriculture, and industry from the supply side, and by personal 
spending and investment from the demand side (Figure 3).
The composition of GDP continued to change gradually. The share of services in 
GDP in 2024 decreased slightly for the ﬁrst time in years to 40.2 percent, from 40.3 
percent in 2023, but it still surpasses the level of 39.5 percent recorded in 2020, 
which contracted as a result of COVID-19. The share of industry increased slightly – 
for the ﬁrst time since 2021 – from 28.8 percent in 2023 to 29.1 percent in 2024. 
The share of agriculture declined steadily from 32.7 percent in 2020 to 31.8 percent 
in 2024.

2.2 DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 5
5   Data for domestic economic conditions are all based on Ethiopian ﬁscal year which ended in June.
Overall, Ethiopia’s ﬁnancial institutions, and the ﬁnancial system at large, face a 
variety of risks due to reduced global economic growth and multiple 
macroeconomic and geopolitical shocks. These have contributed to double-digit 
inﬂation at home and afected the Ethiopian economy’s external position by driving 
up import costs and stiﬂing domestic economic activity and exports, thereby raising 
risks for ﬁnancial institutions in the country. Developments in the various foreign 
exchange markets and policy interest rates continue to constitute risks that ﬁnancial 
institutions face in Ethiopia, although the risk level has been reduced as a result of the 
exchange rate reform undertaken in July 2024.
Positively, though, global growth has proven remarkably resilient in the face of 
recurring shocks, rising geopolitical tensions, and violent conﬂicts.

2.2.2 Inﬂation, Interest Rate, and Yields
Over the last ﬁve years inﬂation has remained high. However, notwithstanding a 
number of unfavorable factors, such as inﬂation expectations, shortage of foreign 
currency, instability in parts of the country, and the rise in commodity prices, 
year-on-year inﬂation fell from 29.3 percent in June 2023 to 19.9 percent as of June 
2024 (Figure 4). Inﬂation continued to fall even afer the adoption of a 
market-determined exchange rate in July 2024, reaching 17.5 percent at the end of 
September 2024. In addition to the time lags involved to allow for the exchange rate 
efects to pass through to domestic prices, a large share of consumer prices followed 
the parallel market exchange rate and limited percent of imports in private 
consumption spending occurred at the ofcial exchange rate. Following the 
exchange rate reform, and taking into account anticipated pass-through efects, the 
IMF projects annual inﬂation will be around 24 percent in June 2025 and then fall to 
12 percent in June 2026. 
The domestic interest rate has remained stable and the yield on treasury bills has 
slightly increased. Commercial banks’ average long-term lending interest rates have 
been around 17 percent over the last four years (Figure 4). This has remained stable 
even afer the monetary and exchange rate reforms. However, the yearly weighted 
average yield on government treasury bills was 9.74 percent in 2024, slightly up 
from 9.7 percent in 2023 and more than double the 4.54 percent recorded in 2020. 
The yield has increased to 10.65 percent in the ﬁrst quarter of ﬁscal year 2024-25, 
which ended in September 2024. Both the long-term lending rate and yield have 
remained below inﬂation.

While the current account deﬁcit has been declining — relative to GDP — over the 
past few years, there was a widening gap (of nearly 100 percent as of June 2024) that 
emerged between the ofcial and parallel market exchange rates. To address this 
major distortion that was segmenting the foreign exchange market and substantially 
reducing foreign currency ﬂows into the banking system, an extensive reform of 
Ethiopia’s foreign exchange regime was initiated on July 29th, 2024. This reform 
aimed to fundamentally address Ethiopia’s balance of payments vulnerabilities in a 
comprehensive and sustainable manner (see Box 2), and it has since allowed the ofcial 
exchange rate to move steadily towards a market-determined exchange rate. 
On July 29th, 2024, NBE issued the Foreign Exchange Directive (FXD/01/2024) with 
immediate efect. Besides the move to a market-based determination of the exchange, 
this new directive included many other far-reaching measures, including:
 
•  Removal of foreign exchange surrender requirements to NBE.
 
•  Removal of more than 30 import restrictions.
 
•  Improved foreign exchange account retention rules for exporters.
 
•  Opening the sector to independent foreign exchange bureaus.
 
•  Allowing foreign exchange accounts for qualifying residents and 
 
    simpliﬁcation of foreign exchange account rules.
 
•  Allowing Ethiopian companies and banks easier access to foreign loans.
 
•  Enabling foreign participation in the upcoming Ethiopian 
 
    Securities Exchange.

• Granting special foreign exchange privileges to companies operating in   
 
   special economic zones.
By adopting a comprehensive approach, the foreign exchange reform is expected to 
address acute foreign exchange shortages, enhance export competitiveness, attract 
foreign direct investment, and complement multiple other macroeconomic reforms 
being put in place to enhance conditions for private sector enterprises to grow and 
thrive in the Ethiopian economy. 
Although a full-scale assessment of the foreign exchange regime’s reform would still 
be premature, the early results are positive and encouraging. The bank and parallel 
market exchange rates have largely converged (with the gap at or below 5 percent), 
allowing for a signiﬁcant shif of trading and foreign exchange activity towards the 
formal banking sector. Exports for the ﬁrst quarter are up 81 percent year-on-year 
while private remittances are up by 26 percent over the same period. Foreign 
exchange transaction volumes have risen steadily in the three months since the 
foreign exchange reform was introduced, with banks now making— on average 
—around US$500 million in monthly foreign exchange purchases and US$713 
million in monthly foreign exchange sales from/to their customers. Foreign exchange 
reserve levels at the central bank have risen by more than 240% at the end of 
October 2024 as compared to June 2024 levels, while foreign exchange reserves at 
commercial banks are also up substantially and stood at US$2.4 billion as of the end 
of October 2024. Higher foreign exchange reserves have allowed banks to 
signiﬁcantly reduce their net foreign exchange obligations (net short positions) and 
make increasingly greater allocations to business and consumers over the past few 
months. Reﬂecting these developments, and particularly a shrinking trade deﬁcit, the 
balance of payments is showing systemic improvement, with the current account 
balance in the ﬁrst quarter of the ﬁscal year (July-September 2024) turning into a 
surplus of US$573 million compared to a deﬁcit of US$1.258 billion in the same 
period last year.

2.2.4 Conclusion: Efects for Financial System Stability in Ethiopia
Overall, with major ﬁscal, monetary, and exchange rate reforms put in place in recent 
months, there is a broadly positive macroeconomic outlook for 2024-25. Moreover, the 
adopted macroeconomic stabilization measures have been put in place in a manner 
that minimizes adverse efects thanks to the inclusion of extensive mitigating measures 
(especially subsidies for fuel, fertilizers, edible oil and medicine as well as higher 
allocations for civil service salaries and safety net beneﬁts). The banking system should 
also beneﬁt from growth momentum, given expectations of record crop output, a jump 
in government social and capital spending, rising mining developments, and continued 
expansion in private sector services and tourism.  While the macro-outlook is thus 
generally favorable for the year ahead, some potential risks to the Ethiopian ﬁnancial 
sector may arise from the impact of tightening monetary policies, from domestic 
security risks, and from external factors such as commodity price volatility or shocks to 
global trade movements. Finally, the recently introduced NBE directives, which are 
intended to strengthen the ﬁnancial sector’s long-term viability, may impact ﬁnancial 
positions reported by banks in the short term, to the extent the new standards are 
signiﬁcantly diferent from the past practices of banks.  
2.2.3 Fiscal Operations and Public Debt 
Both public debt and the budget deﬁcit decreased in 2024 (Figure 6). Public external 
debt signiﬁcantly reduced from 17.2 percent of GDP in 2023 to 13.7 percent in 2024 
while public domestic debt decreased from 22.1 percent of GDP in 2023 to 18.7 
percent in 2024. The IMF projects external debt to reach 28.3 percent of GDP in 
2025, in response to the depreciation of the birr, and domestic debt to decline to 14.5 
percent of GDP, assuming that ﬁscal ﬁnancing through direct advances by NBE has 
been eliminated. Likewise, the budget deﬁcit decreased from 2.5 percent of GDP in 
2023 to 2.1 percent in 2024, as a result of signiﬁcant improvements in revenue 
growth, the implementation of the ﬁscal consolidation strategy, and the resumption of 
the inﬂux of donor funds. The IMF also predicts the budget deﬁcit to further decrease 
to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2025.

    AND RISK
This chapter analyzes 6 stability and risks in the Ethiopian ﬁnancial sector across the 
banking, microﬁnance and capital goods ﬁnancing, and insurance sectors, which are 
all regulated and supervised by NBE.  Policy actions taken by the government and the 
regulator remain supportive to the sector’s resilience and ﬁnancial stability.7
Ethiopia’s primary and secondary ﬁnancial markets are still in the early stages of 
development: the Capital Market Authority was established in June 2021, and the 
Ethiopian Securities Exchange is currently ﬁnalizing preparations to launch before the 
end of 2024.
At the end of June 2024, total assets of the ﬁnancial sector amounted to just over 
3,409 billion birr, 15.1 percent higher than a year earlier (Table 2). These assets 
constituted 29.5 percent of nominal GDP, compared with 37.6 percent at the end of 
June 2023. The banking sector continued to dominate the ﬁnancial sector, with its 
total assets accounting for 96.1 percent of total ﬁnancial sector assets at the end of 
June 2024 (similar to a year before). This implies that the stability of the Ethiopian 
ﬁnancial system largely depends on the health and stability of the banking sector. As 
a result, the banking sector is analyzed in more detail in the following sections.

3.2 BANKING SECTOR
3.2.1   Commercial Banking Industry
3.2.1.1   Role in the Economy
By the end of June 2024, 32 banks (all of them domestic) operated in Ethiopia. Of 
these, the Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE), a development ﬁnance institution, 
accounted for nearly 5 percent of the banking sector’s assets. The other institutions 
are made up of four fully-ﬂedged interest-free banks, six former microﬁnance 
institutions (MFIs) that graduated to commercial banks8, and 22 conventional 
commercial banks, including the country’s largest bank, the Commercial Bank of 
Ethiopia (CBE). Except for the DBE and CBE, all are private banks. As the following 
sections show, the banking sector is assessed as safe, sound, and stable as of the end 
of June 2024.
The banking sector is very important to the Ethiopian economy. Total deposits at the 
end of June 2024 reached nearly 2.5 trillion birr, and total loans and bonds of banks 
amounted to just under 2.2 trillion birr (Table 3). Both deposits and loans increased in 
the year to June 2024, albeit at lower rates than a year earlier: Total bank deposits 
grew by 15.4 percent, driven in particular by growth in demand for time deposits, 
compared to 24.6 percent in the year to June 2023. Similarly, loans and bonds grew 
by 16.1 percent to June 2024, down from the 24.3 percent annual growth rate 
recorded to June 2023. 
GDP increased at a faster rate than deposits and loans in the reporting period. As a 
result, the share of deposits in GDP decreased to 21.6 percent from 24.8 percent at 
the end of June 2023, and that of loans and bonds from 21.7 percent to 19.0 percent. 
The share of loans in GDP is low by international comparison, and the objective is to 
increase it signiﬁcantly in the medium term, thereby also reducing credit 
concentration risk (see Section 3.2.1.3 below). A related positive development in this 
regard is the shif in the loan portfolio. Since 2021, total outstanding loans to the 
private sector have exceeded loans to the public sector.
Total assets of commercial banks reached 3.3 trillion birr at the end of June 2024 – 
an increase of 15.2 percent from the previous year; the growth rate is less than the 
19.9 percent recorded in June 2023. The major contributors to total assets growth 
were loans and advances, and bonds, which together accounted for the largest share 
(66.9 percent) of total assets.

In line with international trends, Ethiopia established a deposit insurance scheme in 
2021. By reducing the likelihood of a “run” on the banks and microﬁnance institutions, 
this is expected to contribute signiﬁcantly to stability in the banking and microﬁnance 
sectors and, hence, to the overall ﬁnancial system. Beyond the traditional banking and 
MFI sub-sectors, Ethiopia’s ﬁnancial sector is set to be transformed in its size and 
scope with the imminent launch of the ﬁrst organized securities exchange, the 
Ethiopian Securities Exchange (See Box 3).
Table 3: Banks' Major Balance Sheet Items (billion Birr)
Box 3: 
Capital Market Developments and the Launch of the 
Ethiopian Securities Exchange (ESX)
The development of the capital market’s ecosystem has recorded signiﬁcant strides since 
2019 when NBE began spearheading it through various foundational initiatives. NBE 
played the primary role in introducing the Ethiopian Capital Market Proclamation 
1248/202, and established a dedicated project team that was tasked with laying down the 
basis to create the Ethiopian Capital Market Authority and the Central Securities 
Depository (CSD). The government, through Ethiopian Investment Holdings, also 
championed the establishment of the Ethiopian Securities Exchange (ESX), which is 
expected to be formally launched soon.
The capital market’s establishment plays an indispensable role in achieving development 
goals by providing the public and private sectors with access to long-term ﬁnancing. Its 
presence enhances ﬁnancial avenues and introduces innovative instruments that improve 
access to ﬁnance and promote savings and investment. For the private sector, these 
markets ofer risk-based, patient, long-term capital, fostering growth and development. 
This process also signiﬁcantly elevates the standards of ﬁnancial reporting, corporate 
governance, and disclosure practices, enhancing the overall ﬁnancial and accounting 
capacity of the nation. Equally important is the role of the capital market in bolstering

3.2.1.2   Industry Structure and Systemic Risk
Of the 31 commercial banks registered by the end of June 2024 in Ethiopia, one is a 
state-owned bank; four are private interest-free banks; 9 six are MFIs transformed into 
commercial banks; and the rest are conventional private commercial banks.
Based on asset size, NBE distinguishes three types of commercial banks: large, 
medium, and small banks. Their respective roles in, and share of, the market (Table 4) 
are as follows:

domestic ﬁnancing for the public sector. Access to debt ﬁnancing via bonds issued on the 
domestic capital market gives the government of Ethiopia efcient avenues for raising 
domestic ﬁnancing, which complements NBE’s monetary policy reforms.
The Ethiopian Capital Market Authority has, to date, played an active role in laying down 
the relevant legal and regulatory framework to establish a safe, transparent, and efcient 
capital market. The introduction of directives regulating the manner with which securities 
are issued and traded, the licensing of capital market service providers, securities 
exchanges, and over-the-counter platforms, play a critical role in introducing order, 
transparency, and efciency in the operation of the nation’s capital market.  
Most importantly, the imminent launch of the ESX marks a pivotal milestone in the 
Ethiopian capital market ecosystem’s development. As the ﬁrst organized securities 
exchange in the nation, established through a partnership between the public and private 
sectors, ESX is poised to play a crucial role in advancing the government’s economic 
reform agenda. Its formation signiﬁes a transformative step towards enhancing the 
resilience and inclusivity of the ﬁnancial sector, positioning Ethiopia on a new trajectory of 
ﬁnancial modernization and integration. 
ESX will be a fully electronic and modern market from its launch. The exchange’s modern 
Automated Trading System, which is integrated with NBE’s CSD, will transform the 
hitherto manual securities trading environment into a high-speed, efcient electronic 
marketplace. The introduction of modern broker-back ofce and order management 
systems that include mobile trading applications will allow Ethiopians across the country 
to directly participate in the market, there by democratizing the capital market ecosystem.
The multifaceted signiﬁcance of the ESX for the ﬁnancial sector is evidenced by the fact 
that, ahead of its launch, the exchange is currently serving as the market infrastructure 
and technology platform for the interbank money market – which was launched by NBE 
and commercial banks in November 2024. The introduction of this electronic interbank 
money market is expected to play a pivotal role in enhancing the transparency, reliability 
and efciency of the money market, thereby boosting the ﬁnancial sector’s overall 
liquidity. With the launch of a money market through an online platform administered by 
ESX, banks can now lend to and borrow from each other on a modern electronic 
platform. Within the ﬁrst three weeks of its operation the market transacted more than 20 
billion birr, signifying its immense potential.

Table 4: Banking Industry Market Shares, June 2024 versus June 2023 (percent)
Large Bank: The only large bank in the country is the state-owned CBE. Although its 
market share declined from the previous year, CBE still remains a systemically 
important bank. At the end of June 2024, its total assets and deposits constituted just 
under half (47.9 percent and 47.1 percent, respectively) of the whole banking sector. 
However, its total capital accounted for just less than a quarter (24.2 percent) of the 
total. 
Medium Banks: The combined share of the ﬁve medium-sized banks 10 in the industry 
increased for all key balance sheet items in the year to the end of June 2024 
compared to a year earlier: combined assets went from 28.0 percent to 28.9 percent 
of the sector’s total assets, total deposits from 29.4 percent to 30.3 percent of the 
sector’s total, and capital from 31.0 percent to 33.0 percent. Nevertheless, no 
medium-sized bank is currently regarded as a systemically important bank, despite 
the growing market share.
Small Banks: At the end of June 2024, the combined assets and deposits of the 25 
small banks 11 accounted for 23.3 percent and 22.7 percent, respectively, of the whole 
banking sector – an annual increase of 0.8 percentage points each. Likewise, their 
combined total capital share increased from 41.6 percent of the sector’s total capital 
in 2023 to 42.8 percent at the end of June 2024. The growth of the small banks’ 
aggregate market share can be explained by their increasing number over the years 
and the rapid initial expansion of the newly established banks. However, with an 
individual share in assets, deposits, and loans, and bonds of less than two percent, 
none of the small banks can be considered a systemically important bank.

Assessment of Systemic Risk Stemming from Industry Structure
As indicated above, CBE is a systemic bank in the Ethiopian banking system and can 
therefore entail systemic risk. The CBE has withstood a number of recent negative 
domestic and external shocks, including local conﬂicts and droughts/landslides, 
global inﬂation, disruptions to the supply chain brought on by the war in Ukraine and 
the Middle East, changes in the price of oil and other commodities, climate change 
and other impactful developments.
The CBE has a high cushion of regulatory capacity as its capital adequacy ratio (CAR) 
is signiﬁcantly above NBE’s 8 percent minimum capital requirement, and its liquidity 
position is also high, above the 15 percent minimum requirement. While CBE’s CAR 
remains above the regulatory minima at all levels of risk stress, its liquidity position 
could fall below the regulatory minimum in the (unlikely) event of a sudden withdrawal 
by its 10 most important depositors (see Section 3.2.1.5).
Moreover, because the majority of the bank’s paid-up capital is a government-issued 
promissory bond (Proclamation No. 994/2017 Government Bond) that has not yet 
been fully paid for in cash, CBE’s capital position requires targeted policy and 
regulatory attention in the event of unfavorable circumstances. CBE’s exposure to 
government-guaranteed but nonperforming exposures to Liability and Asset 
Management Company (LAMC) and Ethiopia Electric Power (EEP) are being replaced 
with government bonds resulting in the removal of these items from CBE balance 
sheet and restructuring of its balance sheet accordingly. NBE will be following up the 
proper implementation of this in due course.

FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT
NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA
Box 4: 
Commercial Bank of Ethiopia’s Resolution
Accounting for around 50 percent of Ethiopia’s banking industry in terms of market share 
of its assets and deposit base, Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE), with its wide 
geographical coverage and presence, is systemically important and the longest serving 
bank in the country. CBE has played a central role in Ethiopia’s economic growth and 
development since its establishment. However, its past overexposure to projects run by 
public sector organizations has put the bank under stress.
Cognizant of the need to address its problems and ensure a sustainable business model 
that best supports economic growth and development, the Ethiopian government 
embarked on a major reform program at CBE. To support its reform agenda, the 
government is also working with the World Bank to efectively implement and realize 
these necessary changes under the auspices of a ﬁnancial sector strengthening project 
(FSSP).
3.2.1.3 
Credit Concentration
24
FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT
NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA
A. 
Credit Concentration by Economic Sector
As with the year before, manufacturing accounted for Ethiopian banks’ largest share 
of loans and advances (23.0 percent) at the end of June 2024, followed by domestic 
trade and services, with 20.1 percent (Table 5). However, both showed lower growth 
than total banking loans. However, the largest changes in the composition of credit 
over the year were around the decline in credit to the export sector – a drop by 1.6 
percentage points, and almost stagnation in terms of loan value – and the increases 
in loans to consumers (plus 1.3 percentage points) and the building and construction 
The FSSP, which is spearheaded by the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank of 
Ethiopia (NBE), and ﬁnanced by the World Bank, is designed to a large extent to ensure 
the successful restructuring, recapitalization and reform of CBE. The restructuring aims to 
reduce CBE’s exposure to nonperforming state-owned enterprise assets by transferring 
the stock of loans owed by the Liability and Asset Management Company (LAMC) and 
Ethiopian Electric Power (EEP) to the government. In addition, a subsequent recapitaliza-
tion exercise aims to increase CBE’s capital in line with its systemic importance in the 
sector. Accordingly, the House of People’s Representatives approved a government-pro-
posed bill to issue bonds worth 900 billion birr to CBE. This was to ensure the assumption 
of these state enterprises’ debts by the government and the injection of additional capital 
to CBE. The transfer of the debts from LAMC and EEP to the government does not 
change the public sector’s total exposure to debt, as this is not a new obligation. Instead, 
it makes the debt the government’s responsibility rather than the two public enterprises’.  
To support the implementation of this reform program, the World Bank is expected to 
approve concessional ﬁnancing worth US$700 million to further strengthen the banking 
sector’s supervision framework and its regulations. The funds will also support the recapi-
talization of CBE and the various reform activities that each of the implementing agencies 
(i.e., NBE, CBE and DBE) will undertake. Meanwhile, as part of the reform activities, CBE 
will redeﬁne its governance and operating model in a way that ensures its commercial 
mandate, conduct its future operations in a prudent and sustainable manner, ensure com-
pliance with applicable NBE regulations (including on corporate governance and risk 
management), implement recommendations of an asset quality review, and pursue 
various cost optimization measures.  
In short, the implementation of the CBE reforms is expected to ensure the bank’s 
improved ﬁnancial soundness and sustainability and further cement the contribution it 
makes towards supporting private sector-led economic growth and development going 
forward.
Overall, the risk stemming from the concentration of the industry’s structure has 
continued to gradually decline in the reporting year, as the market share of the one 
systemically important bank further decreased.

Overall, as a result of the sectoral shifs, the concentration of the loan portfolio across 
sectors – which had already been relatively diversiﬁed in the year to June 2023 – 
decreased further during the reporting period.
B. 
Credit Concentration by Borrowers
The banking sector’s loans and advances are relatively concentrated due to the past 
practice of large-scale lending to major state enterprises and regional governments.
If including such large state-owned enterprises, the top 10 borrowers in the banking 
industry held 14.7 percent of its total loans and advances at the end of June 2024, a 
signiﬁcantly lower share than a year earlier (23.5 percent). However, excluding 
state-owned enterprises, concentration ratios are much lower, with the top 10 private 
borrowers making up 3.5 percent of bank loans and advances.  Large borrowers, 
deﬁned as those with credit exposure of above 10 million birr, constituted only 0.5 
percent of the total, but they held almost three quarters (74.8 percent) of the entire 
banking sector loans. This is a higher share than the year before. A signiﬁcant number 
of loans at the end of June 2024 was held by borrowers from urban areas.12 
Looking ahead, as banks work to comply with the credit granting conditions in the 
revised NBE directives, it is expected that credit concentration risk in the banking 
sector will be gradually reduced. The relevant regulatory changes in this respect 
include accurate mapping of connected borrowers and compliance with the 
corresponding quantitative prudential limits stipulated in the Large Exposures 
Directive. In addition, the changes involve the application of revised criteria to identify 
related parties and their compliance with the corresponding quantitative prudential 
limits as stipulated in the Related Party Transaction Directive (for more detail, see 
Section 3.2.3 below).

Soundness Indicators
The commercial banking industry in Ethiopia is considered sound and resilient based 
on an assessment of these ﬁnancial soundness indicators – capital adequacy ratio, 
liquidity position, and non-performing loans (NPLs).
A. Asset Quality Indicators
As a result of low NPLs and adequate provisioning for them, the quality of assets in 
the Ethiopian commercial banking industry was generally sound at the end of June 
2024, despite indicators preforming slightly worse compared to a year earlier.
The ratio of NPLs to gross loans increased slightly in the year to the end of June 
2024 to 3.9 percent, from 3.6 percent for the same period in 2023 (Figure 7a), still 
substantially below the regulatory maximum of 5 percent. Nevertheless, in a few 
banks NPLs rose above this minimum. As a result, NBE is working with them to 
address the underlying challenges.
Furthermore, provisioning decreased from 132.5 percent of NPLs at the end of June 
2023 to 104.1 percent at year later (Figure 7b), though still fully covering all reported 
NPLs. Given the reported level of NPLs, banks have provided adequate provisions to 
cover their impaired loans.
It should be noted that the revised directive on asset classiﬁcation and provisioning, 
issued by NBE in June 2024, will lead to improved and more prudent measures in 
terms of asset classiﬁcation and the maintenance of the required provisioning (see 
Section 3.2.3 below). This is expected to further improve the banking system’s 
classiﬁcation and NPL reporting.

B.  Capital Adequacy Indicators
The regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets ratio for the banking sector slightly 
increased from 14.7 percent at the end of June 2023 to 15.4 percent in June 2024, 
comparing favorably with the regulatory minimum of 8 percent. Meanwhile, the 
leverage ratio (capital to total assets) continued its steady positive trend, increasing 
from 8.1 percent to 8.4 percent (Figure 8).

Source: NBE Database 
C. Liquidity Indicators
Although the liquid assets to deposits ratio of the banking sector decreased from 
24.2 percent at the end of June 2023 to 22.4 percent a year later, it still compared 
favorably with the regulatory minimum of 15 percent (Figure 9).
During the same period, the ratio of loans to deposits remained stable, dropping by 
only 0.4 percentage points to 60.2 percent, while the ratio of loans and bonds to 
deposits increased slightly to 87.9 percent, from 87.4 percent in the previous year 
(Table 3 above). These ratios are still very high, though, and suggest that nearly all 
deposits are held up by borrowers, leaving limited room for large and unexpected 
deposit withdrawals. Nevertheless, the high ratios result in relatively low liquid assets, 
which could lead to a liquidity problem under unfavorable circumstances.
The decrease in the liquidity ratio may have been caused by increased lending, 
particularly to the building and construction, import, and households’ sectors (see 
Table 5 above). Although the increased lending is in line with the general policy to 
encourage lending to the economy’s key sectors, NBE continues to caution going 
above a loan to deposit ratio of 85 percent to ensure the sector remains resilient to 
adverse liquidity shocks.

Figure 9: Banking Industry Liquidity Indicators (percent)
Source: NBE Database 
A high concentration of deposits and the diference in maturities between deposits and 
loans may create a liquidity risk in the banking sector despite the existing 
above-the-minimum liquidity ratio: At the end of June 2024, 58.5 percent of the total 
banking sector deposits was held by only 0.4 percent of the sector’s depositors. 
However, similar to credit concentration, state-owned enterprises are among the largest 
depositors, so the concentration of private sector deposits is considerably smaller. The 
liquid assets of banks only incorporated a small share of high-quality liquid assets (cash). 
As a result, some banks were facing real-time transaction-level liquidity shortages. This 
is analyzed further as part of the liquidity risk stress test in Section 3.2.1.5.
D. 
Proﬁtability Indicators
The total income of the banking sector was 361.4 billion birr for the year to the end of 
June 2024, up from 297.5 billion birr in the previous year (Figure 10). Expenses also 
grew with the expansion of activities, and the total number of bank employees rose by 
2.9 percent to 192,843 people. Net income before tax increased by 18.4 percent to 57.9 
billion birr at end of June 2024, against 48.9 billion birr a year earlier.

Risk Stress Tests
A. Credit Risk Stress Test
NBE performed a banking sector credit risk stress test at end of June 2024 for the 12 
months ahead under baseline, moderate and severe scenarios. The scenarios were 
calibrated according to domestic and international shocks that could negatively 
impact the recovery and, eventually, the credit risk of the banking industry. 13
The baseline scenario (pre-shock) assumes that the NPL ratio will not change from 
the current 3.9 percent level, anticipating that the economy will grow according to the 
IMF’s forecast, with international and domestic conditions improving, and the country 
free of droughts and conﬂicts. The moderate scenario assumes that NPLs in the 
banking industry will increase to 10.0 percent. In principle, this could happen as a 
result of deteriorating domestic and/or external circumstances, such as drought and 
heightened conﬂict or increasing foreign currency shortages. The severe scenario 
assumes that NPLs will increase to 30.0 percent.

The proﬁtability of the banking industry decreased slightly but is considered sufcient. 
Return on equity and return on assets were 24.6 percent and 2.0 percent at the end of 
June 2024 respectively, compared to 25.7 percent and 2.0 percent a year earlier 
(Figure 11). Return on equity was marginally lower than that of the previous year primarily 
because of an increase in bank provisioning.
Table 6: Results of Credit Risk Stress Test (increase in non-performing loans)
Source: Developed from NBE Database and Of-site Reports
The credit risk stress test results (Table 6) provide an assessment of banks’ capital 
erosion following assets quality impairment under the moderate and severe 
scenarios. The results indicate that all banks have sufcient capital to withstand a 
moderate shock. Under the severe scenario, the aggregate CAR of the banking 
sector would still remain well above the regulatory minimum of 8.0 percent, at 12.3 
percent. However, four banks would fail the stress test due to an increase in NPLs 
under this scenario, requiring additional capital equal to 6.5 billion birr (4.8 percent 
of risk-weighted assets). This is a marked improvement compared to the situation a 
year earlier, when 12 banks would have fallen below the regulatory minimum CAR. 
The systemic bank – and the majority of MFIs that converted to banks, in the small 
banks class – have more capital and would not require capital injections under the 
severe scenario. Therefore, there is no systemic credit risk for the banking sector as a 
whole, even under the severe scenario.
B. Liquidity Risk Stress Test
The liquidity risk stress test considers the aggregate impact on the banking sector’s 
liquidity if the top 10 depositors in each bank suddenly withdraw all their money. This 
is an extreme scenario because, as mentioned in section 3.2.1.3, state-owned 
enterprises are among the largest depositors and would be highly unlikely to fully 
withdraw deposits simultaneously.
The results of the stress test (Table 7) suggest that the Ethiopian commercial banking 
sector is highly sensitive to liquidity risk from sudden withdrawals by a few big 
depositors. The banking industry had also become more sensitive by the end of June 
2024 than the previous year. Exposed to the same shock, 18 banks would have failed to 
meet the minimum liquidity requirements of June 2023; this has now increased to 20.

At the same time, as already noted in Section 3.2.1.3, the revised NBE directives that 
aim to reduce credit concentration in the banking sector will also gradually reduce 
liquidity risk. Measures to enhance accurate mapping of large borrowers and 
compliance with the corresponding quantitative limits stipulated in the Large 
Exposures Directive will reduce banks’ exposure to large depositors (see Section 3.2.3 
below). So too will the application of revised criteria on the identiﬁcation of related 
parties and compliance with the corresponding quantitative limits as stipulated in the 
Related Party Transaction Directive.
C. 
Foreign Exchange Stress Test
Following the reform of the foreign exchange regime undertaken in late July 2024, 
the value of the birr against the US dollar decreased by more than 100 percent, from 
about 57 birr per dollar to about 117 birr per dollar. With few exceptions, the banking 
system weathered this shock well. As a further depreciation of the birr is possible 
under adverse conditions, NBE undertook a foreign exchange rate stress test. This 
analyses the efects of a further increase in the exchange rate by 10 percent, 20 
percent, and 30 percent. Considering the birr exchange rate has already adjusted 
following the introduction of the foreign exchange regime reform, a further 
depreciation during the year ahead under the latter two scenarios must be considered 
as unlikely.
The results of the stress test indicate the banking industry CAR will remain above the 
minimum regulatory requirement of 8.0 percent under all scenarios. Although one 
bank would fail to meet the minimum CAR requirement under the 30.0 percent 
increase scenario (Table 8).

3.2.2  Development Finance Institution
The total assets 14 of the DBE grew by 15.5 percent from the previous year to 182.2 
billion birr at end of June 2024. The increase was largely because of the growth in 
bonds by 131.3 percent. Total regulatory capital increased by 6.5 percent from the 
previous year’s 31.0 billion birr to 33.0 billion birr (see Annex A). Deposit liabilities 
decreased signiﬁcantly by 56.3 percent, the regulatory capital ratio fell to 23.9 
percent, and the ratio of provisions to NPLs also fell by 45.0 percent by the end of 
June 2024, compared with the same period a year earlier. The ratio of NPLs to total 
loans decreased, from 7.1 percent to 6.5 percent (Figure 12). Proﬁtability also 
marginally decreased, with a return on assets of 2.5 percent, and a return on capital 
of 13.3 percent (Figure 13).
Overall, the vulnerability of DBE to risks decreased substantially during the review period.

3.2.3 Regulatory Enhancements in the Banking Sector
In June 2024, NBE issued ﬁve revised directives on banking business, as informed by 
international best practice, mainly embodied in the Basel Framework, as well as in 
response to developments in the banking industry. The directives are also meant to 
address speciﬁc corporate governance and risk management weaknesses existing in 
some banks. Such weaknesses involve poor objectivity and insufcient competence 
at board level, including a lack of independent directors and the under-estimation of 
credit risk concentration due to the poor identiﬁcation of connected borrowers. In 
addition, there is an under-estimation of insider lending due to the exclusion of 
relationship through ownership: for example, the relationship between state-owned 
banks and enterprises. Lastly, there is inadequate prudential provisioning for loan 
losses, leading to the overstatement of proﬁts, due to the improper grading of 
exposures.
To ensure that operations of afected banks are not disrupted in a bid to comply with 
the revised directives, NBE has allowed transitional arrangements for each of the ﬁve 
directives as appropriate. 
Overall, the revised directives are expected to lead to a signiﬁcant improvement in the 
safety and soundness of the banking sector and the banks’ intermediary role in the 
economy, enhanced ﬁnancial stability, and ultimately provide a boost to economic 
prosperity in Ethiopia
3.2.3.1 
Directives on Corporate Governance 
In a bid to strengthen its supervisory framework, NBE revised directives on bank 
corporate governance and requirements for persons with signiﬁcant inﬂuence in a 
bank.
1. Bank Corporate Governance Directive. To enhance corporate objectivity, 
accountability and transparency, banks are now required to have independent 
directors. The process to nominate and elect directors has also been streamlined to 
make it more efcient. Lastly, in recognition of inclusion and diversity, a bank board 
of directors should have at least two women directors. 
2. Requirements for Persons with Signiﬁcant Inﬂuence in a Bank Directive. To 
ensure the banking sector’s integrity as well as its stable and long-term institutional 
success, NBE tightened the ﬁtness and propriety requirements for banks’ directors 
and management. The revised requirements include limiting the number of 
directorships; ensuring senior bankers make the necessary time commitment, are 
independence of mind, and manage conﬂict of interest; and seeking higher 
qualiﬁcations and relevant experience for the chief executive ofcer of a bank and 
directors.

FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT
NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA
3.2.3.3 Other banking business regulatory and supervisory reforms
In addition to monitoring the implementation of the above-mentioned ﬁve directives, 
NBE is currently working on other reforms aimed at strengthening its banking 
regulatory and supervision processes to align them with international best practice 
and ensure their continuous improvement. 
In the review period, the banking sector remained stable and resilient against the 
backdrop of strong domestic economic growth, efective monetary and ﬁnancial 
policies, but also conﬂicts and droughts in some parts of the country. Overall, the 
outlook for 2024/2025 is also positive. Underpinned by sufcient capital and 
proﬁtability, the sector will remain stable and resilient, which is also conﬁrmed by the 
3.2.3.2 
Directives on Credit Risk Management 
As part of guidance to banks in the management of credit risk, concentration risk, and 
conﬂict of interest, NBE revised directives on large exposures, asset classiﬁcation and 
provisioning; and related party transactions.
1. 
Large Exposures Directive. To reduce vulnerabilities due to concentrated 
lending, banks are required to observe limits when lending to an individual borrower 
or group of connected borrowers, as well as maintaining internal mechanisms to 
monitor such concentration risk. In this directive, NBE clariﬁed the criteria for 
identifying connected borrowers, and stipulated exempted categories of borrowers, 
to ensure that concentration risk is accurately determined.
2. 
Asset Classiﬁcation and Provisioning Directive. To ensure that credit risk 
arising from loans and other assets is accurately measured, and provided for in a 
timely manner consistent with accepted international accounting principles and 
regulatory standards, NBE tightened the conditions for how banks grade loans and 
treat and report restructured loans and NPLs. The directive also sets maximum limits 
for loan iteration and the treatment of NPLs, including the maintenance of provisions 
for of-balance sheet exposures.
3. 
Related Party Transactions Directive. Related parties are persons 
connected with the bank either through control and/or employment. This directive 
limits the sum of all exposures directly or indirectly held by a bank to any single related 
party, and forbids a bank to conduct any transactions with a related party on 
preferential terms compared to conditions normally applied to unrelated parties.
3.2.4 Summary Assessment of Risks for Financial System 
            Stability Emanating from the Banking Sector
latest banking sector risk stress test results. However, there are some downside risks 
associated with potential domestic and external shocks.
A. 
Credit Risk
The banking industry’s credit risk remained moderate during the review period 
but is expected to increase in 2024/2025.  Credit risk could increase because of 
conﬂicts in some parts of the country. In addition, a deterioration in the external sector 
– the implication of the global monetary policy on domestic interest rates, the 
exchange rate and capital ﬂows; and the impact of the wars in Ukraine and the Middle 
East on trade and other transactions – could also increase credit risk. This risk 
appears to be accentuated at face value by the high levels of credit concentration. 
However, it is lower in practice when the role of state-owned enterprises in the 
banking system’s loan portfolio is considered. Also, NBE is closely monitoring this 
situation through supervisory tools contained in the revised directives on large 
exposures and related party transactions, issued in June 2024. 
Since loans, advances, and bonds constitute the lion’s share of bank assets, credit risk 
remains one of the most important and inherent risks that banks need to efectively 
manage. Therefore, it is imperative to follow prudent, principle-based lending and 
ﬁnancing practices that are in line with a bank’s risk strategy and appetite, as well as 
applicable legal requirements. In this regard, the asset quality of Ethiopia’s banking 
system as a whole and of most banks is deemed satisfactory as their NPL ratio is 
below NBE’s 5.0 percent maximum. However, in light of the aforementioned systemic 
risks and the less than satisfactory performance of some banks, NBE is closely 
monitoring ﬁnancial institutions with relatively higher NPLs to reduce this category so 
they can maintain acceptable exposure to these loans and credit portfolios. NBE will 
also closely monitor banks’ compliance with its recently issued directive on asset 
classiﬁcation and provisioning to ensure, among other things, they cease using 
collateral as a factor to determine whether a loan is non-performing or not. They must 
also take into consideration forward-looking and qualitative factors, including 
“unlikely 
pay” 
conditions 
while 
determining 
non-performing 
status, 
the 
reclassiﬁcation of loans from non-performing to performing, banks’ compliance to 
the maximum-allowed loan iterations/restructuring as provided in the directive, the 
reporting of restructured loans, the reconciliation of diferences between accounting 
and regulatory provisions, and the charging of provisions for of-balance sheet 
exposures.
B. 
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk to the banking industry remained moderate and stable during the 
review period, although exposure to sudden withdrawals by large depositors is 
high and has increased, based on a severe shock scenario assumption. The

C. 
Market and Foreign Exchange Rate Risk
Market risk is moderate but increasing. In a rising domestic interest rate 
environment, banks’ funding costs may increase since deposit liabilities are at variable 
rates, while a large amount of assets – corporate bonds held by CBE and DBE, and 
treasury bonds held by private banks – are at ﬁxed rate. As a result, banks’ 
proﬁtability may deteriorate.
The banking system has well coped with the birr’s depreciation following the foreign 
exchange regime reform of July 2024. The results of the foreign exchange stress test 
furthermore indicate that the banking industry CAR will remain above the minimum 
regulatory requirement of 8 percent under all scenarios, showing an overall high 
degree of resilience, although the systemic bank has a relatively higher degree of 
exposure.
liquidity risk is expected to increase in the short and medium terms.  The banking 
industry is expected to maintain a robust liquidity position and resilience to short-term 
liquidity shocks. However, downside risks persist, including a failure to meet weekly 
liquidity requirements, real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) payment 
requirements, asset and liability mismatches and funding gaps at the short-term 
maturity buckets, and high deposit concentrations. Although the latter are lower when 
considering deposits by the private sector only, they may suggest the need for tighter 
regulatory standards on deposit concentration risks.
As banks mobilize short-term deposits and invest same in long-term assets, they 
normally face an asset-liability time mismatch on their books. To this end, it is critical 
for banks to manage their liquidity risk and maintain adequate liquidity that will enable 
them to proactively and efectively meet their obligations at all times. Most banks in 
Ethiopia comply with NBE’s 15 percent minimum liquidity ratio requirement and have 
a proven track record of meeting payment obligations in the RTGS. NBE is closely 
monitoring banks with liquidity challenges and weaker liquidity risk management 
practices. It also engages with such banks to ensure that corrective and remedial 
actions for addressing the observed liquidity issues are implemented to prevent any 
negative spillovers to the overall ﬁnancial system. 
Going forward, NBE will take the necessary measures to ensure that banks implement 
sound and comprehensive liquidity management supported by adequate liquidity risk 
management tools. These include actively engaging in the interbank money market, 
utilizing the NBE short-term liquidity facilities, and improving their internal liquidity 
management governance, stress tests, contingency planning, and cash ﬂow 
projections.

FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT

This section focuses on the stability and vulnerability to risks of the MFI and the 
capital goods ﬁnance business sectors. Given their share of its monetary value, these 
sectors are not expected to pose a signiﬁcant risk to Ethiopia’s overall ﬁnancial 
system, but institutions have a big social impact for a number of beneﬁciaries. They 
totaled 829,078 loan clients and 5,586,302 savers at end of the review period.
At the end of June 2024, all MFIs together accounted for 1.8 percent of the ﬁnancial 
sector’s total assets, and all capital goods ﬁnance companies for 0.2 percent (see 
Table 3 in section 3.1 above). Therefore, the analysis in this section is limited, as it is 
focused on ﬁnancial stability when compared to that of the banking sector. More 
details are provided in this report’s annexes.
At the end of June 2024, 56 microﬁnance institutions 15 (with a total of 1,138 
branches) and six capital goods ﬁnance companies 16 (with a total of 56 branches) 
were operating in Ethiopia.

D. 
Operational Risk
There is signiﬁcant operational risk in the Ethiopian commercial banking 
industry, and it is expected to rise further in the short to medium term. Incidents 
of social engineering, insider threats and third-party risks are on the rise. The gross 
cost of bank fraud and forgeries increased to 1.3 billion birr from 1.0 billion birr a year 
ago. These cases occurred at 28 banks (almost every bank), mainly through the use 
of fake cash notes and cheques, embezzlement, the issuance of unauthorized bank 
guarantees, withdrawals using stolen ATM cards, and false calls or texts. 
Commercial banks are introducing new technology-based products and services that 
enhance efciency and ﬁnancial inclusion but entail signiﬁcant operational risks. 
Moreover, an increasing number of banks are applying to introduce digital micro 
credit and savings services that are provided through partnerships with third parties. 
As a consequence, incidences of fraud and embezzlement could increase. In that 
regard, policies for banks and efective strategies for measuring and mitigating 
operational risks need to put in place. In addition, this would pose an elevated cyber 
risk to the banking system more than ever before.
15  The analysis for the microﬁnance sector excludes data for the microﬁnance institutions that have been  
transformed into banks from the end of June 2019 to the end of June 2023 (Amhara Credit and Saving Institution, 
Oromia Credit and Saving Institution, Omo MFI, Somali MFI, Addis Credit and Saving Institution, and Sidama MFI).

   Microﬁnance Sector 
The microﬁnance sector’s balance sheet grew strongly and remained sound and

(from 49.4 billion birr to 60.1 billion birr) and total deposits by 29.2 percent (from 24.3 
billion birr to 31.4 billion birr), respectively. Liquid assets and net loans also increased 
by 28.4 percent and 26.9 percent, respectively, while NPLs increased much more 
moderately, at 6.3 percent (Table 9). Capital increased by 4.7 percent, and a further 
increase is anticipated because each microﬁnance institution is required to reach a 
minimum of 75 million birr within seven years.17  Also, 54 microﬁnance institutions with 
new injections of capital were under formation at the end of June 2024.

Loans remain the biggest component of total assets, accounting for 66 percent of 
them at the end of June 2024. Since the end of COVID-19, asset quality has 
signiﬁcantly improved, indicating a recovery from the pandemic period. In the year 
to the end of June 2024, the NPL ratio decreased further to 3.6 percent from 4.2 
percent a year earlier, meeting NBE’s requirement of less than 5 percent for the 
second time in ﬁve years (Figure 15).This again indicates a low risk level for the 
sector. The sector maintained strong bad debt coverage, as reﬂected by a 
provisions-to-NPLs ratio of 76.7 percent at the end of June 2024, slightly lower than 
the 80.6 percent recorded a year earlier.
The sectoral distribution of MFI loans shifed in the year to June 2024 (Figure 16): 
Loans to agriculture decreased from 21.6 percent of total microﬁnance loans in the 
year to June 2023 to 18.0 percent in the year to June 2024, whereas loans to the 
trade sector increased from 39.4 percent to 42.6 percent for the same period, 
indicating a strong shif away from rural area/agriculture loans. 
With regards to NPLs, loans to agriculture accounted for the highest share, 38.2 
percent, which may have contributed to MFIs’ decisions to shif away from 
agricultural loans (see Figure 28 in Annex B).

The MFI sector’s proﬁtability continued in an overall positive trend in the year to the 
end of June 2024: total income increased by 39.4 percent to 8.9 billion birr while 
total expenses were only recorded at 13.4 percent to 5.9 billion birr. This resulted in a 
net income of 3.0 billion birr, 148.5 percent higher than a year earlier (see Table 19 in 
Annex B). Notably, the sector registered the highest proﬁtability ratio ever for the 
measures, return on assets (RoA) and return on equity (RoE), recording 5.6 percent 
and 27.6 percent respectively at the end of June 2024 (Figure 17).
Considering individual MFIs, although some generated higher proﬁts than small 
banks or insurance companies in Ethiopia, others are still loss makers/weak 
institutions even afer several years of operation. This situation is mainly attributable to 
the absence of digitized services, which would increase efciency and reduce costs, 
and a lack of strategic leadership and weak governance practices. This may require 
policy measures aimed at consolidating the weak MFIs to create stronger institutions.

The capital goods ﬁnance business sector’s loans grew by 35.3 percent to over 3.7 
billion 18 birr in the year to June 2024, from nearly 2.8 billion birr a year earlier (Table 
10). Total assets also increased by 18.4 percent to 6.4 billion birr, but total liquid 
assets declined by 45 percent to 416 million birr. NPLs more than doubled in the year 
to the end of June 2024, also implying an increase in the NPL ratio to 7.5 percent 
for the same period, up from 5.1 percent a year earlier. This is 50 percent higher than 
the regulatory maximum of 5 percent, reﬂecting a high credit risk.

Finally, although the microﬁnance sector has met its liquidity requirements, it 
remains highly interconnected with and reliant on commercial banks: 87 percent of 
the sector’s liquid assets are held at domestic banks. The liquidity ratio remained 
relatively stable at 38.7 percent, well above NBE’s 20.0 percent minimum 
requirement (Figure 18). However, the loan-to-deposit ratio of 126.4 percent 
indicates – despite reductions for two years in a row from 134.1 percent at the end 
of June 2022 – that the sector’s ﬁnancing in addition to deposits is still heavily 
dependent on borrowing from domestic banks and international organizations, such 
as the International Fund for Agricultural Development’s Rural Financial 
Intermediation Program.

Capital goods ﬁnance companies do not accept deposits and rely on banks for a 
signiﬁcant portion of their ﬁnancing. This exposes the sector to the risk of contagion 
from adverse shocks in banking. Moreover, a lack of diversiﬁed sources for stable 
ﬁnancing and a high dependence on borrowing hinders the sector’s operational 
expansion.
The sectoral concentration of loans granted by capital goods ﬁnance companies was 
high and it increased in the year to the end of June 2024 – the share of loans to the 
manufacturing sector grew from 63.4 percent to 68 percent (Figure 19) due to the 
nature of the business. This implies a high credit concentration risk from exposure to 
the manufacturing sector.

With respect to ﬁnancial soundness, the sector is considered secure on the basis of 
capital adequacy. Although it is facing limited risk, it is increasing mainly due to 
earnings and asset quality (Figure 21). At the end of June 2024, the capital-to-risk 
weighted asset ratio was 41.9 percent, the lowest since 2020, while the 
debt-to-equity ratio reached 184.5 percent, the highest since 2020 – but still far 
below the threshold debt-to-equity ratio of 7:1, which signals that the sector is still 
signiﬁcantly below its maximum borrowing capacity.
In terms of proﬁtability, the capital goods ﬁnance sector has incurred losses in three 
out of the last ﬁve years, with the highest loss experienced during the period under 
review, mainly due to one private leasing company under liquidation proceedings. 
The return on capital and return on assets measurement stood at near zero in 
previous years, but they were clearly negative in the year to the end of June 2024, at 
-15.3 percent and -5.3 percent respectively (Figure 20). The number of leasing 
companies and their branches has remained the same over the last ﬁve years. This 
indicates there is a structural problem and a high risk for the sustainability of 
operations, which calls for corresponding policy measures to help the sector return 
to proﬁtability.

3.3.3 Summary Assessment of Risks for Financial  
 
 
 
  System Stability Emanating from the Microﬁnance  
 
  and Capital Goods Finance Sectors
Neither the microﬁnance sector nor the capital goods ﬁnance sector poses a risk to the 
Ethiopian ﬁnancial system’s stability. This is not only a result of the relatively limited size of 
these two sectors in the system, but also because they are assessed as sound overall.
The overall risk to the microﬁnance sector is considered low and stable: The capital 
adequacy, NPL, and liquidity ratios are all well within NBE’s parameters and have 
improved over the review period. There is also remarkable growth in sector-wide 
proﬁtability, although with large variances across individual MFIs, which may call for policy 
measures aimed at consolidating the sector. Close links to banking also make the 
microﬁnance sector vulnerable to potential spillovers from the sector in terms of liquidity 
and borrowing. This risk may need to be addressed through appropriate policy 
measures.The capital goods ﬁnance business sector’s risk is rated as moderate but 
increasing. This is because capital risk is assessed as low, and systemic risk is rated as 
moderate. However, earnings, asset quality, and concentration risks are rated as high, 
and may require regulatory measures to reduce the risk levels.
3.4 INSURANCE SECTOR
As of June 30th, 2024, the number of insurance companies operating in the Ethiopian 
market stood at 18, of which one is state owned.  The sector consists of 14 composite 
insurance companies transacting both long-term and general insurance businesses, and 
four general insurance companies trading only non-life/short-term insurances. The 
companies carry diferent licenses based on the main lines of insurance business they 
conduct. So far, no company has exclusively conducted a long-term business. Moreover, 
one locally incorporated reinsurance company (Ethio-Re) is operating as a local reinsurer. 
Besides, 2,894 insurance agents, 62 insurance brokers, 117 loss assessors and three 
surveyors operate in the sector. Africa-Re and PTA-Re (ZEP-RE), two overseas 
reinsurance companies with considerable presence in the sector, have local contact 
ofces in Ethiopia. The companies accept Ethiopian birr as their trading currency. In 
addition, ﬁve insurance companies are authorized to provide non-conventional, 
Sharia-compliant insurance (takaful) as “window operators19”; while one full-ﬂedged 
takaful operator (Amana Takaful) is under formation.
NBE issued a directive on motor insurance’s minimum premium rate to try and bring the 
lingering practice of premium undercutting in the industry to an end. It also has drafed 
amendments on the Requirements for Persons with Signiﬁcant Inﬂuence in an Insurer, 
Financial Reporting, and Licensing of Insurance Broker Directive. In addition, NBE carries out 
on-site inspections and of-site surveillance of insurance companies and monitors the 
implementation of supervisory concerns to strengthen the resilience of insurance companies

NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA
19 Window operators are conventional insurance service providers that also provide sharia compliant services 
through a dedicated window operation.
Stronger underwriting resulted in improved sector proﬁtability, which is considered 
sound. Insurers generated a net income before tax of 6.5 billion birr and 0.4 billion 
birr from the general and long-term insurance businesses, respectively. This 
corresponds to a return on equity of 31.5 percent for general and 21.9 percent for 
long-term classes of business. However, inﬂation led to losses on insurers’ ﬁxed 
income holdings of bank deposits. The ﬁve-year average return on investment in the 
general insurance class of business was 9.6 percent. 
The insurance sector registered a record gross premium of 28.7 billion birr at the end 
of June 2024, 23.7 percent higher than a year earlier and above the inﬂation rate of 
19.9 percent. The general class of business accounted for 92.0 percent (26.4 billion 
birr) of the sector’s gross written premium, while the long-term business and takaful

3.4.1  Performace of the Sector
The total assets of the sector stood at 65.6 billion birr at end of June 2024, up 32.0 
percent from the previous year (Table 12). The general insurance business accounted for 
93.2 percent of the sector’s total assets during the period under review. Sector assets 
were ofset by liabilities of 43.2 billion birr, up 29.3 percent from the previous year (33.4 
billion birr). This resulted in net assets of 22.4 billion birr, up 37.4 percent from the 
previous year (16.3 billion birr).
The 32 percent growth of total assets was ﬁnanced by an increase in liabilities (by 9.8 
billion birr, or 61.6 percent of the total asset increase) and equity (by 6.1 billion birr, or 38.4 
percent of the total asset increase). The increase in capital is mainly attributable to 
operational results, which are partly due to an increase in paid-up capital. This is 
attributable to NBE’s directive that requires insurers to increase their paid-up capital to 
0.4 billion birr by the end of June 2027.

insurance accounted for the remaining 8.0 percent (Figure 29 in Annex D). In terms of 
products, 54.7 percent of the general insurance business is motor related, and 87.7 
percent of the long-term business is term and permanent health insurance, which are 
technically short-term policies of one year. 
Net earned premium and net claims incurred for the general class of business was 16.9 
billion birr and 8.6 billion birr respectively at the end of June 2024. The respective 
growth of the net earned premium and net claims incurred was 44.5 percent and 26 
percent. Underwriting expense for the general business was 5 billion birr, a 30.7 
percent increase from the previous period of 3.7 billion birr. The resulting claims ratio 
and expense ratios were 50.9 percent and 29.6 percent, respectively (Figure 22). The 
performance of the general insurance business, as measured by the combined ratio of 
the loss and expense ratios, stood at 80.5 percent at the end of June 2024, better than 
the 91 percent recorded in the previous year and the best in ﬁve years. The minimum 
motor insurance premium rate that was issued by NBE in August 2023 might have 
partly contributed to the improved performance in this regard.

The sector solvency, equity to liability, and liquidity positions have improved in 2024 
(Figure 23). Equity as a percentage of liability stood at 63.2 percent, which is well 
above the 20 percent minimum prudential requirement. The industry maintained a 
solvency ratio (statutory capital compared to required capital) of 316 percent, showing 
a 73 percentage-point increment from the last reporting period. In addition, the sector 
is liquid with a liquidity ratio – this measures the percentage of an insurers’ liability 
against the available liquid assets – that stood at 92.6 percent in June 2024. This was 
a marginal improvement over last year’s result of 94.6 percent. 20 There were no 
signiﬁcant changes in the investment portfolio composition. Even though general 
insurers are required to invest a minimum of 60 percent of their total assets in liquid 
assets, mainly in bank deposits and government securities, the actual result in this 
regard is 48 percent, which signiﬁes a material shortfall.

20 Liquidity is measured as current liability divided by current assets. The maximum standard is 105 percent. The 
lower the ratio, the lower the liquidity risk. A decreasing ratio is therefore an indication of a decreasing liquidity risk.
Operational Risk: A lack of technical expertise in insurance is a real constraint. Most 
insurance companies’ operations remain underdeveloped and unautomated. There 
are hurdles to overcome to implement IFRS 1721  due to the unavailability of data and 
a lower level of automation for the industry’s core business. The implications of this 
will be seen in the ﬁnancial reporting period for the year to the end of June 2024.
Insurance Risk: This refers to the risk that inadequate or inappropriate underwriting, 
product design, pricing and claims settlement expose an insurer to ﬁnancial losses 
and a consequent inability to meet its liabilities. Ethiopia’s insurance sector is known 
for its stif price competition in all classes of business. Insufcient premiums could 
leave industry players unable to meet their obligations from claims.
Concentration Risk: The government-owned insurance corporation accounts for 32 
percent of the market share. In addition, Ethiopian Reinsurance Company receives 25 
percent of treaty cession and 5 percent of each policy insurers underwrite. Moreover, 
55 percent of the general class of business is motor insurance, which needs to be 
diversiﬁed going forward.

The main risks faced by the insurance sector are due to changes in macroeconomic 
policies and risks related to insurance, operations, markets, and the sector’s 
concentration of players. Pressing concerns are market penetration, speciﬁcally in 
the life class of the business; a shortage of insurance professionals, such as 
actuaries; and inadequate IT infrastructure in the industry and regulatory body.

21 IFRS 17 is the newest IFRS standard for insurance contracts and replaced IFRS 4 on January 1st, 2022. It states 
which insurance contracts items should by on the balance and the proﬁt and loss account of an insurance 
company, how to measure these items, and how to present and disclose this information.
 22 Cooperative societies in Ethiopia are established and administered in accordance with Proclamation No. 985/2016.

Market Risk: The investment portfolio of insurers is restricted to bank deposits by 
law. Such provisions could inhibit insurers from earning higher returns that could 
enable the further development of the sector. 
Despite the potential ﬁnancial stability headwinds, the sector outlook remains 
positive in terms of growth, stability and resilience. Technology development and 
automation are necessary to tackle operational risks. The sector also needs to build 
its capacity to expand the pool of insurance professionals. Furthermore, focus 
should also be given to the implementation of risk-based capital and IFRS 17.
3.5 HIGHLIGHTS ON SAVINGS AND CREDIT  
 
       COOPERATIVES AND PENSION FUNDS
Savings and Credit Cooperatives
Ethiopia has a large network of savings and credit cooperatives (SACCOs)22  – over 
21,000 in total – which play an important role in ﬁnancial inclusion, especially in the 
underserved rural areas. Nevertheless, SACCOs have limited capacity to increase 
their market share and become truly competitive ﬁnancial institutions due to 
limitations in size, skills, products, use of technology, and operational models. From 
the point of view of the ﬁnancial system’s stability, SACCOs pose no systemic risk due 
to the limited size of the sector.
Pension Funds
Pension funds in Ethiopia are administered by two agencies, the Public Employees 
Social Security Administration Agency as per provisions of Proclamation 
No.1267/2022, and the Private Organization Employees Social Security Fund 
Administration Agency as per provisions of Proclamation No. 1268/2022.

DEVELOPMENT AND RISKS
Payment systems in Ethiopia were radically modernized in 2011 afer NBE launched 
the Ethiopian Automated Transfer System (EATS), an interbank payment system 
comprising both the real time gross settlement (RTGS) system 23 and the automated 
clearing house (ACH). 24  NBE owns and manages the EATS, which provides facilities 
for the ﬁnal settlement of payments between ﬁnancial institutions and clearing and 
netting services for bulk payments. Before 2011, all payments in the country, including 
bank-to-bank transfers, were made through the exchange of letters; as a result, a 
single interbank transfer took days to settle.
The ﬁnancial sector’s dependency on the RTGS infrastructure has increased over 
time, and the EATS is the only ﬁnancial market infrastructure designated as a 
systematically important payment system in Ethiopia. To ensure its safety, efciency, 
and reliability, NBE has established a robust regulatory framework. (Box 5) Due to 
efective oversight and administration, the EATS operated at 99.9 percent reliability 
during the year to June 2024.
This chapter discusses developments and risks for the stability of Ethiopia’s ﬁnancial 
system related to its infrastructure. The infrastructure comprises currency 
management, the payment and settlement system, credit market infrastructure, and 
ﬁnancial inclusion and consumer protection.
Box 5: 
Payment System Regulatory Framework and Developments
The digital payments ecosystem has seen signiﬁcant growth over the last few years. 
As of June 2024, there are over 198 million digital accounts, including more than 110 
million mobile money accounts and 47 million mobile banking accounts. Additionally, 
more than 35 million debit cards are in circulation. These advancements are 
promoting ﬁnancial inclusion for many Ethiopians. On average, the digital payments 
ecosystem processes over 7.5 million transactions daily, with a total transaction value 
exceeding 26.5 billion birr. These ﬁgures highlight the country’s increasing reliance on 
digital platforms and the impact of technology on its ﬁnancial landscape.
23  The RTGS is an electronic form of funds transfer for high value or sensitive payments, where money transfer takes 
places from one participant to another in real-time and on an individual basis. All participants maintain a payment and 
settlement account in RTGS for ﬁnal settlement of the transactions between them.
24  ACH is a system where low value large volume transactions (bulk transactions) are cleared and a net settlement 
instruction is produced. It is an electronic clearing house for cheque, Credit Transfer (CT) and Direct Debit (DD) 
instruments. In ACH, settlement does not happen; rather, it produces net settlement instructions and sends them to 
RTGS for ﬁnal settlement. Each instrument, which is cleared in the ACH, requires a separate rule and arrangement.

4.1.1.1. Ethiopian Automated Transfer System
At the end of June 2024, 35 ﬁnancial institutions participated in EATS, of which three 
were MFIs. No major EATS interruption was reported in the year under review. The 
system processed more than 3.5 million transactions (down by 8.5 percent from the 
previous year) with a value of more than 4 trillion birr (an annual decrease of 17 
percent). The decline in both volume and value of RTGS transactions is mainly due to 
the rise of other interoperable digital payment channels, such as mobile banking.

In the coming years, the country's digital payments landscape is expected to undergo 
a signiﬁcant transformation, and further enhancing the growth and accessibility of this 
type of technology. The shif will position the payments infrastructure as a key enabler 
of ﬁnancial inclusion and economic growth. Several strategic initiatives are driving this 
progress. They include:
• Building secure and efcient digital public infrastructure. By integrating the 
instant payments infrastructure that is currently implemented by the national 
switch, with the national ID system (Fayda), NBE aims to create a more secure, 
efcient, inclusive, and interoperable digital payments landscape that promotes 
ﬁnancial inclusion and economic development.
• Expanding the instant payments system’s services. These services will allow con-
sumers to conduct transactions in real-time, which is essential for fostering a 
dynamic economy.
• Creating a more enabling regulatory framework. This framework will ensure the 
digital payments industry operates smoothly, securely, and in compliance with 
regulations. Learning from the implementation of the National Digital Payment 
Strategy (NDPS) 1.0, the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) is set to launch NDPS 
2.0 in early 2025. This new strategy aims to establish a robust digital payments 
ecosystem that provides a strong foundation for the country’s ﬁnancial system 
and economic growth.
The newly introduced QR code standard for digital payments in Ethiopia is also set to 
simplify transaction processes for merchants across the country. This standard will 
enhance security and make payments more straightforward for customers and mer-
chants, thereby expanding access to digital payments platforms for both retail and 
wholesale merchants. 
The swif advance of digital payments systems in Ethiopia, complemented by strategic 
initiatives proposed by NBE, will signiﬁcantly improve access to diverse ﬁnancial 
services for the population. The expansion of a secure and interoperable digital 
payments ecosystem not only provides individuals and businesses with a greater 
range of options for making payments, but it also fosters ﬁnancial inclusion, economic 
growth, and a growing conﬁdence among the public.

end of June 2024 over the previous year. The number of PoS terminals deployed 
within ﬁnancial institutions and at merchant locations also increased by 16.7 percent 
to 14,030 at the end of June 2024 from a year earlier. This is due to the 
commercialization of some non-bank PoS operators during the year. The number of

Following a recent NBE directive, domestic and foreign non-bank payment service 
providers are allowed to issue electronic money instruments and/or obtain a payment 
system operator’s license to provide payment and remittance services.
As of June 30th, 2024, 11 non-bank entities were licensed under the new regulatory 
framework. This includes one national switch, six licensed payment systems 
operators, and four licensed payment instrument issuers. Table 13 shows the 
development of digital ﬁnancial services’ (DFS) access points since 2020.

PoS devices at merchant locations is expected to increase further in the coming years 
as many non-bank payment service providers enter the market.
The number of debit cards in circulation rose by 18.5 percent to 45.5 million by the 
end of June 2024 from the previous year.
Mobile banking is the most widely used digital payment channel in Ethiopia. This is 
due to the services provided by many commercial banks, with 18 banks currently 
ofering mobile banking at diferent scales. Consequently, the number of registered 
accounts increased by 45 percent to 39.6 million by the end in June 2024 from a 
year earlier. The number of mobile money/wallet users also increased by 56.6 
percent from June 2023 to 107.5 million by the end of June 2024. The rapid growth 
was largely attributed to the expansion of Telebirr mobile money services and the 
operationalization of M-Pesa by Safaricom Ethiopia PLC and Kacha Digital Financial 
Services S.C.
Internet banking in Ethiopia is still in its infancy relatively speaking, with 12.2 million 
users by the end of June 2024, but it is growing rapidly. The number of mobile 
money agents increased by 78.1 percent at the end of June 2024 compared to the 
previous year, reaching 415,084 agents. The increase is mainly attributed to the 
expansion of Telebirr in the market.
Digital payments are growing at an exponential rate (Table 14). In the year to June 
30th, 2024, payments worth more than 9.6 trillion birr were processed digitally, an 
increase of more than 50 percent compared to the previous year. This growth is the 
result of the successful implementation of the National Digital Payment Strategy and 
NBE’s reform activities.

4.1.2  Interoperability
Interoperability is key to a stable, successful, and inclusive digital payments 
ecosystem. The vast majority of countries worldwide have recognized the importance 
of a local switch that enables interoperability and has optimal infrastructure for banks 
to connect to and allows real-time payments 24/7.
Through its national switch, Ethswitch, Ethiopia has successfully implemented a 
comprehensive digital payments framework, achieving full-scale interoperability for 
various payment methods, including person-to-person (P2P) payments, ATM cash 
withdrawals, PoS transactions, and the use of quick response (QR) codes for seamless 
ﬁnancial exchanges. As a result, the number and value of transactions have grown 
exponentially (Table 15).
Table 15: Interoperability Performance Through ATM, Point of Sale and Person-to-Person Transactions,
 
 
 2020-2024
The smooth and efcient functioning of the national switch is vital for the growth of 
the digital payment landscape in the country. Recognizing this importance, NBE has 
provided extensive support to enhance the capabilities of the national switch. This 
support is not only aimed at ensuring that the system operates at its maximum 
capacity, it also focuses on developing the necessary infrastructure to facilitate the 
widespread adoption and integration of digital payments solutions throughout 
Ethiopia.

Payment systems risk includes potential losses to entities or individuals, such as a 
bank’s customers or third parties, that send or receive payments. Accordingly, it is 
important for a bank’s risk management practices and internal controls to evolve and 
keep up with changes in the bank’s payment systems, products, and services. Like 
any other system globally, developments in the country’s payment system are 
exposed to several risks, including operational, liquidity, compliance, reputation, 
systemic, fraud, and settlement.

FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT
NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA
Liquidity risk refers to the potential for participants to lack sufcient funds to meet 
their settlement obligations. This leads to disruptions in the smooth functioning of the 
system and settlement failure, which reduces the efciency and reliability of the 
payment system, afecting peer participants and their clients. Short-term liquidity 
problems were seen on the system by a few participants during the period. The 
recently established Standing Lending Facility should serve as a safety net for 
participants during times of unexpected liquidity shortages in the period ahead.
Compliance risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences arising from a 
failure to comply with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards, leading to 
increased exposure to other risks such as operational, credit, and liquidity risks. No 
major failures to comply with NBE regulatory requirements were seen from the 
payment service providers during the period, as NBE has established robust 
regulatory frameworks to reduce the likelihood of non-compliance, and it maintains a 
strong reputation for adherence to legal and regulatory standards.
Reputation Risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences arising from the 
public’s negative perception of, or damage to, the payment system's reputation. This 
can occur when a payment system fails to perform as expected, leading to loss of trust 
among participants, the public and customers. In the review period no issues were 
seen on the system that led to a loss of trust among its participants and customers. 
Regular monitoring and oversight of the payments system can mitigate the potential 
risks.
Settlement Risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences arising from the 
failure of one party to fulﬁll its settlement obligations, leading to ﬁnancial losses or 
disruptions in the settlement process. Continuous monitoring of the system, prudent 
liquidity management, establishing collateral requirements for participants with 
intraday credit exposure, and ensuring the ﬁnality and irrevocability of settlement can 
enhance the resilience of its processes, reduce the likelihood of settlement risk, and 
contribute to the system’s overall stability and reliability. 
Systemic Risk refers to the potential for widespread disruptions across the ﬁnancial 
system that can occur due to the failure of a major payments system participant or a 
systemic failure in the payments’ infrastructure. Such disruptions can have cascading 
efects, impact on multiple participants and undermine the system’s overall ﬁnancial 
stability. To mitigate systemic risks, it is crucial to implement a variety of measures. 
These include enhanced monitoring and stress testing of the payments system, and 
the establishment of strong contingency plans and robust coordination among 
regulatory authorities, ﬁnancial institutions, and payment system operators.
Fraud Risk involves the potential for fraudulent activities that can compromise the 
integrity of payment systems and lead to ﬁnancial losses for participants. Fraudulent 
activities can include unauthorized transactions, identity thef, and the manipulation of 
4.2 CREDIT MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE
payment data. Efective fraud risk management requires the implementation of 
advanced fraud detection systems, regular monitoring for suspicious activities, and 
strong authentication protocols. Additionally, educating users about security best 
practices and ensuring compliance with industry standards can further reduce the risk 
of fraud within the payments system.
Cyber Security Risk: Globally, attacks on information and communications 
technology systems (cyber-attacks) are increasing, targeting mostly the ﬁnancial 
sector. It poses signiﬁcant threats to the integrity, conﬁdentiality, and availability of 
ﬁnancial transactions, leading to data breaches, the disruptions of services, fraudulent 
transactions and reputational damage. No cyber security threats were reported to 
NBE from participants of EATS and DFS providers during the period. Strong security 
controls (like multifactor authentication), vendor security assessments, establishing 
redundant and backup systems to improve reliability, and collaboration with law 
enforcement bodies can enhance its cyber security posture and better protect against 
potential threats.
Overall, the national payments system is expected to remain safe, efcient, and 
trusted among users in 2025. The performance of EATS and DFS products is 
expected to show continuous growth both in value and volume terms, and they will 
continue to evolve and contribute to the country’s overall ﬁnancial stability. 
Ethiopia’s Credit Reference Bureau (initially called the Credit Information Centre) was 
ﬁrst established in 2004. Its main purpose was to lessen the difculty of getting 
adequate and timely credit information that enables the satisfactory assessment of 
banking sector borrowers’ credit worthiness. This will improve the loan portfolio and 
the stability of the ﬁnancial system. 
Initially, credit information was manually made available to lending banks, which were 
mandated to grant loans and advances of 200,000 birr or more, only afer ﬁrst 
obtaining information from the Credit Information Centre. The system was upgraded 
and expanded in 2012 and again in 2019, incorporating MFIs and capital goods 
ﬁnancing companies as subscribers, data providers, and users.
In summary, the expansion in the credit reporting system’s (CRS) coverage has 
contributed substantially to ensuring an adequate loan portfolio in the banking and 
MFI industries. Going forward, the modernization of the CRS – including the upgrade 
of IT infrastructure, the modernization and streamlining of databases, and updating 
the service-level agreements – will ensure that CRS’s operational risk remains stable.

Financial inclusion is an essential prerequisite for sustainable development, and it 
plays a key role in stabilizing the country’s ﬁnancial system, job creation, digital 
transformation, and Ethiopia’s continued economic growth. It allows ﬁnancial 
institutions to access diversiﬁed funding sources and improve their ability to manage 
their liquidity risks. Expanding ﬁnancial access and use in severely underserved areas 
is a national priority and NBE’s long-standing target. In response to these policy 
objectives, the National Financial Inclusion Strategy II was developed and is now in 
the process of being implemented. In support of this, a comprehensive regional 
ﬁnancial inclusion framework has been developed and launched during the year for 
nine regional states. The framework is mainly prepared to aggressively expand 
ﬁnancial access to underserved areas, narrow the regional ﬁnancial inclusion disparity 
and accommodate the regional context. 
Over the past ﬁve years, the number of transaction accounts 25 has increased at an 
average annual rate of 31 percent, reaching 272 million at the end of June 2024. Of 
these, the total number of interest-free deposit accounts accounted for 23.7 million. 
Accordingly, the number of transaction accounts per 100 adults reached 477 at the 
end of June 2024, compared to 365 a year before and the National Finance Inclusion 
Strategy II’s (NFIS-II) headline target of 286 (Figure 24). The number of traditional and 
digital ﬁnancial access points has expanded signiﬁcantly. Their combined number 
increased by 64.4 percent from 271,203 at the end of June 2023 to 445,856 a year 
later. In terms of access points per capita, 782 ﬁnancial access points served 
100,000 adults during 2024, compared with 493 access points per 100,000 adults 
in 2023.

Furthermore, the total number of credit accounts in the ﬁnancial sector increased 
from 6.4 million at the end of June 2023 to 10.5 million at the end of June 2024 – 
a growth rate of 64.3 percent (Figure 25). During the year, there were a total of 4.1 
million new digital credit users. As a result, the total number of credit accounts per 
100 adults increased to over 18 at the end of June 2024 against 11.6 at the end of 
June 2023 and far above the NFIS-II’s headline target of 12.8.
Financial consumer protection is another important intervention area for NBE, which 
aims to enhance the trust and conﬁdence of the general public by ensuring 
transparency, fairness, and consumer rights. Accordingly, NBE issued the relevant 
Financial Consumer Protection Directive and established a directorate dedicated to 
the supervision of the market, dispute resolution, and ensuring ﬁnancial consumer 
rights are fully protected, and market conﬁdence is maintained. During the year, a 
total of 3,345 ﬁnancial consumer complaints related to transaction failure, 
unauthorized transactions, data misuse, and fraud were received by ﬁnancial 
institutions. Of these, 48 percent are related to transaction failures. The ﬁnancial 
institutions resolved 90 percent of the complaints reported during the year.
