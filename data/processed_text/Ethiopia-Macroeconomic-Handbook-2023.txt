The Ethiopian economy stands at a critical juncture at the start of 2023, following two 
years of conflict that brought immense humanitarian, social, and material losses.            
In the face of major economic challenges, whether macro policies in the coming year 
take a mostly ‘status quo approach’ or instead follow a series of ‘breakthrough 
policies’ is a key unknown for the period ahead. To assess which of these divergent 
paths may lie ahead, we first take stock of Ethiopia’s latest macroeconomic indicators 
and conditions. We then lay out two potential macro scenarios involving either 
‘status quo policies’ or ‘breakthrough policies’ and chart out how each scenario could 
unfold alongside the attendant implications for growth, inflation, budgets, banking, 
and foreign exchange conditions in the two cases. Reflecting some recent policy 
signals, changes in central bank leadership, and an admittedly optimistic bias, we 
think that a ‘breakthrough year’ (involving a reversal of emergency conflict-related 
macro measures, a revival of reforms, and a re-engagement with external partners) 
is more likely than the alternative, and offer accordingly our projections for the real, 
fiscal, monetary, and external sectors under this presumed scenario.   
 
Macroeconomic Conditions at the Start of 2023: An Overview after Two Years of Conflict 
 
 
1. Growth: A slowdown overall but understandable given global and conflict conditions 
 
2. Investment: Down sharply from 35% to 25% of GDP due to cutbacks in both the public and private sectors 
 
3. Inflation:  Still high, broad-based, and persistent—with policy sources arguably now more significant 
 
4. Deficits and debt: Both under control for now, but there is a growing dependence on domestic lenders 
 
5. Monetary policy: Helping to cover the budget deficit but at a cost of crowding out private credit 
 
6. Banking sector: Another year of strong performance, but mostly in nominal not in real terms 
 
7. Balance of payments and foreign exchange: A $2bn deficit has sharply reduced foreign exchange reserves 
 
 
Macro Prospects and Outlook: Two divergent paths possible 
 
 
8. A thematic overview and implications for the outlook: A macro stocktaking suggests four key priorities

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Recent developments 
 
1. Growth: A slowdown overall but understandable given global and conflict conditions  
 
§ 
Three years of 6 percent growth: GDP growth for the fiscal year ending in June 2022 ended up at 6.4 percent 
per Government statistics, nearly identical to the two prior year figures of 6.1% and 6.3%, but a drop from the 
previous five-year average of 9 percent. Growth was strongest in services (up 7.6% reflecting expansion in 
government spending and a post-COVID recovery in transport, hotels, and tourism), followed by agriculture, 
where favourable rains in most food-growing regions and multiple initiatives to expand hectares cultivated for 
wheat and other grains appear to have driven the reported 6.1% expansion. Growth was slowest in industry, 
reflecting bottlenecks in the dominant construction sector, which grew by only 5 percent (versus past growth 
rates of above 20%) due to dysfunctional markets for cement and other inputs; the manufacturing sub-sector 
saw similarly minimal growth on account of forex constraints and ease-of-doing-business related challenges.  
 
§ 
Non-GDP indicators of economic activity broadly mirror the GDP statistics: For 2021-22, high-frequency data 
showed strong growth in the trade and service sectors (exports, tourism, remittances and telecom activity) but 
mostly negative trends for industry sector proxies such as electricity production and capital goods imports. 
 
§ 
Latest six months data show strength in services and agriculture, but weakness in exports and industry: 
Looking at the July to December 2022 period, for which GDP data is not available, signs of weakness are most 
notable in exports (down 7 percent after three years of positive growth), in industrial park output (-26%), and in 
cement production (-23%). Growth is still being registered in many service sector indicators and this also appears 
to be the case in the dominant agricultural sector (based on reported hectares under cultivation, on-going wheat 
farming initiatives, and data on fertilizer import volumes). 
 
2.  Investment: Down sharply from 35% to 25% of GDP due to cutbacks in both the public and private sectors 
 
§ 
Large drop in investment rate: New investment spending has fallen sharply to 25% of GDP in FY 2022 from 28% 
the prior year, 35% as recently as three years ago, and a past ten-year average of 35% of GDP. 
§ 
Public investment has dropped more than private investment: The Government’s capital spending budget has 
shrunk from 6% to 2% of GDP in recent years due to conflict-related and other spending priorities, while 
investment by state enterprises has also fallen as their scope for borrowing (especially of non-concessional debt) 
has been cut back due to deliberate policies to limit overall debt accumulation. Taken together, we estimate 
that public sector investment outlays more than halved from near 10% to 4% of GDP. Private foreign investment 
as well as private domestic investment declined moderately (relative to GDP) or remained broadly unchanged. 
 
§ 
If not reversed, lower investment rates will soon bring lower growth rates: Ethiopia’s record growth rates of 
8%-10% growth in the five years to 2019 coincided with average investment rates of near 36% of GDP; a drop in 
investment rates towards the mid-20s or below (in percent of GDP) would imply long-term growth remaining at 
rates of just 5-6 percent assuming similar capital formation-to-output ratios from recent norms.  
 
3. Inflation: Still high, broad-based, and persistent—with policy sources arguably now more significant 
 
§ 
A key macro challenge: Ethiopia’s inflation rate averaged 34% during 2022, having previously averaged an 
already high 27% throughout 2021. The latest reading for December 2022 shows year-on-year inflation at 33.8% 
(a slight improvement from the May 2022 peak of 37.2%), while month-on-month price increases—which better 
capture latest trends—are also moving in a positive direction, averaging just 1.1% in Q4 of 2022 versus 3.1% and 
2.8% in Q2 and Q3 respectively. The average monthly price increase seen in the final quarter of 2022 is now 
equivalent to just 14% when expressed at an annualized rate, implying a positive outlook if the recent trend 
were to continue.  However, such drops in (month-on-month) inflation have often turned out to be short-lived 
over the past two years and it is not clear yet if there is a decisive downward shift in inflation rates.

§ 
Food inflation is moderating, non-food inflation is worsening: Non-food prices (up 35% y-o-y) are becoming 
dominant contributors to overall inflation, with large price jumps seen for fuel, transport, alcoholic beverages, 
furnishings, and housing. By contrast, food inflation has declined by 10 percentage points since early 2022 (33% 
now vs 44% then) and showed negative month-on-month inflation rates for two of the past three months 
following the recent kiremt harvests. Food prices are yet to show any level declines, however, despite the fact 
that global food price measures (such as the FAO food price index) are now around 20% below their 2022 peaks.  
   
§ 
Services inflation vs imported inflation: Domestically offered services are showing lower inflation rates (of near 
27%), presumably reflecting more elastic local supplies and competitive conditions in this space. By contrast, 
mostly imported commodities are showing 50% y-o-y inflation, which is similar to the percentage change in the 
parallel exchange rate (and suggests many consumer goods are actually being secured in that market).  
 
§ 
Policy sources of inflation: Administrative measures such as recent fuel price increases, excise/tariff 
adjustments, and import bans on selected consumer goods appear to be having a greater role in recent monthly 
inflation, and likely explain why non-food inflation has now exceeded food inflation over the past three months. 
Fiscal and monetary policies, already quite expansionary for most of FY 2021-22, have become even more so 
over the last six months (judging by M2 growth and use of central bank advances—see below) and inflation is 
thus unlikely to decline meaningfully unless this loose policy stance is restrained somewhat in the period ahead.  
 
4. Deficits and Debt: Both under control for now, but there is a growing dependence on domestic lenders 
 
§ 
Deficits have widened but not dramatically so: At close to 4 percent of GDP for both the current and last fiscal 
years, budget deficits have risen slightly from previous norms of near 3% of GDP. Still, the fact that the deficits 
were not even higher—despite COVID, global shocks, and conflict—is a positive sign of fiscal control.   
 
§ 
Debt ratios are falling and debt composition changing: As of September 2022, public debt stood at $57bn (45% 
of FY 22 GDP) with the external component at just $27bn or 21% of FY22 GDP. Domestic debt now makes up 
over half of total public debt, reflecting recent drops in external borrowing and the shift to domestic lenders.  
 
§ 
Debt servicing remains a burden, though mostly on external debt: Annual external debt service payments of 
$2.1bn were paid in the last fiscal year, and such dues continued to be paid till end-2022. Most of this $2.1bn in 
annual foreign loan repayments reflect state enterprise debt, and are thus not obligations covered by budgetary 
outlays, but their fx needs still means a large drain on fx reserves. The lack of progress in the IMF/G-20 ‘Common 
Framework’ initiative has meant there has been no relief yet on any of these external debt service obligations. 
 
§ 
Latest fiscal trends: Revenue collections are up strongly so far this fiscal year, with Birr 226bn in collections in 
the six months to December 2022, or an increase of 32% from the same period last year. This performance is 
only just managing to keep up with inflation, however, and together with high spending plans (of Birr 787bn) 
and low chances of much grants and loans for the current fiscal year, the deficit is likely to reach close to the 
Birr 300bn anticipated in the budget (~4% of GDP and virtually all of which is to be financed domestically).  
 
5. Monetary policy: Helping to cover the budget deficit but at a cost of crowding out private credit 
 
§ 
Fiscal deficit is driving monetary policy: Given large deficit financing needs, around two-thirds of net new credit 
provided by the financial system in 2021-22 was directed to the public sector last fiscal year (Birr 290bn of Birr 
449bn), of which net new credit to the government alone was Birr 208bn (3.4% of GDP); the most recent quarter 
(ending Sep 2022) for which data is available shows 70% of new credit is being absorbed by the public sector.  
 
§ 
A spike in central bank lending to Government: A large share of credit flowing to the government is now coming 
from direct central bank advances (which contributes directly to money creation) rather than from local lenders 
such as commercial banks and pension funds. Central bank advances now make up a quarter of the 
Government’s outstanding domestic debt stock (Birr 220bn out of Birr 926bn) as of September 2022 though this 
source of financing had almost been eliminated just two years ago (then only Birr 31bn or 7% of the domestic 
debt stock).

§ 
Crowding out of the private sector: Growth in credit to the private sector was only 23 percent y-o-y in 
September 2022, per our estimates, or below the rate of inflation and a decline relative to GDP. 
 
6. Banking: Another year of strong performance, but mostly in nominal not in real terms 
 
§ 
Strong headline numbers: Banks showed 25% growth in deposits, 30% growth in loans, and 43% growth in 
profits for FY 2021-22. Data for end-2022 show even stronger growth rates so far this fiscal year.  
 
§ 
Lending spreads of 9 percent and high fx fees continue to propel profits: Profits rose from Birr40bn to Birr57bn 
at all banks (and from Birr 20bn to 30bn at private banks). The combined profit pool is now $1.2bn in USD terms. 
 
§ 
EPS returns have turned negative in real terms: Average earnings per share were 31 percent at private banks 
last year, exactly in line with the prior five-year average. However, once accounting for inflation, real EPS returns 
have fallen to -2%, or the first such negative real return since the start of private banking.  
 
§ 
Disruption ahead: The sector continues to be in the midst of a rapidly changing market environment marked by 
a shifting regulatory framework (with periodic changes to policies governing cash transactions, fx surrender 
rules, credit allocations), large numbers of new banks, new types of service providers, and the very near-term 
prospect of intensifying competition from fintech firms, telecom companies, foreign banks, and capital markets. 
 
7. BOP and foreign exchange position:  A $2bn deficit has sharply reduced foreign exchange reserves 
 
§ 
A large BOP deficit has reduced reserves: Despite pockets of good performance seen within the BOP last year 
(for exports, service income, and FDI), a $4bn jump in imports plus a drop in grants and loans contributed to a 
$2bn BOP deficit in FY 2021-22. This deficit was covered by drawing down $1.4bn of central bank reserves and 
another $0.5bn of commercial banks’ reserves. Following these drawdowns, fx reserves at the central bank 
stood at $1.5bn as of June 2022 (latest reported period) while fx assets at commercial banks were $1.2 bn.  
 
 
§ 
Latest BOP trends: The BOP continued to be under pressure in the last six months of 2022. While import growth 
has slowed sharply in recent months (to just 8% y-o-y growth), export growth has turned negative, grants and 
loans remain low, and debt service remains a major drain on fx reserves. Accordingly, we estimate fx reserves 
have fallen slightly over the last six months and are likely in the range of $1.2bn to $1.5bn as of end-2022. 
 
 
§ 
Stable official rate but falling parallel rate: The large BOP deficit and related tightening of fx supplies has 
resulted in a sharp fall in the parallel market rate, which stood at close to 100 Birr/USD at end-2022 versus an 
official rate of near 53 Birr/USD. Over the course of 2022, the Birr depreciated by only 8% year-on-year in the 
official market (from 49.2 to 53.3) but fell by 50% (from 64 to 96) in the parallel market. The spread between 
these two rates is now at its highest in years and a major indication of an unrealistic official exchange rate.  
 
 
Future Prospects and Outlook 
 
8. A Thematic Overview and Implications for the Outlook: A macro stocktaking suggests to four key priorities  
 
§ 
Stocktaking after two years of conflict: A stocktaking of the recent policy record shows that, despite pockets of 
continued reform, macro policies have moved backwards in multiple areas due to emergency conflict-related 
measures. On macro outturns, the overall scorecard has been a mix of ‘the good, the bad, and the unknown’—
with severe setbacks clearly seen in many areas (inflation, investment, industry, foreign financing, fx reserves) 
but also signs of resilience in some economic sub-segments (agriculture, service exports, tourism, banking).    
 
§ 
Priorities Ahead: Considering current economic conditions and judging from the messages coming out since the 
end of the conflict, the primary focus areas of policymakers for the year ahead are bound to be on: (1) large 
reconstruction spending; (2) reviving growth and investment; (3) reducing inflation and (4) resolving foreign 
exchange constraints and distortions.

5 
§ 
Policy paths: Given the priorities above, a key question is whether policymakers will adopt a largely ‘status quo’ 
approach or instead follow a series of ‘breakthrough policies’ for the year ahead.  In our judgement, the former 
approach risks providing only a partial and temporary relief to macroeconomic pressures, while the latter 
approach promises to more comprehensively address the many daunting challenges ahead.  
 
9. A ‘status quo policies’ scenario: Such a prospect cannot be ruled out but is not our central expectation. 
 
§ 
A ‘status quo’ set of policies: The prospect of a ‘status quo’ approach cannot be ruled out given many internal 
and external circumstances that could constrain policy choices and execution in the period ahead. In particular, 
a lack of further progress on the domestic political, security, or governance front and/or geo-political factors 
could all hold back government’s ability to plan, execute, and deliver as intended on its policy reform agenda.  
 
§ 
‘Muddling-through’: With a largely ‘status quo approach’ it is likely there will be limited reversals of emergency 
macro measures, limited structural/sector reforms, and limited re-engagement with external partners. Under 
this state of affairs, the probabilities are high that investment remains at its subdued levels, that the industrial 
sector continues to face many stresses (fx, credit, ease of doing business constraints), that foreign investment 
eventually wanes, and that funds for reconstruction and rebuilding fall far short of expectations. Macro outturns 
can only be expected to reflect these weak supportive conditions and would thus exhibit reduced growth, high 
inflation, persistently large fiscal/BOP deficits, and ultimately a ‘vicious cycle’ of poor performance.  
 
10. A ‘breakthrough policies’ scenario: This seems more likely than the alternative, and guides our 2023-24 forecasts  
 
§ 
Possibly a distinct break from past policies: In our view, current economic conditions provide strong grounds 
for embarking on a set of ‘breakthrough’ policies this year, especially as policymakers re-focus policy attention 
towards the economy and considering the need to ensure reconstruction funding, increase overall investment, 
reduce inflation, and boost fx resources.  Upcoming revisions in the Homegrown Economic Reform Plan, 
statements of intention to resume an IMF program for macro policy support, and new leadership at the central 
bank all suggest that a move towards such ‘breakthrough’ policies is a realistic prospect for 2023—though the 
scope, speed, and execution of such policies of course remains uncertain.  
 
§ 
‘Reverse, Restart, Re-engage’: Conditional on a deep and comprehensive reform approach being taken, it will 
be indispensable—in our view—for actual policy implementation to focus on three urgent and near-term 
priorities: (1) reversing adverse and emergency macro policies put in place in the context of a war-time economy 
(high fx surrender rules, reliance on central bank advances, mandatory bond-buying requirements, etc); (2) 
restarting delayed or discontinued macro/structural/sector reforms (especially in the ease-of doing-business 
domain and in the monetary and foreign exchange regime); and (3) re-engaging deeply with external partners 
(defined broadly to include donors, lenders, foreign investors, and trading partners).    
 
 
§ 
Brighter outlook with ‘breakthrough policies’: Our baseline macro forecast for 2023 assumes that the near-
term reforms anticipated above (reversing emergency macro policies and re-engaging with external partners) 
would take place only gradually in the first half 2023, thus yielding limited immediate payoffs for macro 
conditions and outcomes in the 2022-23 fiscal year.  However, as these changes are more firmly in place by the 
start of the upcoming fiscal year, and as longer-term structural/sector reforms also begin to kick in, a more 
conducive set of conditions should be in place to boost investment, raise growth, and reduce fiscal/BOP deficits. 
Accordingly, for the coming two-year period, we find it reasonable to expect: growth reverting to its past norms 
of 8-10 percent as investment rates return to 30% of GDP; an initial spike in inflation (due to presumed exchange 
rate reforms) followed by a gradual drop thereafter; a modest tightening of monetary conditions as some of the 
recent excesses in credit to government are reversed to allow for growth in private sector credit; and an 
improvement in foreign exchange supplies on account of better global conditions, gradually rising donor flows, 
a re-engagement with international financial institutions, and an official exchange rate that is meaningfully more 
depreciated than its current levels and allowed to move in line with its market-determined levels.

• 
Ethiopia’s nominal GDP crossed Birr 6 trillion last year, marking a more than 2x increase in the past three 
years and 8x increase in the last 10 years. Nominal GDP growth has averaged 26 percent per year over 
the past decade, with 8% per year on average representing real growth while the remainder (~70% of 
average nominal GDP growth) reflecting a level increase in prices.   
  
• 
Reflecting net income from the rest of the world, the country’s net disposable income is about six 
percent higher than reported GDP, or Birr 6.5 trillion. 
  
• 
At the official exchange rate, Ethiopia’s dollar GDP has reached $126bn as of last year, though a 
conversion at the parallel market rate would imply a reduced US dollar GDP.

Growth and Recent Economic Activity, part 3 
 
• 
Within Sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopia’s USD GDP now stands at third place, significantly behind South 
Africa and Nigeria (with near $400bn and $500bn GDP levels respectively), but close to those of Kenya 
and Angola.  
 
• 
Seen over a twenty year perspective, and reflecting faster growth relative to most of the continent, 
Ethiopia’s GDP per capita—which now stands at $1,210 at the official exchange rate—has risen to 74 
percent of the SSA average from just 22 percent at the start of the millennium.

Growth and Recent Economic Activity, part 4 
 
• 
Looking at sector growth rates, recent growth is noticeably below the long term average for both 
industry and services but above trend for the agricultural sector. The sharp decline in industry growth 
reflects slowing growth in the construction sector, which is in turn a feature of declining 
government/SOE capital expenditure and dysfunctional markets for key inputs such as cement. Similarly 
weak growth in the manufacturing sector reflects forex constraints and ease-of doing-business related 
challenges. 
 
• 
Agriculture growth, by contrast, appears to be well above trend per official data and has been on a rising 
trajectory over the past five years. This could be explained by what have been favourable rains in most 
parts of the country in recent years as well as multiple government initiatives in cluster farming, 
mechanization, fruits/vegetable farming, and low-land, irrigation-based wheat cultivation.

Growth and Recent Economic Activity, part 5 
 
• 
The structure of Ethiopia’s real GDP shows agriculture and services both with nearly equal shares of the 
economy (at around 38-39 percent) followed by industry (which is mostly construction) at 23 percent.  
 
• 
A more detailed decomposition by the 19 sub-categories by which GDP data is reported shows that crop 
farming, construction, and wholesale/retail trading are Ethiopia’s three largest economic activities with 
a combined 60 percent of GDP. Other sizeable segments of the economy are the livestock sector (8% of 
GDP) as well as real estate and renting related activities (7% of GDP). Sectors such as manufacturing, 
banking, hotels, education all stand out for their relatively small shares of just 2 to 4 percent of GDP.

Growth and Recent Economic Activity, part 6 
 
• 
Growth rates for detailed GDP sub-categories show the strongest recent growth rates in mining 
(reflecting a low base), healthcare (COVID-related), banking, and construction over the past five years. 
While construction still registered 5% growth, this marks a sharp and continuous decline from the much 
more rapid growth rates of above 20 percent it registered five years ago; this deceleration is acting as a 
major drag on overall growth given construction’s dominant (2nd largest) share in total GDP.  
 
• 
The composition of GDP by the 19 main sub-categories shows the largest change in construction 
(+1.5ppts of GDP), followed by the financial and trade sub-sectors.

Growth and Recent Economic Activity, part 7 
 
• 
The largest share of GDP, crop production, remains dominated by small holder producers (some 16 
million households as of 2022) producing close to 356mn quintals. Corn, wheat, and teff remain the 
three largest grains produced taking up around two-thirds of the total volumes farmed.  
 
• 
Commercial farms (both private and state-owned entities) make up only 4 percent of total production.  
 
• 
Recent low-land and irrigation-based wheat farming initiatives are also becoming a growing part of 
Ethiopia’s crop production base, though the exact volumes from this third source is so far uncertain 
(with total additional output of much as 15-20mn quintals reported per press accounts).

Growth and Recent Economic Activity, part 8 
 
• 
Looking beyond GDP data, a review of high-frequency indicators for the 2021-22 fiscal year shows strong 
growth in trade and services (exports, tourism, remittances, and telecom activity) but mostly negative 
trends for industry sector proxies such as electricity and capital goods imports.  
 
• 
Particularly strong growth rates were seen in service sectors recovering from prior-year COVID impacts, 
i.e., tourism arrivals (+110%), EAL revenue (+45%), and Ethiopian Shipping Lines revenue (+94%).

Growth and Recent Economic Activity, part 9 
 
• 
For 2021-22, the most notable areas of negative performance were related to external and balance of 
payments developments, including in foreign loans, FDI, capital goods imports, and fx reserves.  For 
many monetary/fiscal variables (money supply, loans, deposits, and tax collections), growth rates look 
strong in nominal terms but these often translate to negative growth when expressed in real terms.

Growth and Recent Economic Activity, part 10 
 
• 
For the latest six month period, July-December 2022, the most notable areas of weakness are in exports 
(down 7 percent after three years of positive growth), in industrial park output (-23%), and in cement 
production (-23% and a cause of continued construction sector under-performance). By contrast, the 
last six month record has been positive for tourist arrivals, deposit/loan levels, tax collections, and FDI.

SECTION 2: Investment Trends 
 
• 
Ethiopia’s investment rate has fallen to just 25% of GDP, from 38% five years ago and 35% just a few 
years ago, which is a downward trend that poses serious risks to long-term growth if not soon reversed.  
 
• 
The counterpart to the drop in investment has been a rising share of consumption-to-GDP, reflecting in 
particular large current expenditure by outlays by Government.

Investment trends, part 2 
 
• 
Public investment has dropped more than private investment. The Government’s capital spending 
budget has shrunk from 6% to 2% of GDP in recent years as spending was re-allocated to conflict-related 
and other priorities, while investment by state enterprises fell as their scope for borrowing (especially 
non-concessional debt) has been cut back due to deliberate policies to limit overall debt accumulation.  
 
• 
Total public investment, reflecting both government and state enterprise activity, has more than halved 
from around 10% of GDP to near 4% of GDP as of 2022, by our estimates. At the same time private 
foreign investment and private domestic investment declined moderately (relative to GDP) or were 
broadly unchanged.

Investment trends, part 3 
 
• 
On the public sector side, some of the underlying sources of the decline in investment reflect reduced 
external borrowing for large infrastructure projects. Gross external borrowing of the Government is 
down from over $2bn in 2019-20 to just $0.8bn in 2021-22, or from 2.0% of GDP to 0.6% of GDP.  
 
• 
On the private sector side, part of the flat or moderately negative investment rate seen reflects a falling 
number of new investment project registrations and the corresponding capital from these projects.

SECTION 3: Inflation trends and dynamics 
 
• 
Ethiopia’s high inflation problem has persisted this past year and become even more entrenched in 
several respects—with the rate of price increases now remaining above 30% for over a year. Inflation 
were mostly in the teens in 2019 and 2020 but rose to an average of 27% in 2021 and 34% in 2022.   
 
• 
The latest inflation reading for December 2022 shows year-on-year inflation of 33.8 percent, which is 
identical to the 2022 average though a slight improvement from the May 2022 peak of 37.2%.

Month-on-month inflation rates (which better capture latest trends) showed some slight improvement 
in the last quarter of 2022 for overall prices, but remain high for non-food prices.

Inflation trends and dynamics, part 2 
 
• 
The annualized rate of month-on-month inflation (a measure of what inflation will be from here on if 
the current monthly pace continued) has shown a sharp drop for the past three months which bodes 
well for the 2023 outlook. 
 
• 
However, such drops in (month-on-month) inflation have often turned out to be short-lived over the 
past two years and it is thus not clear yet if there is a decisive downward shift in inflation rates.

Inflation trends and dynamics, part 3 
 
• 
While food inflation is moderating, non-food inflation (up 35% y-o-y) is becoming a more dominant 
contributor to overall inflation, particularly given large jumps seen for fuel, transport, alcoholic 
beverages, furnishings, and housing. By contrast food inflation has declined by 10 percentage points 
since early 2022 (now at 33% vs 44% then) and showed negative month-on-month inflation rates for 
two of the past three months following recent kiremt harvests.  
 
• 
Splitting the inflation data into its various components shows that domestically offered services are 
showing lower inflation rates (of near 27%), presumably reflecting more elastic local supplies and 
competitive conditions in this space. By contrast, mostly imported commodities are showing 50% y-o-y 
inflation, which is similar to the percentage change in the parallel exchange rate (and suggests many 
consumer goods are actually being secured in that market).

Inflation trends and dynamics, part 5 
 
• 
A significant source of Ethiopia’s inflationary pressures continue to emanate from large price spikes seen 
in global commodities such as maize, wheat, fuel, and edible oil.  
 
• 
Local prices for these commodities have largely followed the global trends, though more recently the 
local price trends for items such as wheat and corn have not (yet) turned downwards despite a decline 
in the international price indices.

Inflation trends and dynamics, part 6 
 
• 
Looking specifically at the food price index, this has now flattened out but not shown any level price 
declines. By contrast, the global food price index shows a level decline in prices of 20 percent, as seen 
in the FAO aggregate good price index. 
 
• 
This divergence suggests continued shortfalls in food supply (especially farmers’ marketable surplus) 
relative to demand and/or the presence of still other factors contributing to food inflation such as 
bottlenecks in transport, distribution, and retailing systems. 
 
• 
Looking at the inflation variability among specific food items, and seen over a three-year period, prices 
for cooking oil (virtually all imported) are now at 4x their January 2020 prices, beverages are at 3x those 
prices, and fruits & vegetables (domestically produced) are at 2x their prices of just three years ago.

Inflation trends and dynamics, part 7 
 
• 
The observed correlation between money supply growth rates with recent inflation rates continues to 
suggest a partial contributory effect of monetary growth to inflation; broad money growth rates of near 
20% in 2018-19 and 2019-20 corresponded to inflation rates in those two years of between 15-20 
percent, while broad money growths of near 25-30 percent in the last two fiscal years have coincided 
with inflation rates of 25-30 percent.  Plotting money supply growth of two quarters ago against current 
inflation shows a tight fit for the last two year period, implying lagged effects may also be important.  
 
• 
At the same time, however, the longer-term relationship between these two variables is not very tight 
or consistent, which indicates that monetary influences are only one of many determinants of inflation 
and suggests that non-monetary sources of inflation (such as food supply shocks, global price pressures, 
dysfunctioninng product markets, and exchange rate depreciation effects) also require attention.

SECTION 4: Deficits and Debt 
 
• 
Ethiopia’s budget deficit has worsened recently, but not dramatically so, given the deterioration from 
near 3% of GDP in 2020-21 to an estimated 4.6% of GDP last year.  
 
• 
There has, however, been a significant change in the way the deficit has been financed, with a switch 
from external to domestic borrowing that has resulted in virtually all of the deficits being covered by 
local lenders last year.

Deficits and Debt, part 2 
 
• 
Public debt expressed in dollar terms was broadly flat at $57bn for 2022, with about 53 percent of this 
now made up of domestic debt (in local currency) and the remaining 47 percent representing foreign 
debt.  
 
• 
Relative to GDP, the debt stock fell to 50% of GDP by June 2022. For the current fiscal year, using the 
expected USD GDP denominator for 2022-23 would imply that debt-to-GDP has fallen to 36% of GDP as 
of September 2022 (though this ratio reflects a conversion into USD GDP at the official exchange rate).

Deficits and Debt, part 3 
 
• 
There has been a significant drop in public sector external borrowing, from a peak of $3.5bn (in gross 
terms) five years to just $1.1bn last fiscal year and an even lower figure likely for the current fiscal year.  
 
• 
In net terms, or after accounting for annual debt service payments, net external borrowing has declined 
from near $2bn five years ago to a negative $1.1bn this past fiscal year, or a swing of $3bn dollars in 
annual net loan-related flows over the past five years.  
 
• 
The sharp swing in such net external loan flows is particularly concentrated for the state enterprise 
sector, whose new borrowing has almost ended in the last two years as part of deliberate policies 
intended to limit debt accumulation and associated debt sustainability risks.

Deficits and Debt, part 4 
 
• 
The net increase in Government debt of Birr 248bn (4.3% of GDP) last year was more than fully covered 
by domestic lenders given a Birr 24bn equivalent net repayment to foreign creditors.  
 
• 
The largest sources of borrowed funds were provided by CBE and NBE (each contributing about 28 
percent of the total), followed by private banks (24%) and pension funds (21%). By instrument, Treasury 
bills provided about three-quarters of total funding followed by NBE direct advances.  
 
• 
State enterprises saw a net debt accumulation of Birr 107bn (1.9% of GDP last year), reflecting a Birr 
25bn increase in their external debt stock (partly due to exchange rate effects) and well as Birr 82bn of 
net new loans from CBE.

Deficits and Debt, part 5 
 
• 
A review of the latest composition of Government domestic debt shows that, by lender, NBE comprises 
nearly half of all such debt, followed by pension funds (28%) and CBE (13%). The DBE and private banks 
hold small shares of the domestic debt of government at just 6% and 8% of the total respectively.  
 
• 
By instrument, central bank advances now make up close to a quarter of the Government’s outstanding 
debt stock (Birr 220bn out of Birr 927bn) as of September 2022 though this source of financing had 
almost been eliminated just two years ago (then only Birr 31bn or 7% of the total).  
 
• 
For state enterprise debt, this was mostly owed to CBE in the past, though a re-assignment of most of 
this debt to the Liability and Asset Management Corporation (LAMC) now shows this entity to be the 
largest creditor of state enterprises (at 64 percent of the total) per government debt statistics.

• 
The Treasury Bill market became the largest source of Government financing (by Instrument) last year, 
with close to Birr 300bn of outstanding funding provided via this market as of December 2022, up from 
Birr 201bn a year ago.  The net financing provided to Government by this market has dropped sharply 
however, to just 19bn in the last six month period vs Birr 78bn in the same period last year.  
 
• 
Nearly two-thirds of T-Bills sold are now of 365-day maturities while another quarter are of 182-day 
maturities. Effective interest rates (based on a weighted average of the four types of T-Bill maturities) 
have trended upwards since the market’s establishment and now stand at near 10% as of end-December 
2022, with some maturities (91-day Bills) yielding an even higher rate of 13% (reflecting participants 
apparent preference to hold just the shorter-dated Bills). 
 
• 
The yield curve as of December 2022 has shifted upwards from its year-ago levels, revealing higher 
financing costs for Government across all maturities, and especially for the shortest T-Bill maturities.

Deficits and Debt, part 7 
 
• 
Key debt sustainability metrics continue to show relatively moderate ratios for overall public debt to 
GDP and external debt to GDP. In addition, debt stock ratios when seen against current account inflows 
(exports, services, and remittances) are on a downward trend, However, public debt ratios relative to 
revenue have worsened due to the falling value of government revenue in USD terms.  
 
• 
On the debt service side, there is a markedly heavier burden observed, with annual external debt service 
of $2bn equivalent to roughly half of annual goods exports. Relative to all current account receipts, 
however, annual external debt service stands at about 13-16 percent of such annual fx inflows.

SECTION 5: Monetary Policy 
 
• 
Broad money supply has been growing at annual rates of 25-30 percent in recent quarters and is 
heavily being driven by a need to finance an enlarged budget deficit.  
 
• 
Net credit to Government now represents about a quarter of outstanding money supply (Birr 422bn of 
Birr 1,715bn) while it only represented about one-tenth of M2 (Birr 85bn of Birr 573bn) five years ago.

Monetary Policy, part 2 
 
• 
Credit to the non-government sector (including private sector) has been growing at rates of near 20 
percent for the last year despite growth of nearer 25 percent in the prior two years.  
 
• 
Relative to GDP, credit to the non-government sector is shrinking from a peak of 32 percent three 
years ago to just 18 percent as of September 2022; this reflects much lower growth rates in lending to 
the private sector and to state enterprises relative to growth in nominal GDP.

Monetary Policy, part 3 
 
• 
Estimates suggest that only about one-third of new credit flows in the past year were directed towards 
the private sector, or around Birr 159bn of the Birr 449bn in new banking system lending.  
 
• 
By contrast, almost half of new lending flowed to the Government while about 18% flowed to state 
enterprises.

SECTION 6: Banking Sector 
 
• 
The banking sector continued to show a significant expansion in 2022 with respect to deposits, loans, 
capital build-up, and operations (branches and employees).  
 
• 
At private banks, loans were up 35 percent for the fiscal year as virtually all of the Birr 181bn increase 
in deposits (from 627 to 809bn) went into net new lending of Birr 177bn (from 507 to 685bn).

• 
Profits continued to grow at both the private banks and the state bank. Pre-tax profits of Birr 30bn are 
roughly double their levels of just three years ago at private banks, and an almost similar record is seen 
at CBE, whose reported profits are only slightly below the combined profits of all private banks.  
 
• 
These profit levels have translated into an average Earnings Per Share (EPS) at private banks of 31.2 
percent in 2021-22, exactly in line with the prior five-year average.

• 
Both the return on average equity (ROAA) and return on average assets (ROAE) were below their long-
term averages.  
 
• 
The ROAA decline reflects a slightly greater reliance on the asset-heavy lending business segment 
(versus income from forex operations) while the ROAE decline is due in part to more aggressive capital 
raising efforts in recent years.

• 
Banks continue to display very high and steadily rising loan-to-deposit ratios, reflecting a desire to 
maximize their lending capacity for a given stock of deposits mobilized.  
 
• 
Accounting for reserve requirements and banks’ T-bill holdings, banks show what is effectively a near 
100 percent loan-to-deposit ratio over the last three years. This very high effective loan-to-deposit ratio 
implies a very limited cushion is being set aside for meeting unexpected customer cash withdrawal 
requests and explains frequent liquidity constraints faced at banks with high such ratios.

• 
Effective lending rates have trended upwards over the last five years, from an average of near 10 percent 
to 14 percent. At the same time, effective deposit rates (reflecting banks’ mix of saving and checking 
accounts) have only risen by 1 percentage point over the same period, allowing for an increase in the 
spread from around 7 to 9 percent. 
 
• 
Net interest margins, which capture net interest income expressed relative to the average loan balance 
of all private banks, have been slightly lower at 8 percent but have also trended upwards in recent years.

• 
Cost-to-income ratios remain favourable from a cross-country perspective but have moved upwards in 
the past two years reflecting on-going branch/staff expansions, large IT investments and higher 
compensation expenses.  
 
• 
Provisions for bad loans have also become an increasing cost line-item for the industry as a whole, rising 
from just 3 percent of total expenses a few years ago to 5 or 6 percent of total expenses in both of the 
last two fiscal years.

• 
Seen over a decade-long perspective, and applying a Dupont analysis to banks’ underlying earnings, the 
primary contributors to the strong returns of Ethiopian banks continues to be their sizeable net interest 
margins (6% of assets), significant other income (mainly fx fees and 3% of assets), low operational costs 
(5% of assets), and generally low provisions (0.5% of assets).  
 
• 
Looking at individual bank performance, the significance of net interest income earnings vary from a 
low of 3.2% to a high of 8.0% of assets while ‘other income’ ranges from a low of 0.6% to a high of 7% 
of assets. Similarly large variations are seen across banks in operating costs (ranging from 3.6% to 6.9% 
of assets) and in provision expenses (0% to 1.6% of assets).

• 
Non-performing loans at private have more doubled in the past two years (from Birr 10bn to 26bn) but 
remain low (only 4 percent) relative to total loans. Even including ‘special mention loans’ (those late by 
30 to 90 days), the combined stock of NPL and Special Mention loans is only around 8% of total loans.   
 
• 
The NPL levels within the private banking system are more than fully covered by banks’ paid-up capital, 
which has reached Birr 72bn, implying minimal financial stability risks given this large cushion. Most 
loans are also backed by collateral held by banks and so NPLs would not affect capital levels until 
recoveries are first exhausted from such collateral holdings.

Market share developments continue to show CBE having slightly more than half of total deposits in the 
banking system. Private banks’ have, however, been collectively moving towards the 50% mark in recent 
years and stood at 48% as of 2022.  
 
• 
Of last year’s Birr 337bn deposit increase, slightly more than half (Birr 182bn or 52%) of the deposit 
increase came from private banks, showing that private banks are already collectively gaining more 
deposit market share on an incremental basis.

Shareholder returns averaged 31 percent for the sector as a whole last year, with a wide dispersion 
seen around the average. Some of the best performing banks continued to see EPS returns above 40% 
while returns were in the mid- to high-teens for those at the lower end.  
 
• 
The dispersion in returns continues to reflect large variations in banks’ balance sheet composition, 
income structure, lending margins, cost structures, and efficiency metrics as seen the Figure 6.18

Banking sector, part 17 
 
• 
Latest banking data available up to December 2022 show total deposits reaching Birr 1.9 trillion, or up 
by 29 percent from year ago levels. Loans were up 37% year-on-year as of December 2022, pointing to 
still strong banking expansion for the first half of this fiscal year.  
 
• 
However, as was the case last fiscal year, most of this year’s nominal growth figures are being 
exaggerated somewhat by high inflation, such that real growth rates are actually negative (except for 
lending) in the case of deposits, assets, and capital.

SECTION 7: Balance of Payments (BOP) and Foreign Exchange Positions 
 
• 
Ethiopia faced a $2.1bn deficit in the balance of payments last fiscal year, reflecting a $4.8bn current 
account deficit that was only partially offset by a capital account inflows of $2.7bn. The BOP deficit was 
financed by drawing down central bank reserves (for about $1.5bn of the deficit) as well as the use of 
commercial bank fx (for the remaining $0.5bn).  
 
• 
The biggest contributor to the large BOP deficit was the $4bn jump in imports (from $14bn to $18bn), 
which was offset only partly by higher exports, service income, and FDI inflows.  
 
• 
Seen relative to GDP, imports were higher by 1.4 ppts of GDP, FDI was lower by 1.0 ppts of GDP, and 
government net external borrowing was lower by 0.5 ppts of GDP. Despite some offsets from higher 
services income (+0.6ppts) and remittances (+0.4ppts), the net impact of all BOP items was a BOP deficit 
equivalent to 1.7 percent of GDP ($2.1bn).

Balance of Payments and Foreign Exchange Positions, part 2 
 
• 
Gross fx inflows amounted to $23.4bn last, with the five largest items being service exports ($6.3bn), 
remittances ($5.6bn), goods exports ($4.1bn), FDI ($3.3bn), and other private transfers ($1.9bn). 
Splitting inflows by their type, private sector inflows were above their historical average, but aid and 
official sector inflows (grants and government/SOE borrowing) were below their recent norms. 
 
• 
Per latest BOP data, gross fx inflows actually rose by about $2bn last year, but fx needs rose by an even 
higher amount and explain the tighter fx conditions; in approximate terms, imports alone rose by $4bn, 
so the increase in gross fx inflows of $2bn still left a $2bn gap which was covered by a drawdown of 
reserves.  
 
• 
Regarding the operations of Ethiopia’s foreign exchange market, it is worth noting that gross fx inflows 
are close to $2bn per month and it is these inflows that cover recurrent monthly payments for imports, 
debt service, and other foreign obligations. Overall fx demand is evidently well above this monthly 
inflow figure, however, which explains the long waiting times to secure fx funds at banks. Contrary to 
popular perceptions, the level of NBE fx reserves (which represents a stock of accumulated savings from 
past fx inflows) is thus not the primary determinant of fx supplies and conditions but rather the volume 
and consistency of the monthly/yearly fx inflows noted above.

• 
Export growth has turned negative since mid-2022 and the first six months of the fiscal year (July-Dec 
2022) showed only $1.76bn of exports vs $1.89bn in the same period last year, or a decline of 7 percent. 
The largest export declines were seen in gold, chat and oilseeds. 
 
• 
Trends in the year-on-year growth of monthly export data, which better capture underlying trends, 
show that the export slowdown has accelerated since mid-2022 (to negative year-on-year growth rates) 
and especially so in the final quarter of 2022.

• 
Import growth has also slowed sharply from the 27 percent seen last fiscal year to just 8 percent in the 
first five months of this fiscal year (latest available data). Excluding fuel, whose imports are largely 
externally determined by global oil prices, underlying import growth has turned slightly negative. 
 
• 
As in the case of exports, analysis of the year-on-year growth in monthly data captures the most recent 
import momentum, and this reveals a sharp deceleration in import growth (to near zero y-o-y growth 
as of December 2022). This appears to reflect drops in global commodity prices and suggests import-
related BOP pressures may have already peaked in mid-2022 and could thus ease going forward.

• 
There has been a significant moderation in the annual depreciation rate, with the Birr exchange rate in 
the official market moving from 49.2 Birr/USD to 53.3 Birr/USD between end-2021 and end-2022.  
 
• 
This slower pace of Birr adjustment is translating into an annual depreciation rate of just 8 percent vs 
a 27 percent annual rate seen a year ago. The annualized rate of monthly changes has fallen to an 
even lower 3 or 4 percent in some recent months.

• 
Despite the relative stability of the exchange rate in the official market, the parallel market rate has 
declined sharply over the last year, depreciating by 50% in that market vs just 8% in the official market.  
 
• 
The spread between the official and parallel market rates is now at its highest in years and is a major 
indication of an unrealistic exchange rate.

• 
Seen from a cross-country perspective, the 8% Birr depreciation in the official market is in line with rates 
of exchange rate depreciation seen in Kenya (9%), South Africa (9%), Nigeria (7%), the EU (7%) and India 
(11%). However, the Birr’s depreciation of 50 percent in the parallel market is closer to rate changes 
seen in Argentina, Turkey, Egypt, and South Sudan (all of which also faced highly inflationary 
macroeconomic environments).   
 
• 
At the official exchange rate, the Birr’s value has actually appreciated (strengthened) in real terms 
relative to other currencies. However, at the parallel rate, the Birr has shown a net depreciation of 
around 15 percent.

• 
While depreciation rates exceeded inflation rates from mid-2020 to about mid-2021, the period since 
then has seen inflation rates exceeding depreciation rates and thus resulting in a real appreciation of 
the currency relative to trading partners.  
 
• 
A comparison of inflation and depreciation suggests a real appreciation of around 25-30 percent has 
taken place since mid-2021, representing a loss in competitiveness vis-à-vis trading partners if not 
compensated for by higher domestic productivity for key products and services.

More formal measures of the Birr’s value, measured by the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), suggest 
that it is now about 21% more appreciated than its past five-year average and 28% above its past ten-
year average.

• 
The share of M2 (local currency money supply) that can be covered by fx reserves has fallen sharply in 
the last few years, and further points to weakness in the BOP as well as signalling an unrealistic exchange 
rate.  This ratio, namely fx reserves to M2, has fallen to just 5 percent in 2022 versus a ten-year average 
of 15 percent and a peak of 35 percent about ten years ago. 
 
• 
Seen relative to some comparable countries, Ethiopia’s fx reserves/M2 ratio also stands out as unusually 
low and is notable for its significant deterioration in the last two years on account of both a drop in fx 
reserves and rapid monetary growth.

• 
Ethiopia’s sole Eurobond has recently shown a turnaround in its traded price from 50 cents on the dollar 
to near 70 cents on the dollar (a 40% price gain) since the peace agreement in November 2022.  
 
• 
Reflecting the recent price changes, the yield (to maturity) has moved in the opposite direction, 
declining from a peak of 45% to 30% as of early January 2023, a still-high level compared to pre-conflict 
averages of near 10%.

SECTION 8: A Thematic Overview and Implications for the Outlook 
 
• 
An overview of macro policies since the start of the conflict shows a period marked by multiple policy 
reversals albeit with some pockets of continued reform. With respect to macro outcomes, while two 
key indicators stand out for their sharp deterioration, the overall ‘scorecard’ is best described as 
showing a very mixed picture, with elements of ‘the Good, the Bad, and the Unknown.’  
 
• 
Looking ahead, the primary macroeconomic objectives given current conditions should and will most 
likely involve: (1) large reconstruction-related spending; (2) reviving investment to kick-start growth; (3) 
reducing inflation; and (3) addressing foreign exchange constraints in the economy.  
 
• 
The policy paths taken for realizing the above objectives could involve a largely ‘status quo approach’ 
or instead follow a series of ‘breakthrough policies’ for the year ahead. In our judgement, the former 
approach risks providing only a partial and temporary relief to macroeconomic pressures, while the 
latter approach promises to more comprehensively address the daunting challenges ahead.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 8.1: A 'Scorecard' on Macro Policy Measures Over the Past Two Years
Area
Sub-area
Remarks and Impacts
◾ To support growth, wide-ranging productive sector reforms have been initiated in multiple areas and appear most 
advanced and implemented in agriculture, tourism, and ICT, while less so in manufacturing and mining.
◾ Telecom reform has continued with the entry of an international operator that has added competition to the sector
◾ Privatization reforms in areas such as sugar are also continuing despite extended delays
◾ An active Treasury-Bill market has been created with participation by private banks and pension funds. 
◾ Longer T-Bill maturities and more competitive interest rates have been successfully introduced in the past two years
◾ Deficits have been controlled despite shocks that reduced revenue and significantly higher conflict-related spending
◾ Non-concessional borrowing has been ended and strict limits placed on new SOE debt accumulation. 
◾ Subsidies for fuel were cut significantly, representing a major fiscal measure that is working to limit future liabilities
◾ Loans of Birr 570bn (~13% of GDP) removed from the balance sheets of the largest SOEs (to help them focus on improving 
their future operations) and placed in a newly created special vehicle (LAMC) to find a long-term resolution to past SOE debts.
State Enterprise Reform
◾ Most large state enterprises have been over-hauled via new management, changes in governance, and stricter financial 
controls. A new holding company, Ethiopian Investment Holdings (EIH) has also been established to ensure even better 
performance among 27 of the largest SOES and to serve as a vehicle for co-investments with large foreign investors.
◾ Despite COVID and conflict related shocks, financial sector stability has been maintained with central bank forbearance 
allowing banks to weather NPL-related and other shocks.
◾ To introduce capital markets within the next two years, a Capital Markets Proclamations has been passed, over a dozen 
implementing regulations prepared, and a Capital Markets Authority established and made operational.
Govt capital spending
◾ Budgetary spending priorities were shifted substantially--given the needs of the conflict--with reductions in the shares 
devoted to growth-promoting capital spending alongside large increases in the shares devoted for defense 
Use of central bank 
advances by Govt
◾ After almost being discontinued two years ago as a sign of greater monetary independence, central bank advances rose 
substantially from Birr 31bn to Birr 220bn, and now make up close to a quarter of Govt domestic debt 
Mandatory Govt bond 
purchases on banks
◾ Despite the removal of a previous 27% bond purchase requirement to improve credit to the private sector, a similar 
requirement was introduced in 2022 mandating banks to buy the equivalent of 20% of their new monthly disbursements. 
Mandatory DBE bond 
purchases on banks
◾ A similar mandatory lending obligation was imposed on banks to annually allocate 1 percent of their outstanding loan 
balance (up to a cap of 10%), in order to provide loanable resources to the Development Bank of Ethiopia.
Room for growth in credit 
to private sector
◾ Despite a strong commitment to boosting private sector credit at the start of the HGER, the imposition of mandatory 
borrowing requirements on banks crowded out private sector borrowing and reduced its share of incremental new lending. 
FX surrender require-
ments on exporters
◾ A very high 80% of the fx proceeds of an exporter became subject to mandatory surrender requirement given the large fx 
needs of Government, affecting most acutely those involved in manufacturing given their intermediate import needs
New 3% levy on imports
◾ A new 3% levy on all imports (with few exceptions) enacted as a social welfare tax to help for post-conflict reconstruction
Import bans on consumer 
goods
◾ Outright bans were introduced on 38 consumer goods though this practice has long been discontinued as a tool in 
international trade and is not in line with a country's commitments to institutions such as the IMF (Article 8) or WTO.

A thematic overview and implications for the outlook, part 2 
 
• 
With respect to macro performance and outcomes, an overview of the full range of indicators shows a 
very mixed record with elements of ‘the Good, the Bad, and the Unknown.’ 
 
• 
Looking ahead, and given the set of prevailing conditions below, the primary macro objectives should 
and will most likely involve: (1) large reconstruction-related spending; (2) reviving investment to kick-
start growth; (3) reducing inflation; and (4) addressing foreign exchange constraints in the economy.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 8.2: A 'Scorecard' on Macro Outcomes and Indicators over the past two years
Area
Sub-area
Remarks
◾ Officially reported growth has still been maintained at mid-single digit levels, though there remain long-standing 
weaknesses and uncertainties about the reliability of Ethiopia's national account statistics
◾ Non-GDP indicators for many service sectors (telecom, transport, banking, tourism, shippling) are broadly consistent with 
the strong growth reported in GDP statistics, though agriculture output figures may be more uncertain and many industry-
related indicators suggest underlying weakness.
◾ Goods exports grew by 14% and 21% in the past two fiscal years, supported in many cases by volume increases
◾ Service exports grew by an impressive 29% in dollar terms last fiscal year, and by a still positive 6% in the prior (COVID-
impacted) year, reflecting airline performance and a recovery in hotels and tourism activity
FDI flows
◾ Despite COVID and conflict related shocks, FDI flows have fallen only slightly from near $4bn in 2020-21 to $3.3bn last 
fiscal year. 
◾ Deficits have risen but only from levels of 2.5% of GDP to 4.0 and 4.5% of GDP
◾ Public debt ratios have continued to decline 
◾ Debt service obligations continued to be met on foreign debt, avoiding default despite challenging fx conditions
Inflation
◾ Inflation has stayed high, broad-based, and persistent--rising from a mid teens rate in 2019 and 2020, to an average of 
27% in 2021 and an average of 34% in 2022
Investment
◾ Investment has declined sharply to 25% of GDP, from 35% of GDP a few years ago and a mid-30s rate in the last decade. 
Industry performance ◾ Industry growth has steadily trended downward, with construction growth decelrating from 25% six years ago to just 
4.9% last year, and manufacturing growth slowing from 22.9% to 5.8% over the same period. 
Foreign financing
◾ Gross foreign loans are down sharply from annual levels of near $3bn five years ago to an expected $0.7bn this fiscal 
year.  Net flows over the same period have fallen from a postiive $1.5bn average to a negative $1.5bn, or a swing of near $3 
bn (see Figure 8.4A). 
Rising central bank 
advances to Govt
◾ As noted earlier, after almost being discontinued two years ago as a sign of greater monetary independence, central 
bank advances rose substantially from Birr 31bn to Birr 220bn, and now make up close to a quarter of Govt domestic debt 
BOP deficit and loss in 
fx reserves
◾ Reflecting the impact of multiple items, including higher imports, lower loans/grants, and slightly lower FDI, the balance 
of payments recorded a $2.1bn deficit last year and resulted in a $1.5bn decline in central bank fx reserves. Including its 
foreign liabilities, the central bank currently shows a large negative net foreign asset position.
Overall agricultural 
expansion
◾ Data on crop production has been increasingly uncertain given lack of clarity on the full scale of recent low-land wheat 
initiatives (press reports indicate figures as high as 15-20m additional quintals) and also on the status of crop production in 
conflict-affected northern regions. Official estimates are thus likely to involve a more-than-usual level of uncertainty.
Economic losses from 
the conflict
◾ The full scale of economic, social and infrastructural losses arising from the conflict has been variously estimated by 
different offices and regional governments but a comprehensive and consistent compilation is not yet available. Some early 
reports suggest losses/damage of as much as $26bn, pointing to the immense opportunity costs of the two years of conflict.
Standards of living 
(poverty, unemploy-
ment)
◾ While macro data are reported with some frequency, including from NBE and MOF statistical releases, high frequency 
data on underlying social welfare trends remain limited, at least for nationwide and representative samples. This makes it 
difficult to make judgements about the links between macro performance and such social welfare measures for the most 
recent two-year period.

A thematic overview and implications for the outlook, part 3 
 
• 
Two macro indicators stand out for their particularly weak recent performance, namely the decline in 
the overall investment rate (down 10 ppts of GDP in just a few years) and the drop in the volume of net 
foreign financing flows (now negative for the first time in a decade).  
 
• 
The trend in both indicators captures the magnitude of recent shocks while also suggesting a way 
forward, namely the need for concentrated efforts/reforms towards reversing these very declines in the 
period ahead.

A thematic overview and implications for the outlook, part 4 
 
• 
Policy efforts to reverse the deterioration in the above two key indicators will require addressing each of 
their main sub-components. For investment, all four ‘pools’ of new investment flows merit attention, 
including: (1) government capital spending; (2) state enterprise capital expenditure; (3) private foreign 
investors; and (4) private domestic investors. Each contributes meaningfully to a balanced investment 
structure (as both the public and private ‘engines’ of the economy need to be fully functioning), and each 
requires a somewhat distinctive set of efforts and initiatives to be fully realized.  
 
• 
Similarly, reviving foreign loan inflows is best undertaken by a re-engagement with external partners 
that is broad-based and covers: (1) multilateral lenders (IMF, WB, AfDB, etc); (2) bilateral lenders; (3) 
debt relief providers; and (4) private lenders for qualifying state enterprises, projects, and private firms.

SECTION 9: The Macro Outlook under ‘Status Quo’ Policies 
 
• 
A ‘status quo scenario’ is intended to describe a situation where the mix of macro policies is largely 
unchanged—thus implying limited reversals of emergency macro measures, limited structural/sectoral 
reforms, and limited re-engagement with external donors. This could arise due to a lack of progress on 
the domestic political, security, or governance front or due to geo-political factors. 
 
• 
Under this state of affairs, the probabilities are high for investment remaining at its current subdued 
levels. It would also be reasonable to expect continued stresses in the industrial sector, waning foreign 
investor confidence, and lower foreign resources to help fund reconstruction and investment.  
 
• 
Accordingly, this scenario is likely to show low single-digit growth, still-high inflation, and persistent 
fiscal and BOP deficits, a combination prone to a ‘vicious cycle’ of deteriorating macro conditions.  
 
 
  
Figure 9.1: The Macro Outlook with 'Status Quo Policies': Features and Implications
General Area
Sub-area
Features and Implications
Higher budget deficit
Continued budget deficits of near 4% of GDP or more would imply (in the absence of foreign budget support) a 
large reliance on central bank advances (aggravating inflation) or on mandatory lending imposed on local banks 
(which works to crowd out private credit)
Lower government capital 
spending
Government capex of 2% of GDP, as was the case last fiscal year, would imply sharply reduced allocations for 
many public projects including roads, health/education facilities, and power, water, and urban infrastructure.
Resort to use of central 
bank advances
As a very inflationary form of financing, failing to reverse this fast-rising source of government financing would 
continue to undermine the fight against inflation
Mandatory Govt bond 
purchases
While understandable under emergency conditions, the use of forced bond purchase requirements undermines the 
positive direction started with the development of the Treasury Bill market; this policy also directly undermines 
efforts to boost credit to the private sector
FX surrender 
requirements
While this policy was also undertaken in the context of emergency conflict conditions, and may not be so adverse 
for most commodity exporters, its continued implementation would mark a major blow to the fledgling 
manufacturing sector, especially firms in industrial parks dependent on imported inputs 
Monetary policy reform
The current monetary framework is notable for its lack of a clear anchor to guide monetary policy, its heavy 
accommodation of government spending needs (via central bank advances), and its conflicting objectives that 
undermine its role if maintaining price stability.
FX regime reform
Although plans were in place to overhaul the foreign exchange regime with the Homegrown Economic Reform 
Plan, this has been put on pause over the past two years, thus keeping in place a major distortion affecting many 
corners of the economy
Structural reform
Fundamental structural reforms have been delayed or discontinued in key areas such as land access, tax 
administration, logistics, power, and access to finance.
Donors
The failure to re-engage with donors will imply foregone fx resources from grants of around $1bn, judging by the 
declines in official grants seen between 2018-19 (official grants of $2.1bn) vs that seen last year ($1.1bn).
Lenders and debt relief 
providers
The failure to re-engage with lenders will be associated with foregone fx loan inflows of around $2bn per year, 
judging by drops in such flows seen in just the last two years ($3.3bn in 2019-20 vs $1.1bn in 2021-22). In addition, 
the opportunity to secure debt relief on part of the substantial annual sum of $2bn being paid out in external loan 
repayments would be missed, implying a significant drain on fx reserves and near-term burdens on government. 
Foreign investors
While foreign investment has not dropped significantly (only from $4bn in 2020-21 to $3.3bn in 2021-22), a failure 
to maximize such investor flows reduces much-needed fx resources that can be secured in equity rather than debt 
forms. Given a peak FDI/GDP ratio of 4.5% percent seen in 2017 and 2018 versus the 2.5% of GDP registered last 
year, the foregone FDI amounts involved are on the order of 2 percent of GDP ($2bn to $3bn) were such inflows to 
return to their past levels relative to GDP. 
Trading partners
Given the loss of AGOA privileges to export duty-free to the US, a failure to reverse this benefit would affect 
$150mn of current exports but also undermines what had been a major basis for attracting foreign investment into 
Ethiopia's industrial parks, i.e., the promise of duty-free access to the large US market for basic products such as 
textiles, garments, footwear, and potentially other manufactured consumer goods.

A ‘status quo policies’ approach, part 2 
 
§ 
An illustrative macro outlook under a ‘status quo approach’ policy is highlighted below, starting with 
the presumption that the investment rate remains low, foreign financing flows fail to rebound from the 
currently depressed levels, and (as a result) fiscal and BOP positions continue to deteriorate.  
 
§ 
The main risks of this ‘muddle-through’ scenario are that inflation and unemployment conditions 
worsen as the productive sectors continue to weaken and government’s capacity to provide social and 
economic support dwindles in the midst of tightening resource constraints.

SECTION 10: A Macro Outlook with ‘break-through policies’ 
 
• 
A distinct break from Ethiopia’s recent policy path is a realistic possibility for 2023, in our view, as 
policymakers are signalling an intention to re-focus priorities towards the economy following two years 
of conflict. Upcoming revisions in the Home-Grown Economic Reform Program (HGER), the likely 
resumption of an IMF program with macro policy support, and new leadership at the central bank all 
suggest a move towards such ‘break-through policies’—though the depth, speed, and ultimate 
execution of such policies of course remains uncertain. 
 
• 
Given the current state of economic conditions, a meaningful package of such ‘break-through’ policies 
would—in our view—have to include: (1) reversing recently implemented emergency macro measures; 
(2) restarting reforms in both macro areas (monetary policy system and foreign exchange regime) and 
in structural/sectorial policies; and (3) re-engaging with external partners (across the full spectrum 
covering donors, lenders, foreign investors, and trading partners).  
 
• 
Conditional on a comprehensive package of policies of the type presented above, we offer below our 
macro forecasts for the real, fiscal, monetary, and external sectors under this presumed scenario. 
 
Current economic conditions provide strong grounds for embarking on a set of policies that can ensure 
reconstruction funding, increase overall investment/growth, reduce inflation, and boost fx resources.  A policy 
mix that could achieve these objectives would include (Figure 10.1): 
 
• 
Reversing recent emergency macro measures: Reforms in this area will mainly help to re-balance resource 
allocations between the public and private sectors, and the key changes in this respect would be in fx 
surrender rules, bond purchase requirements, and use of central bank direct advances.  
 
• 
Restarting macro, structural, and sector-specific reforms: This package of reforms—all of which were core 
elements of the first HGER Plan—is critical to boost domestic activity and employment. On the macro side, 
two critical reforms would involve the monetary framework and exchange rate policy.  
 
• 
Re-engaging with the full spectrum of external partners: This will be needed not just for large-scale and 
immediate reconstruction needs but also for inflows of long-term investment resources.  
 
The prospects for realizing the above mix of policies appears broadly positive, though of course issues of timing, 
speed of implementation and ultimate execution remain uncertain.  Many of the macro measures introduced in 
the past two years were meant as temporary fixes to withstand severe budgetary and balance of payments 
pressures in the context of a war-time economy and would thus naturally be expected to be undone once conflict 
conditions have subsided. This should apply, for example, to the high jump in defence spending (from Birr 21bn to 
Birr 80bn), the expansion of the budget deficit (from 2.5% to 4% of GDP), the increase in fx surrender requirements 
imposed on exporters (from 50% to 80%) and the mandatory bond-purchasing requirements (from 0% to 20% of 
new lending) imposed on commercial banks. In addition, as policy attention shifts towards recovery and 
reconstruction, the space for revisiting previously launched reform initiatives—in monetary policy, in the foreign 
exchange regime, in ease-of-doing-business measures—should be more favourable, while the obstacles that stood 
in the way of engagement with external partners should gradually recede as conflict conditions come to an end.

Figure 10.1: Macro Policy Priorities: The Case for a package of 'breakthrough policies' involving comprehensive reform
1 Reversing recent adverse and emergency macro measures
1 Budgetary stance
While significant improvement in the budget deficit is unlikely given high reconstruction needs, a greater use of foreign 
financing would reduce the amount of domestic borrowing required--helping cut the use of direct advances (positive for 
reducing inflation) and also boosting private sector credit
2 Government capital 
spending
A reversal to pre-conflict budget shares of social and capital spending would restore the pro-growth and poverty-reducing 
aspects of the budget. A reduction of the defense budget to its pre-conflict share of expenditure would also potentially 
release as much as 1 percent of GDP in extra funding for developmental priorities
3 Use of central bank 
advances for Government 
Reversing the rise in central bank advances (which were nearly brought down to zero three years ago) would help 
substantially in the fight against the policy-sources of persistent inflation
4 Mandatory Govt bond 
purchases on banks
The mandatory requirement for banks to purchase government bonds (at 20% of their monthly loan disbursements and for 
a fixed interest rate) undermines what had been a successful introduction of a more market-based Treasury-Bill market. 
The removal of this emergency measure would strengthen the Treasury Market, help further deepen confidence in the 
long-term development of Capital Markets, and also impose budgetary discipline on government deficit financing. 
5 Room for growth in credit 
to private sector
While a major success of reforms initiated with the HGER was the expansion of credit to the private sector (including a 
majority of new banking system loans going to private borrowers), this policy stance has been undermined with the large 
domestic financing of the budget deficit and with mandatory bond purchase requirements on banks. Re-orienting policy in 
this area would thus mark a return to the previous reform direction and boost private sector credit, paving the way for 
greater private investment and sector-specific growth.
6 FX surrender requirements 
on exporters
Current fx surrender requirements are a major operating constraint for most manufacturing business (less so for 
commodity exporters), and have led to even lower-than-normal capacity utilization rates in this sector as well as 
widespread work stoppages. Reverting the fx surrender requirement to levels that accommodate manufacturers 
(especially exporters in the industrial parks) would address what has become an existential issues for many firms in this 
sector. 
7 Import bans on consumer 
goods
Outright bans on imports have long been discontinued as a practice in international trade and are not in line with global 
commitments most countries now have to institutions such as the IMF (Article 8) or WTO. These can be replaced instead 
by more market-friendly approaches including high tariffs or high excises--both in line with international norms. 
2 Re-starting reforms, especially those already articulated under the Government's HGER
1 Macro policy reforms
Two key policy reforms initiated as part of the HGER but largely put on pause since the start of the conflict are: (1) reform 
of the monetary policy setting framework/system; and (2) reform of the exchange rate regime, including putting in place 
market-based exchange rates. Action on both fronts would--together with ongoing fiscal reform--fundamentally improve 
the macro policy mix to ensure price stability, a workable exchange rate system, and a realistic exchange rate.
2 Structural policy reforms
Priority structural policy reforms under the HGER aimed to address seven specific areas, including regulations (covering 
customs, tax, land, and other such government policies/agencies), SOE management, the power sector, telecom sector, 
trade, the logistics system, and uncompetitive domestic product markets. While some early progress was recorded in a 
few of these areas, a large backlog of reform still awaits for business-friendly, job-creating, and growth-enhancing 
conditions to be created in each of the above areas. 
3 Sector policy reforms
Targeted reforms in five focus sectors--agriculture, manufacturing, mining, tourism, and ICT--were the third main pillar of 
the HGER reforms and while perhaps further progress has been made in this domain compared to the others (in 
agriculture, tourism and ICT for example), there remains a long agenda to bring dynamism and growth to these productive 
sectors of the economy.
3 Re-engaging with external partners
1 Donors
While donor assistance has continued for humanitarian and social sector support over the past two years, the flow of 
official grants has declined in connection with the conflict. Restoring such grant flows--which were as high as $2bn per 
year prior to the conflict but $1bn last year--would represent a significant improvement in external support that would 
help direct beneficiaries while easing budget and BOP constraints.
2 Lenders
Multilateral institutions are the largest providers of loans to the Ethiopian government, including the World Bank, African 
Development Bank, and others. At the time, the IMF provides fx funding to boost central bank reserves directly. The pause 
in lending by these large institutions has implied foregone funding on the order of $2bn to $3bn per year, and restoring 
such funding is critical to ensure low-cost, long-maturity loans that can have significantly positive developmental, 
budgetary, and BOP impacts. 
3 Debt relief providers
Ethiopia's potential debt relief providers are primarily expected to be bilateral partners, i.e. other governments, as 
multilateral institutions are not envisaged to provide any debt relief under current schemes. Private bondholders may also 
not be a focus of attention given their very small shares involved ($1bn of $27 in external debt). Re-engagement with the 
core group of past bilateral lenders (mainly China, UK, France, Germany, and others) will make possible a rescheduling--
and thus immediate fx savings--on debt service dues to bilateral and private creditors (which amounted to $968mn in 
repayments last year for government & government-guaranteed obligations to these two groups).
4 Foreign investors
While foreign investor flows have not fallen materially over the past two years, it is arguably the case that they would 
have been substantially higher in the absence of the conflict. Active engagement with prospective foreign investors --
through internal ease of doing business reforms, making regulatory frameworks attractive in particular sectors, or via 
active FDI promotion activities--promises to potentially bring in several billion dollars of additional annual (non debt 
creating) FDI with corresponding benefits for investment, job-creation, growth, and exports.
5 Trading partners                   
(US-AGOA and EU)
Efforts to re-instate Ethiopia's AGOA benefits to ensure duty-free access to the large US market have significant 
implications for the long-term viability of Ethiopia's industrial parks, making the task of re-engaging with trading partners 
indispensable. Work on WTO accession and the AfCFTA would also be a further dimension of started-but-not-finished 
initiatives in this area.

Looking ahead, as the anticipated near-term reforms outlined above will likely take place only gradually in the 
first half of 2023, our macro outlook for the remainder of 2022-23 assumes minimal immediate payoffs for the 
remainder of this fiscal year. Accordingly we project growth will not fundamentally change from its recent trend 
and continue at around 6 percent for the current year, supported by agriculture expansion of 5 percent, on-going 
services improvement and weak industry growth. We expect inflation to remain elevated and end the fiscal year 
at 25 percent (despite current annualized rates of 14%), given the impulse from still expansionary monetary and 
fiscal policies and the on-going pass-through of fuel subsidy removals. Investment is likely to fall slightly from even 
last year’s subdued level to near 24 percent, in our view, as this year’s budget spending priorities have been in 
non-capital expenditure allocations. The fiscal deficit should come in line with the budget (near Birr 300bn or 4% 
of GDP), almost exclusively financed by domestic lenders. On the BOP, although the January-June 2023 period 
may see some tentative improvements in external inflows, we think that this will still be limited for the rest of the 
fiscal year and anticipate fx reserves ending at around $1.3bn by June 2023. (Figure 10.2). 
 
For the upcoming fiscal year, namely 2023-24, we 
anticipate a more conducive set of conditions to be in 
place to boost investment, raise growth, and reduce 
fiscal/BOP deficits. Conditional on a comprehensive 
reform approach being adopted, as is our baseline 
assumption, we expect key policy initiatives for the year 
ahead will involve: (1) stronger monetary measures to 
limit inflation (particularly by limiting central bank 
advances); (2) a sizeable Birr adjustment to move the rate 
towards a more realistic level as well as subsequent 
movements to ensure it reflects a market rate; and (3) a 
significant resumption of multilateral financing (including 
an IMF program and World Bank budget support), donor 
grants, and some measure of debt relief that starts to be 
realized in early 2024. More specific assumptions in these 
areas as well as broader macro projections are 
summarized below: 
 
• 
Growth: Growth should rebound strongly under an active reform scenario, as higher public and private 
investments (supported by higher external inflows—see below) raise government capital outlays and 
boost construction and rebuilding related activities. Accordingly, we expect industry growth will improve 
to 9 percent, which is essentially a reversal back to its recent averages. For agriculture, the trend growth 
of the past three years (6%) is taken as a reasonable benchmark and seems likely to be supported by the 
re-cultivation of previously disrupted farmlands (in northern regions) as well as by on-going initiatives to 
ensure fertilizer supplies, expand wheat farming, and intensify fruits/vegetables production.  The services 
sector, already growing strongly with the post-COVID recovery in airlines/tourism/hotel activity, should 
see even stronger expansion in line improvements in other economic sub-sectors. All things considered, 
growth of 8% or 9% is a plausible forecast for 2023-24 under a set of policies that reverses recent adverse 
policies, re-starts critical reforms, and resumes a deeper engagement with external partners. 
 
• 
Investment: Investment rates of 28-30 percent should be anticipated under a strong reform scenario as 
external financing is restored and private investment further encouraged. Extra public investment of 2-3

percentage points of GDP would be consistent with extra financing flows of $2.5-$3.5bn over the next 18 
months (reflecting a reform scenario), while an extra 1-2 percentage points of extra private investment 
($1.5bn to $2bn) is also realistic considering incremental foreign and domestic investment that would also 
be forthcoming in this case.  
 
• 
Inflation: A set of offsetting factors will work to keep inflation largely elevated even under a presumed 
reform scenario.  Factors helping reduce inflation include the already high base, a decline now being 
observed in most global commodity prices, and the brief but notable decline in the most recent month-
on-month trajectory (which is currently implying a 14% annualized inflation rate based on Q4 monthly 
price increase). The assumption of reduced central bank advances also helps limit the monetary 
contributions to inflation. At the same time, working in the opposite direction will be the assumed 
depreciation under the reform scenario, which we estimate will immediately add 5 to 7 percentage points 
to inflation (in line with past experiences and considering the share of imports in the price index and 
forecast exchange rate adjustment—see below). The net effect of the above factors will, in our view, take 
inflation to the high 30s in the second half of 2023, after which however there should be a firm downward 
trend as central bank financing to government is sharply reduced and as reform policies begin to address 
supply-side reforms.  On this basis, we expect inflation would fall to just below 20 percent by June 2024. 
 
• 
Fiscal Stance: While the budget deficit should be expected to widen, due to increased reconstruction 
spending, a much lower share of it will be financed domestically, thus leaving room for reductions in (highly 
inflationary) central bank advances and for stronger growth in credit to the private sector. Reflecting the 
fact that some portion of reconstruction spending will be on budget, we expect spending growth to 
outstrip nominal GDP growth (40% vs 33%) and see government budget spending crossing Birr 1 trillion in 
2023-24 and the deficit staying above 4% of GDP. Only 1.5% of GDP equivalent of the budget deficit (Birr 
190bn of 470bn) would be financed domestically, however, on expectations that close to $2.5bn of 
government external financing can be secured next fiscal year reflecting active re-engagement with 
international financial institutions and stepped-up reconstruction support. 
 
• 
Monetary Policy: Given a presumed policy re-orientation in this area (towards a greater focus on price 
stability and away from the use of monetary tools to actively boost growth), we expect reduced growth 
rates for money supply in the coming fiscal year. M2 growth is accordingly expected to decline from its 
current high growth rates (near 30% y-o-y) and trend towards growth that is at the lower end of the 20-
25 percent range. 
 
• 
Banking and private sector credit: Lower domestic financing needs of Government should facilitate a pick-
up in credit to the private sector as a smaller share of the banking system’s pool of loanable funds is 
absorbed by government and is instead made available to the private sector. Thus, despite lower overall 
credit growth due to tighter monetary policy, we still expect that there could be room for higher private 
sector credit, with growth of 30 percent or more possible reflecting reduced domestic deficit financing. 
 
• 
Exchange rate:  A central expectation—or indeed assumption—of the comprehensive reform scenario 
outlined here is that there is a level adjustment in the exchange rate to address the current unrealistic 
rate and the multiple distortions that it creates. In considering the scale of such a presumed rate 
adjustment, we review alternative criteria that might guide the size of the needed exchange rate 
depreciation, including for example whether the rate might move to either: (1) the parallel rate; (2) a rate

75 
somewhat stronger than the parallel rate (as that rate includes embedded fees/risks associated with the 
current scarce fx regime as well as an ‘illegality premium’); (3) a rate that would take the real effective 
exchange rate (REER) to various past benchmarks (such as the past ten-year average or to the REER that 
prevailed during a time of high fx reserve cover); and (4)  a rate that would restore the FX Reserves-to-M2 
ratio (which has fallen sharply this past year as the numerator fell and the denominator expanded) closer 
towards its past norms. Several of these measures suggest a rate adjustment of 30-40 percent would be 
needed in the official exchange rate and we consider this extent of depreciation as the baseline for the 
purposes of our projections. We also assume (simply to set a needed timeline for our projections) that the 
rate adjustment is enacted at the start of the upcoming fiscal year and that monthly depreciations are 
subsequently in place to bring the rate to its targeted 30-40% adjustment by the middle of the upcoming 
fiscal year (Figure 10.3). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
External Sector: With respect to the balance of payments, three key developments—the presumed 
exchange rate adjustment, the re-engagement with donors, and the easing of global commodity prices—
lead us to project a modest overall BOP surplus for next year, the result of which would be an equally 
modest build-up of fx reserves towards a level that represents nearly two months of import cover.  We 
expect export growth to pick up to 10% next year (as industrial and mining exports return to past levels), 
while imports would be expected to grow by at least 10% as reconstruction spending and re-building 
activities are launched. Services income should continue its recent trend growth of 8% per year, thus 
reaching $7bn for next year.  On remittances, exchange rate adjustment should boost inflows to above 
$6bn next year, while other private transfers and official transfers (bilateral/multilateral grants) should 
both rise with re-engagement. A pick-up in FDI is also to be expected for the first full year of reforms (due 
in part to privatizations already in the pipeline), while government borrowing rises substantially with 
assumed international financial institution funding.  Alongside an assumed IMF program that directly 
boosts central bank reserves, we expect the net impact of all of the above would be to take reserves to 
near $3.0bn by mid-2024.

In sum, even for what would only be the first full year of policy change, the implementation of comprehensive 
reforms can, in our view, prevent a further deterioration in key macro indicators, improve sentiment among 
domestic and external investors, and trigger substantial external support which—all taken together—would 
put Ethiopia back on a much stronger growth and developmental path for the period ahead.
