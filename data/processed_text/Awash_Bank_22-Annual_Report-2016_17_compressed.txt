Board Chairman’s 
Message
I am greatly delighted for the opportunity to 
welcome you all on behalf of the Board of 
Directors of Awash Bank (AB) to the 22nd 
Shareholders Annual General Meeting of the 
Bank for FY 2016/17. I also feel proud to 
announce to all respected shareholders, 
esteemed 
customers, 
and 
all 
other 
concerned stakeholders that our Bank has 
registered an unmatched results in all Key 
Performance Indicators (KPIs) to uphold its 
leading position for the financial year ended 
June 30, 2017. 
 The 22nd Annual General Meeting of Awash Bank is unique in a manner that it is being held after 
a ground-breaking corporate rebranding was made for the first time in its history on the Bank’s 
logo, color and trade mark. The meeting is also historical in that it is being conducted after the 
Bank has successfully accomplished its first year performance of the ten years strategic journey 
under the theme "Transforming AB: Vision 2025". 
The envisioned strategy to Becoming One of the Top Ten Private Commercial Banks in East 
Africa by 2025 was put into effect in the financial year 2016/17 and has brought about 
unprecedented results in all operational areas like deposits, loans and advances, income and 
above all profit. 
. 
The outstanding results achieved during the first year of the ten years transformational journey 
is a clear indication that the strategy crafted and followed has reinforced the strong position of 
the Bank. It also clearly demonstrated that the Bank is on the right track to attain the targets set 
at the end of the strategy period as per the newly implemented business and operating models. 
As far as the IT projects on hand are concerned, our Bank has also registered estimable results. 
We have launched additional technologies such as Trade Innovation (TI), Messaging and 
Collaboration Solution, Dispute Management, Leave Management Systems, Foreign Currency

Registration System and Materials Management System that can support in facilitating the 
activities of our customers. The digital technologies support our customers to use online banking 
and make money transfers the easiest possible.  
The construction of own buildings have been well underway and among others, the major 
breakthrough was the inauguration of the ten-storey mixed use building of Balcha Abanafso in 
Addis Ababa and the eight-storey mixed use building of Hawassa Building in Hawassa Town. The 
construction of a four-storey Ada’a Building and a two-storey Bedessa building are on the verge 
of completion and their inaugurations are expected to take place soon. From the new building 
projects, the construction of Jimma building has already been started. 
. 
I would like to reiterate that the impressive achievement registered by the Bank would have been 
impossible without the support of our esteemed customers and respected shareholders; 
relentless efforts of the Board of Directors; strong leadership of the Management and hard work 
of the entire staff.  
I would like to take this opportunity to underscore that we are cautiously optimistic about the 
year ahead despite continuing fierce competition amongst local banks. We will work day and night 
for the success of our ten years transformational journey as the source of our confidence are the 
capable, competent, qualified and trustworthy Management team and the entire staff. We will 
continue to add value to our shareholders as well as to our communities.  
In conclusion, on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Bank, I would like to thank once again all 
staff members of the Bank for their tremendous efforts, passion and resilience in delivering 
results and enabling our Bank to drive steps forward. I would also like to thank the National Bank 
of Ethiopia (NBE) for its regular support; AB’s Shareholders and the Board of Directors for their 
support and guidance and the Management of the Bank for its commitment. My very special 
thanks go to our customers for their loyalty for the success of AB and we look forward to their 
continuous engagement with us in the future. 
Finally, I look forward to the continuation of a high level of Ethiopia’s economic growth within a 
stable macro-economic environment and to AB’s successful operation in the 2017/18 financial 
year and beyond. 
God bless you all!

Chief Executive Officer’s Statement  
I am pleased to address to all respected 
Shareholders, Board of Directors, members 
of Management and the entire staff, 
esteemed 
customers 
and 
all 
other 
stakeholders of Awash Bank that our Bank 
has, for the second time, registered the 
highest ever operational performance in the 
history of private banks in the financial year 
ended June 30, 2017.  
The Ethiopian Economy has been showing a 
structural change in recent times. As a result, 
while the share of the agricultural sector is 
declining, industry and service sectors are 
somehow growing and this has created 
favorable 
opportunities 
for 
better 
performance of financial institutions. 
Though the Ethiopian Economy was generally showing a multi-faceted growth, the performance 
of the export sector was far below the target set and as a result, the amount of foreign currency 
generated during the year could not sufficiently respond to the ever-increasing demands of 
customers engaged in import business. This was mainly caused by a decline in the international 
price of the major export item of the country, mainly coffee. The imbalance in the performance of 
the import and export sector will obviously widen the current account deficit of the country, which 
calls for exertion of strenuous effort in all sectors of the economy to reverse the situation in the 
times to come.

In spite of the ups and downs, however, I feel honored to reiterate to all concerned stakeholders 
that the achievement of our Bank for the year ended June 30, 2017 was extra-ordinary by all 
standards. 
The Bank’s profit before provisions and tax significantly grew from Birr one billion to Birr 1.44 
billion, up by Birr 440 million or 44% from the preceding year. The gross profit registered is the 
highest in the history of private banking industry as well as in the history of Awash Bank! The 
paid-up capital of the Bank also surged from Birr 2.24 billion to Birr 2.65 billion, i.e. an increase of 
Birr 402 million and earnings per share (EPS) has similarly shown an increment from 371 in 2016 
to 409 in 2017 for a par value of Birr. 1,000. 
Total income registered was an all-time high of Birr 3.76 billion in 2016/17 as compared to Birr 
2.82 billion in 2015/16. The lion’s share of the income in the year just ended was accounted for by 
interest income (68%) followed by commission and service charges (17%), gains on foreign 
exchange dealings (7%) and other income (7%). 
On the other hand, as a result of opening of new branches in different parts of the country, 
provision of technology enabled services, continued engagement in image building activities and 
generally augmented operation of the Bank, total expenses increased from Birr 1.84 billion in 
2015/16 to Birr 2.41 billion in 2016/17, depicting a growth of Birr 575.7 million. Of the total expense, 
interest expense accounted for Birr 914 million, which is nearly 38%, and the remaining Birr 1.496 
billion, or 62%, is accounted for by salaries and benefits, general and administrative expenses, 
depreciation and provision for doubtful accounts. 
As a result of stiff competition in the industry, the challenge of deposit mobilization was 
extremely visible. With all the challenges, however, the total deposit of our Bank, including margin 
held on letters of credit, grew by Birr 8.55 billion (35%) from last year same period and reached 
Birr 32.78 billion as at end of the reporting period. This is the highest amount of deposit mobilized 
in a single year in the history of private banks and also in the history of Awash Bank. The 
achievement registered is the result of relentless effort of all organs of the Bank in aggressive 
deposit mobilization activities and the confidence of the general public on us as their trusted 
custodian.

Total asset of the Bank has significantly increased from Birr 31.1 billion of last year to Birr 41.97 
billion in the year just ended. This is an all-time high Birr 10.8 billion (34.8%) increment in a single 
year! The increment in this regard is mainly credited to a significant rise in loans and advances 
availed to different sectors of the economy by Birr 7.2 billion followed by a rise in cash on 
hand/bank balances, deposit with local and foreign banks and purchase of NBE’s bills.  
As far as the Bank’s non-performing loans is concerned, it stood at 1.6% at the end of the reporting 
period and that was far below the 5% threshold set by the National Bank of Ethiopia.  
In order to be very closely accessible to the public, our Bank has opened 76 new branches during 
the year and the total number of branches of the Bank has reached 316 at the end of June 2017. 
Awash Bank continued to be the leading from among private banks operating in the country in 
terms of branch network. 
Financial year 2016/17 was in general a remarkable year to Awash Bank in the following respects:- 
1.
Our Bank has started fully implementing its Vision 2025 Transformation Project and its
first year of operation was very successful in all parameters. The attainment of the targets 
set for the year is a clear indication that our Bank will live up to the laid down grand vision
of Becoming One of the Top Ten Private Commercial Banks in East Africa by 2025!
2.
As part of “Transforming AIB-Vision 2025” corporate transformation endeavor, we have
re-branded our trade name, logo and other related activities in consultation with a Kenyan-
based famous branding company. The new trade name and logo were officially launched
on April 21, 2017 in the presence of selected shareholders, stakeholders and other invited
dignitaries.  The change of our trade name and logo was also communicated to concerned
Government bodies and all financial institutions.
3.
Extensive image building activities were also carried out during the year. As “Deeds, not
words, matter most”, our Bank’s noble deed of discharging its corporate social 
responsibility to a number of local charity associations as well as to the drought victims 
in some parts of our country has brought about an unshakable reputation to our Bank and 
a glimmer of hope to the beneficiaries!

Report of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors of Awash Bank (AB) is pleased to present the Annual Report and 
Audited financial statement of the Bank for the financial year ended June 30, 2017 to the 
22nd Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of the Bank. 
During financial year 2016/17, Awash Bank (AB) has performed exceptionally well in the 
Bank’s 23-year history, that cemented its position as the leading private bank in Ethiopia 
in terms of deposits, loans and advances, total assets, profits, paid-up capital and branch 
networks. This strong performance of the Bank mainly reflects the favorable domestic 
economic environment in which the Bank operates, particularly robust economic growth 
of Ethiopia and stable inflation and the Bank’s first year successful implementation of the 
10 year transformation roadmap initiatives.  
Being Ethiopia’s largest private bank, AB is the major provider of financial services in 
Ethiopia, next to the Government owned Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, thereby playing a 
key role in promoting the socio-economic development of the country. Both the 
operational and financial results recorded in 2016/17 reveal the true potential of Awash 
Bank and the most likely achievement of the Bank’s aspiration to become one of the top 
ten private commercial banks in East Africa by 2025. 
1. Operational Performance
Financial year 2016/17 witnessed the best performance ever in the history of the Bank in 
all operational areas of the Bank. 
1.1     Mobilization of Deposits 
Total deposits of the Bank, including margins held on letters of credit, surged remarkably 
by 35 percent(Birr  8.5 billion) and reached Birr 32.8 billion at the end of June 2017 from 
Birr 24.2 billion during the same period of last year. As compared to the Bank’s last five

years average growth rate of 24 percent per annum, this year’s growth rate was highly 
commendable. It is also the highest amount of absolute deposit growth registered among 
local private banks operating in Ethiopia during the review period.   
The sustainable and steady growth in the total deposits of the Bank largely reflects a 
deep customer relationship built up over two decades of operation, the trust and 
confidence earned from customers through wide branch networks, alternate service 
delivery channels, efficient customer services and expansion of customer base.

1.3 International Banking Services 
During the period under review, Awash Bank has made tremendous efforts to enhance its 
foreign exchange earnings. The Bank has financed the priority sectors, particularly the 
export sector, at preferential rates. The Bank also created conducive environment for 
acceptance of international payment cards (VISA, Master Card and China Union Pay) at all 
of its ATMs and POS terminals. 
In view of encouraging the inflow of remittances through international money transfer 
agents and Awash Bank SWIFT (AWINETAA), the Bank has introduced an incentive 
mechanism that awards winners with the prize through the lottery system. In this 
context, the Bank has successfully conducted the 1st and 2nd round of the incentive 
mechanism during FY 2016/17. Efforts made in this regard have yielded encouraging 
results, though the lottery system was immediately applied by other banks, thereby 
leading to a fiercer competition in the banking industry. 
Another measure taken by the Bank during the period under review was forging a 
partnership agreement with two new international money transfer agents; namely, 
CashXpress/Alanseri and Money exchange transfer.

1.5 Capital 
The core capital base of the Bank was strengthened in 2016/17, in line with the decision 
of the 13th Extraordinary General Meeting of AB’s Shareholders to raise the paid-up 
capital of the Bank to Birr 3 billion by end of June 2018. Accordingly, the total paid-up 
capital of the Bank rose to Birr 2.6 billion as at end of June 2017, depicting a growth of 
Birr 402.6 million as compared with the same period of last year. A short fall of Birr 354.7 
million from the Birr 3 billion mark is expected to be fulfilled by the end of June 30, 2018 
following the dividend payout for FY 2016/17. 
It is worth mentioning here that the paid-up capital of AB has already exceeded the Birr 2 
billion minimum paid-up capital that all banks operating in Ethiopia are advised by the 
National Bank of Ethiopia to fulfill by the end of June 2020. At the same time, the capital 
adequacy ratio of AB by far exceeds the regulatory minimum requirement of 8 percent. In 
this regard, the determination of AB’s shareholders to continuously raise their Bank’s 
paid-up capital beyond the regulatory requirement indicates their commitment to build 
the capital base of their Bank in an orderly and sustainable fashion so as to make AB one 
of the competitive and strong banks at the regional and global arena.

2. Financial Performance
The financial performance of Awash Bank for the financial year ended 30th June 2017 has 
been impressive as the Bank has registered a leap-forward growth both in revenue and 
profits. 
2.1 Income 
The total income of the Bank registered an all-time high growth rate of 33.3 percent(Birr 
939.8 million) and reached Birr 3.8  billion in 2016/17 from Birr 2.8 billion  of last year, 
mainly underpinned by Birr 665 million or 34.6 percent growth in interest income and Birr 
197.9 million or 44.4 percent growth in commission and service charges. The surge in 
interest income mirrors growth in the volume of loans and advances extended to different 
sectors of the economy while the increase in the commission and service charges was 
attributed to expansions in the Bank’s financing of trade related operations.

The total expenses of the Bank went up by Birr 575.7 million or 31.3 percent to Birr 2.4 
billion in 2016/17 from Birr 1.8 billion in 2015/16. A Birr 132.4 million or 16.9 percent 
increase in interest expense was solely the result of over Birr 5 billion increase in the 
volume of interest bearing deposits; namely saving and time deposits mobilized by the 
Bank in the review period. Similarly, salary and benefit expenses grew by Birr 232.8 
million to Birr 848 million in 2016/17 owing to adjustments in staff salary and benefit 
packages and recruitment of additional staff to fill in vacant posts at the Head Office, 
existing and newly opened branches.
