Foreword 
Financial inclusion is an essential prerequisite for sustainable development, inclusive growth and will be a 
fundamental enabler for the stability of the financial system, job growth, digital transformation, and our 
country’s continued economic development. 
 
Over the past ten years, the country’s economy has averaged double-digit growth, lifting many Ethiopians out of 
poverty and improving lives across the nation. Increased financial inclusion for all Ethiopians has been an 
important factor in this achievement, and continued expansion of financial services will be essential for 
maintaining the momentum. Recognizing that sustainable, broad-based economic growth and poverty reduction 
will be challenging without continuing the advancement of scale, depth, and quality of financial services across the 
country, the Government of Ethiopia identifies increased financial inclusion as a national priority. 
 
Ethiopia has made major advances in financial inclusion in recent years. A Refreshed National Financial Inclusion 
Strategy has been developed to build on this momentum, and capitalize on new opportunities.  With the 
National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) 2016, ratified by the Council of Ministers, Ethiopia strengthened its 
commitment to financial inclusion as a strategic priority – across ministries, other government institutions, and the 
private sector. In response to actions undertaken since then, financial inclusion levels have increased markedly – 
from 22% to an estimated 45% in 2020. By building on this momentum and capitalizing on new opportunities, 
including mobile money, Ethiopia will drive financial inclusion further. Doing so will require dedicated and 
sustained efforts and investments, especially in rural areas and for women and other underserved demographics. 
Expansion of innovative products and services (both conventional and sharia compliant), including digital finance, 
will require regulatory adjustments as well as expanded consumer protection and digital literacy efforts – while 
achieving universal scale will require strengthened financial institutions and payments instruments issuers. 
 
Technological advances and our country’s strong economic and demographic foundation offer a chance for 
rapidly-increasing financial inclusion levels, with the potential to transform the Ethiopian economy. Many 
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are among the international leaders in financial sector innovation, in particular for 
digital and mobile finance. Ethiopia has the potential to learn from, catch up to, or even overtake many of these 
countries and become a financial inclusion leader. Our large, young population will be both a strong workforce and 
a large consumer base. The rapid economic development will drive demand. Continued advances in infrastructure, 
especially in electricity and mobile connectivity, will serve as foundational enablers. Ongoing and future reforms of 
the financial sector will further unlock our country’s innovative powers, and targeted interventions will create and 
derive business cases for financial inclusion. 
 
This Revised National Financial Inclusion Strategy charts a path for scaling, deepening and cut-cross programs 
and actions to boost financial inclusion during the strategy period and calls for all stakeholders, in particular the 
financial sector players, commitment and cooperation to make this opportunity a reality. 
 
The Government of Ethiopia (GoE) recognizes the many opportunities and needs for immediate and sustained 
efforts to increase financial inclusion in Ethiopia. The National Financial Inclusion Strategy 2021-2025 was 
refreshed in close collaboration with stakeholders across the public and private sector in an effort to define a 
coordinated plan to transform financial inclusion for millions of Ethiopians. The collaborative effort in developing 
this Strategy has instilled ownership in all stakeholders, a critical element to drive the implementation of this 
Strategy and its Actions. Here, we would like to personally thank all stakeholders who availed their treasured time 
to meet with the NBE team and provide valuable input and insight in the design of this Strategy. 
 
Finally, committed and resolute implementation of this Strategy is critically necessary. We need to act now, 
together, to make  this opportunity a reality.

Executive Summary 
1. Introduction 
 
The National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) formulated in 2016 came to an end in December 2020.  
To accommodate changes and the rising new opportunities emerging during this period particularly 
within the financial sector, align with Home Grown Economic Reforms and with the aspiration to chart 
with the level of financial inclusion achieved by peers, the Strategy is refreshed to cover a period 
2021-2025. 
 
2. Rationale for refreshing the National Financial Inclusion Strategy-II  
The main reasons for refreshing the National Financial Inclusion Strategy-II (NFIS) are summarized here 
below: 
 
First, the rise of new opportunities and enablers within the financial sector:  With the existing National 
Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS), Ethiopia strengthened its commitment to financial inclusion as a 
strategic priority – across ministries, other government institutions, and the private sector. Partly 
through the implementation of the actions of this strategy, significant progresses and changes that can 
serve as fundamental enablers to further expanding financial inclusion have been made since then. 
Remarkable achievements include: 
 
Amendment of Banking Business Proclamation that, among others, permits the establishment 
of full-fledged interest free banks; 
 
Amendment of Insurance Business Proclamation that, among others, permits the establishment 
of full-fledged microinsurance companies and takaful; 
 
Issuance of a new proclamation to provide for Movable Property Security Right;  
 
New and amendment directives1 on agent banking; financial institution branch opening; 
Payments Operators and Issuers’ Licensing; Financial Consumer Protection; Operationalization 
of Movable Collateral Registry; Codification, Valuation and Registration of Movable Properties 
as Collateral; 
 
Issuance of National Financial Education Strategy; 
 
Formulation of  National Digital Retail Payment Strategy ( in the process of ratification);   
 
The creation of central electronics system for Movable Collateral Registry when collateralized;  
 
Enhancement of the Credit Reference Bureau; and 
 
Extension of Rural Financial Intermediation Program (RUFIP) III.  
 
These enablers for financial inclusion were not in existence during the formulation of the 2016 strategy. 
This has created major restraint on the progress of financial inclusion and lots of opportunities were 
lost.  On the other hand, the reform efforts have significantly changed the financial ecosystem and can 
be charted to further stimulate and advance financial inclusion, as having direct impact and vast 
opportunities for the upcoming strategic period.

Licensing and Authorization of Payment System Operators Directive No. ONPS/02/2020; Licensing and Authorization of 
Payment Instrument Issuers Directive No. ONPS/01/2020; Establishment and Operation of Credit Reference Bureau Directives 
No. CRB/02/2019; Operationalization of Movable Collateral Registry, Directive No. MCR/001/2020;   
 
ix  
Second, Homegrown Economic Reform Agenda: New and conducive socio-economic environments that 
broadly provide with opportunities to further scale up and deepen financial inclusion have been evolving 
ensuing the Homegrown Economic Reform Agenda (HGER):  National Digital Transformation Strategy, 
“Digital Ethiopia 2025”; Plan of Action for Job Creation; Ministry of Agriculture ten-year plan; to 
partially privatize Ethio-telecom; National Gender Strategy; Initiative taken for National ID, among 
others, can be cited. Aligning the financial inclusion efforts with these evolving opportunities drives it to 
a greater advancement.    
  
Third, completion of most of the actions of the 2016 Strategy: The implementation period for the first  
National Financial Inclusion Strategy (developed in 2016) ended in 2020. This Strategy had mapped a 
comprehensive and interrelated framework for defining interventions to advance financial inclusion in 
Ethiopia: a) Build financial infrastructure; b) Expand innovative products and services; c) Advance 
financial consumer protection; and d) Promote financial education. Through the execution efforts, 
around 80% of the total 49 actions of the strategy, charted under the stated interventions, have been 
completed and produced strong results, with several targets exceeded. More specifically, the major 
achievements, besides those highlighted above, include:    
 
The number of transaction accounts per 100 adults grew by a factor of ~2.4 and now averages 
159 transaction accounts per 100 adults, compared to a 2015 baseline of 682.  
 
Ethiopia has made significant progress in the last six years and increased the financially included 
adults by more than double i.e. from 22% in 2014 to ~45%3 in 2020.  This has exceeded the 
target by 77%; 
 
Bank branches grew ~1.7, from seven to twelve branches per 100,000 adults, outperforming 
the initial target of 8.8 per 100,000 adults.  This has exceeded the target by 50%;  
 
Agent network has grown significantly in the last four years. In 2016, banking and mobile 
money agents were almost non-existent, with a baseline of three per 100,000 adults. This has 
increased by a factor of over 25 and reached to 77 agents per 100,000 adults as of 2020;  
 
Digital finance footprint has increased substantially over the past four years with debit cards 
growing by a factor of four; over 9 million mobile banking transactions; and 1.4 million online 
banking transactions;   
 
In 2016, mobile money was extremely limited, with mobile money wallets making up less than 
1% of transaction accounts. Since then, mobile money accounts have increased by a factor of 
10, with ~8 million mobile money wallets registered as of June 2020; 
 
The percentage of Ethiopians reporting saving in formal institutions has risen steeply from 14% 
to ~30% of people in the past six years; and 
 
The percentage of adults reporting having a loan at a regulated financial institution rising 
slightly to 11% from a baseline of 10%. 
 
This Refreshed National Financial Inclusion Strategy, therefore, aimed at building on the success of the 
first Strategy, and leverages new opportunities to chart a path for the next 5 years (2021-2025). 
 
Forth, aspiration to further advance financial inclusion: Although Ethiopia has been advancing by more 
than double in the past five years,  the level of  financial inclusion compared with benchmarked 
                                                          
 
 
2 NBE supply side data 
3 Findex 202 was not conducted due to COVID-19.  For the purpose of this document, the level of financial 
inclusion is estimated to be 45% based on past Findex data (22% in 2014 and 35% in 2017) as well as using the 
percentage point increase by LSMS 
 
x  
counties, however, indicates that Ethiopia has scale and vast opportunities to grow across several 
indicators.   
Building on these successes and capitalizing on new and emerging opportunities, Ethiopia can further 
advance the level of financial inclusion and can follow the foot-steps of regional peers e.g. 83% for 
Kenya and 77% for Rwanda4; compared to ~45% for Ethiopia.  
Fifth, lack of focus on severely underserved regions and areas; widening gap between men and women 
financial inclusion; low level of development and expansion of digital financial services including mobile 
money; and under developed sharia compliant financial products and services have been identified as 
the main and forefront challenges that negatively impact further advancement of financial inclusion in 
Ethiopia. In addition, new opportunities have been emerging following the implementation of the first 
NFIS which can be capitalized on and mapped to further scale up and deepen financial products and 
services such as saving, credit and insurance.  Translating these opportunities into reality requires 
strategic actions and steps as learned from the preceding strategy.  Therefore, this strategy, NFIS-II 
(2021-2025), is aiming to further advance financial inclusion through exploring new and looming 
opportunities and taking a strategic path in addressing the identified problems and challenges.   
In a nutshell, refreshing the existing strategy becomes necessary to chart new programs, actions as well 
as targets for the next five years (2021-2025) taking into account of shifts in the overall economic 
context – including greater digital capabilities, regulatory changes, strong private sector growth, and 
other socio-economic developments – that glow up new prospects to further advance financial inclusion 
in Ethiopia. Enhancing digital payments and agent-based financial services; driving financial inclusion in 
very rural and underserved areas; reducing the financial inclusion gender gap; driving sharia compliant 
financial products and services; and advancing financial education and consumers’ protection will be 
central to financial inclusion efforts going forward. 
3. Baseline 
In addition to the rationales discussed under sub-section 2 of this section, the vision and mission of the 
NFIS should and need to be clearly defined together with strategic priorities, actions and the 
implementation modalities based on experiences and best practices. The National Financial Inclusion 
Strategy (NFIS) 2016 had developed a comprehensive framework for defining interventions for financial 
inclusion. This framework remains in place, albeit with slight revisions. The revised framework that this 
Strategy leverages recognizes three fundamental types of interventions: 
 
consumer protection, capacity building and market interventions; 
 
financial infrastructure, including financial access points; and 
 
innovative products and services. 
 
                                                          
 
 
4 Kenya: FinAccess 2019; Rwanda: FinScope 2020 
 
xi  
 
In principle, dedicated actions for each type of specific 
financial service – payments, conventional and Sharia 
compliant savings, credit or insurance – within each of 
the three interventions of the framework are needed. 
For instance, actions on product innovation e.g. for 
credit, differ significantly from the actions needed in 
those pillars for improving access to payments services. 
The result can be visualized as a matrix (Figure 1).  
 
Actions defined within this Strategy cover each cell of 
this framework. However, prioritization is key for 
ensuring resources and efforts are channeled into 
those areas with the most urgent need for action and 
largest opportunity for impact. Thus, the vision, 
mission, specific strategic priorities have been defined 
within three specified approaches: Scale up, deepening and cross cutting enablers. Different programs 
have also been formulated each followed by specific actions as charted in the following sections.  
 
4. Vision, Mission Approach and Strategic Directions  
The primary steps in this strategy are to identify programs and actions which would bring high impact on 
financial inclusion in Ethiopia. In this regard, and under the inspiring vision, mission and strategic 
approaches, strategic priorities have been identified under interrelated three different approaches: 
scaling, deepening and cross cutting enables for financial inclusion.  As indicted in this section, for every 
priority actions, and under different programs, actions that run up to 7 have been mapped. 
 
4.1. Vision  and Mission 
 
Vision:  Financially inclusive Ethiopia 
 
Mission: Scale up and deepen financial inclusion to ensure 70% of adults are included by 2025.   
 
The Vision driving this strategy has been conceptually formulated to reflect three basic ideas: 
 
Universality: No Ethiopian adult should be left behind from financial inclusion; 
 
High-Quality: Suitable infrastructure and products & services designed to ensure informed 
financial decision-making, combined with financial education and financial consumer 
protection to improve every Ethiopian’s financial life; and 
 
Sustainability: Active transaction accounts with on-going usage through economically and 
socially sustainable scale up and deepening of the financial inclusion. 
 
Achieving this financial inclusion Vision will be a key enabler for sustainable development. Financial 
inclusion features as a target in eight of the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals5 and will serve as 
a foundational enabler and catalyst for four key national priorities:

agriculture; ensuring health and well-being; achieving gender equality and economic empowerment of women;

Make Ethiopia’s financial system more safe and sound by leveraging improved financial 
infrastructure, strengthened financial institutions, and thorough consumer protection to 
ensure confidence and expand the savings and deposit base in a responsible and sustainable 
way6 
 
Create jobs & drive economic growth by reducing barriers to accessing credit, especially for 
MSMEs, women, and low-income households, and leveraging innovative business models7 
 
Reduce poverty through increasing the economic resilience of low-income households via 
savings and insurance coverage and enabling them to fully participate in formal economic 
markets8 
 
Enhance capabilities for digital innovation with mobile money and other forms of digital 
finance, strong use cases, and training grounds for product innovation9 
 
4.2. Strategic Approach and  Directions 
The Mission for the next five years – 2021 to 2025 – thus is to scale up and deepen financial inclusion to 
ensure 70% of adults are included by 2025. This mission expresses a three-step approach to financial 
inclusion: 
 
4.2.1. Advancing Scale for Financial Inclusion   
Rapidly reaching scale in basic financial inclusion means converting as many financially-excluded people 
as possible – especially women and the rural poor – into first-time users of financial services. In practice, 
this will largely mean expanding mobile money and other transaction-enabling accounts as the most 
attractive entry point for financial inclusion with corresponding financial access points (often via agent 
networks). Special approaches are defined for extremely underserved, highly rural areas – where 
fundamental enablers such as mobile coverage and penetration, and electrification may be limited, and 
digital transaction-based financial inclusion is unlikely to work in the short term; other special 
approaches are also leveraged for women, who face unique and significant barriers to inclusion. Driving 
sharia compliant financial products and services would also be mapped to reap the evolving 
opportunities in this area. 
 
In prioritizing scale via mobile money and digital transactions, this Strategy incorporates learning’s from 
various countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.10 The path to financial inclusion that this Strategy 
charts also recognizes that learning’s from these countries, as well as advances over the past years, 
position Ethiopia well for rapidly scaling digital payments and mobile money, potentially leapfrogging 
intermediate phases.  
 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
 
promoting economic growth and jobs; supporting industry, innovation, and infrastructure; and reducing inequality.

6 This is a key element of the National Bank of Ethiopia’s Mission, see “Mission of the Bank” 
7 Leveraging past achievements for job creation and sustainable growth is a core national priority. The Homegrown 
Economic Reform Agenda lays out this goal 
8 The Government of Ethiopia has adopted poverty reduction as its number one Sustainable Development Goal, 
with the aim of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030, see Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Ethiopia 
9 “Digital Ethiopia 2025”, Ethiopia’s national strategy for achieving digital transformation at a national scale, 
recognizes financial inclusion as an important enabler 
10 Case studies provided in this document that support this finding include Ghana, Uganda, China, and India. See 
section 2.2 for details.  
 
xiii  
4.2.2. Deepening financial inclusion 
Initial scale of financial inclusion is reached primarily for (digital) transactions and mobile money. 
Deepening this means expanding the services that are accessible for newly-included population to cover 
productive credit, conventional and interest free saving and micro-insurance in addition to payments 
and accounts as basic stores of value. Gender-intentionality, a clear focus on the needs of the rural poor, 
and Sharia-compliant products and services across all Actions are integral elements to deepen financial 
inclusion as well. 
 
4.2.3. Advance Financial Education and Consumers Protection-Cross Cutting Enablers 
Due to lack of capability, most adults do not have trust and confidence to carry out transactions with 
formal financial institutions and heavily deponent on informal sector which is proved to be expensive, 
not efficient, sustainable and risky.  Approximately 50% of adults In Ethiopia also do not know how to 
open an account with regulated financial institutions. Curbing these long standing states require building 
the capability of adults and ensuring their trust and confidence in the financial institutions through a 
well-planned and coordinated programs charted under a defined approach, and mapped with specific 
actions and targets.   
 
This Strategy recognizes a range of existing national strategies and frameworks, crucially including 
Financial Consumers Protection Framework, the National Digital Payments Strategy (NDPS), the National 
Financial Education Strategy (NFES), and the Rural Financial Intermediation Program (RUFIP) III. Plan of 
actions developed here are carefully aligned with these and other relevant strategies, and 
implementation will be coordinated accordingly.  
 
4.3. Strategic Priorities and Programs 
4.3.1. Scaling financial inclusion 
Four strategic priorities for scaling financial inclusion (A1-A4) have been identified. First, digital financial 
inclusion – especially via mobile money and agent networks – will be a key priority going forward, and 
will be essential in unlocking not only urban, but most peri-urban and rural areas. Second, dedicated 
solutions will be developed for the most underserved, least developed parts of Ethiopia, likewise 
leveraging digital where possible. Third, financial inclusion for women will be prioritized, and a gender-
specific lens is incorporated into all major elements of this Strategy. This will intersect with the focus on 
digital and the most underserved areas to ensure that new digital approaches include a gender lens as 
an essential element.  A particular attention is paid to women in rural Ethiopia, who tend to be doubly 
disadvantaged. Fourth, a program has been charted to promoting sharia compliant financial products 
and services. 
 
Actions to achieve these four priorities have been defined and grouped into corresponding Programs. 
The Programs and individual Actions within them are designed to jointly reinforce each other and 
ensure truly inclusive basic financial services at scale across the country.  
 
Program A1: Drive digital payments by scaling mobile money 
Digital finance and mobile money at scale have been a key driver of financial inclusion across Africa and 
Asia, but are still at an emerging stage in Ethiopia, with a very limited number of agents and less than 
10% of adults using mobile money. Thus, driving non-cash payments with focus on digital finance and 
mobile money is a key priority, including dense agent networks built on the backbone of robust branch 
network coverage. 
 
Work in response to the NFIS 2016 has laid crucial regulatory foundations, including the Payment 
Instrument Issuers Directive and Use of Agents Directive. Actions defined by the National Digital 
 
xiv  
Payment Strategy will expand those foundations, in particular with respect to payments infrastructure, 
regulatory improvements and licensing of Payments Instrument Issuers. In addition, existing and 
planned improvements with respect to basic infrastructure – such as electricity, mobile coverage and 
penetration, and national ID – are crucial enablers. Taking into account these achievements and plans, 
this Program identify four priority actions and two initiatives: 
1. Enable sustainable digital payment agent network expansion by leveraging and supporting 
viable business cases;  
2. Roll out digital payment agency service for SACCOs and MFIs; 
3. Integrate and roll out digital payments (focused on mobile money) across priority G2P/P2G 
and social/humanitarian payments; 
4. Develop and implement targeted and responsible awareness creation campaign on mobile 
money and agent use; 
5. Expand payment schemes such as real time, national payment gateway, interoperability, 
and QR code (initiative); and 
6. Expand ATMs, POS devices and internet banking services (initiative). 
 
Program A2: Drive financial inclusion in underserved areas 
Challenges and opportunities for financial inclusion vary heavily with location-specific factors. Expanding 
financial inclusion in severely underserved areas poses a particular challenge due to fundamental 
disadvantages relating to wealth, infrastructure and economic activity. Unlocking the potential of 
financial inclusion to contribute to a broader uplift of such areas requires targeted solutions for financial 
inclusion at regional and woreda-level. Developing these solutions is another key priority.  
 
This Program therefore identifies six priority Actions: 
1. Expand “traditional” financial infrastructure11, especially bank and MFI branches, to cover 
severely underserved woredas as key enablers for agent networks and digital finance; 
2. Design and pilot dedicated financial access approach for low-readiness areas to improve 
economic viability, including dedicated capability building; 
3. Conduct studies to promote and expand traditional financial products and services that 
meets the needs of respective regions; 
4. Establish Regional Council for Financial Inclusion (RCFI);  
5. Establish Regional Financial Inclusion Task Forces and design and publish Financial Inclusion 
Framework. and 
6. Formulate and implement financial inclusion framework that is conducive and aligned to the 
circumstances of the regions  
 
Program A3: Drive financial inclusion for women 
The financial inclusion gender gap in Ethiopia has been growing over the past six years and now stands 
at 19 Percentage Points (up from 2PP in 2014). This is the second highest gender gap among 
benchmarked countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The development in Ethiopia as well as in benchmarked 
countries – with some countries’ gaps continuing to close, others continuing to grow – shows that 
Ethiopia’s gender gap is unlikely to be closed by generic actions aimed at financial inclusion. Gender-
intentional action (action designed specifically for reducing the existing gender gap, potentially including 
advocacy, regulatory interventions, policy design and more) therefore is a strategic priority. 
                                                          
 
 
11 Other programs such as DFS and financial education will be carried out in parallel under their own respective 
programs. 
 
xv  
 
To follow through on this priority, this Strategy takes gender intentionality as an overall focus, and 
specific actions and lenses are included throughout all Programs to ensure that all products, services, & 
channels (across savings, credit, and insurance), and general initiatives are designed with women in 
mind from the beginning. The overarching task of this Program, therefore, is to ensure and coordinate 
gender-intentional actions across all Programs and outside the NFIS, encompassing all efforts for scaling 
and deepening financial inclusion.  
 
In addition to this cross-cutting coordinating function, the Program identifies four priority Actions and 
three Initiatives: 
1. Establish a knowledge base on women’s unmet financial needs and barriers to financial 
inclusion;  
2. Launch women's account enrollment and educational outreach campaigns with a prioritized 
focus on youth, linking to NFES; 
3. Promote at least ¼ of the Senior Management (VP and Directors) of the financial institutions to 
be women, who will be mainly dedicated to promote women financial inclusion;  
4. Promote at least one woman to have a seat on the board of the financial institutions;  
5. Study and formulate a policy to encourage and motivate women financial inclusion, such as 
allowing increased saving interest rate  (Initiatives); 
6. Study and establish credit guarantee scheme dedicated to women financing (Initiatives); and   
7. Study and establish wholesale funding dedicated to women financing (to address liquidity issues 
of lending institutions, (Initiatives). 
 
Program A4: Drive Sharia compliant financial access points 
Expanding access points would create conducive environment to scale up sharia compliant financial 
transactions. Sharia compliant financial products and services providers i.e. Banks, Microfinance 
institutions, insurers and lease companies particularly those who stand with a full-fledged status will be 
coordinated to expand their branch outlets around feasible areas especially where Muslim community 
dominates. In view of these, the following three priority actions under this program have been 
formulated:  
 
1. Enhance ecosystem for Sharia-compliant financial access points and digital financial services by 
conducting a study, and designing interventions to drive scale; 
2. Expand branches of financial institutions as an access point for sharia complaint products and 
services; and  
3. Promote Sharia-compliant transaction accounts. 
 
4.3.2. Deepening Financial Inclusion  
Five strategic priorities for deepening financial inclusion have been identified. One of the Programs (B0) 
aims at creating the necessary foundations that will be carried out in parallel with efforts to scale 
(Program A1-A4). The Programs corresponding to the other five priorities focus on achieving product-
specific deepening and will be executed as planned under Programs B0,  B1, B2, B3 and B4. 
 
Program B0: Lay foundations for deepening of innovative financial services and create momentum- 
Conventional and Sharia Compliant 
Compared with payments, financial inclusion with respect to both conventional and sharia compliant- 
credits, and insurance in Ethiopia are currently at a relatively lower level of maturity. As described 
previously, this is generally in line with development sequences in other countries in Africa and Asia. 
Enabling this progression from the first Stage of scaling basic (payments-focused) financial inclusion to 
 
xvi  
the second Stage of deepening to savings, credit and insurance requires significant preparatory work. In 
addition, leveraging existing products and services, initial momentum for greater deepening must be 
generated immediately, including by continued outreach and awareness-raising. Thus, completing these 
deepening preparations in parallel with efforts directed at scaling payments-focused financial inclusion 
is a strategic priority.  
The corresponding Program identifies four priority Actions: 
1. Enhance and consolidate the regulatory and supporting environment for financial services 
beyond payments to facilitate digital channels and innovative offerings;  
2. Enhance savings and pension ecosystem and offerings with focus on innovative products and 
mobilization outreach; 
3. Enhance productive credit ecosystem and offerings through credit information and movable 
asset-based lending; and 
4. Enhance micro-insurance ecosystem and offerings via business case and index data 
infrastructure. 
 
 Program B1: Deepen formal savings  
Ubiquitous formal savings are important in their own right – serving to make people’s lives safer and 
more stable by building household assets, smoothing consumption, and protecting families from 
emergencies. Moreover, savings expansion is a prerequisite for credit expansion via increased liquidity 
of the financial system . While ~62% of Ethiopians report having saved in some form in the past year, 
only ~30% have saved with a formal financial institution. Thus, there is significant room for shifting 
savings into the formal sector, thereby increasing benefits for savers and liquidity in the financial 
system.  
 
The corresponding Program identifies four priority Actions and one Initiative: 
1. Promote digital savings; 
2. Carry out studies to introduce private pension scheme particularly for low income people; 
3. Expand traditional financial savings; 
4. Promote all G2p and P2G  payments12 to be made through bank and MFIs accounts; and 
5. Work on members of cooperatives, Edir, community saving (Equb), Community health insurance 
scheme and others to promote account opening and savings with financial institutions 
(initiative). 
 
Program B2: Expand access to credit  
Although Ethiopia’s total credit volumes to the private sector have grown significantly over the past 
years (+28% annually between 2016 and 202013), MSMEs, the agricultural sector, and lower-income 
households have not benefitted proportionally, with limited access to credit being a major barrier to 
growth for the majority of MSMEs.14 Making financing more widely available - while ensuring consumer 
protection and sufficient literacy - for these key excluded segments is therefore a strategic priority 
within the effort to deepen financial inclusion. 
 
The corresponding Program identifies three priority Actions and two Initiatives:

xvii  
1. Increase financing options for the “Missing Middle” (integration with RUFIP III and other 
strategies); 
2. Promote responsible digital micro-credit products with appropriate guardrails; 
3. Promote movable assets as collateral for loan; 
4. Study to increase financing  options for cooperatives (initiative); and 
5. Study to increase financing options for households (initiative) 
 
Program B3: Develop a strong micro-insurance system 
Similar to savings, microinsurance is an important contributor to making people’s lives safer and more 
stable, and is also often a precondition for access to credit, namely via insured collateral. Insurance 
coverage has been growing over the past years, but still remains relatively low at ~7% of adults holding 
some form of insurance. Furthermore, the insurance market for the agricultural sector and MSMEs is 
very nascent despite the high risks faced by enterprises in these critical segments. Thus, increasing 
insurance coverage against major risks, especially for low-income households (life, health, etc.) plus the 
agricultural sector and MSMEs is a strategic priority. 
 
The corresponding Program identifies four priority Actions and one Initiative: 
1. Scale national agricultural insurance (integration with MOA strategy and RUFIP III);  
2. Promote market entry and innovation in micro-insurance, including via InsurTech; 
3. Promote insurance for movable assets that serve as collateral for loan;  
4. Expand and strengthen access and distribution channels for microinsurance; and 
5. Link Edir to the formal financial system (initiative). 
 
Program B4: Drive Sharia compliant financial products and services 
Sharia compliant savings, financing, takaful and pension mobilization have been limited due to 
ineffectiveness of products, channels, and approaches to draw short and long-term savings from 
emerging businesses and low-income populations. Sharia compliant finance has its own products, 
services and contracts that differ from convention financial products and services.  Some of these 
include Mudharabah (profit sharing), Wadiah (Safekeeping), Musharakah (Joint venture), Murababab 
Cost & fianance), Ijar (Leasing), Hawala (an international fund transfer system), takaful (Islamic 
Insurance), and sukuk (Islamic bonds)15.      
 
As emerging products and services and to deepen financial inclusion of adults who have been excluded 
due to religious reasons, the following four priority actions under this program have been mapped:  
1. Enhance ecosystem for Sharia-compliant financial products and services by conducting a 
detailed study, and designing interventions to drive product availability and adoption; 
2. Promote Sharia-compliant savings; 
3. Promote Sharia-compliant financing and responsible digital micro-credit, with appropriate 
guardrails; and 
4. Promote micro takaful (Islamic insurance).  
 
4.3.3. Cross cutting enabler – Improve Conventional and Sharia Compliant Consumers 
Protection and Financial Education

Program C1: Advance financial education and consumers’ protection- Conventional and Sharia 
Compliant 
This program is formulated to promote financial education, conventional and sharia compliant, and 
consumers’ protection and guided by the National Financial Education Strategy (NFES), Financial 
Consumers Protection framework and Directive that are recently approved by the Board of the National 
Bank of Ethiopia.   
 
The Program identifies five priority enabling Actions: 
1. Create awareness and educate adults on account opening and saving, financing options, digital 
payments, microinsurance, use of agents and others; 
2. Enhance financial literacy for regions, especially for low readiness areas,  to expand outreach 
and promote account enrollment and deepening; 
3. Launch special financial education interventions for women, edir etc. to expand the outreach 
and promote account enrollment  and deepening;  
4. Promote conventional and Sharia complaint financial education; and 
5. Apply conventional and sharia compliant financial consumers’ protection including digital 
financial services. 
 
5. Targets and Indicators 
Financial inclusion targets and indicators are crucial for tracking and communicating overall progress 
against clearly defined goals, understanding the impact of specific actions, and identifying unexpected 
challenges, opportunities, novel trends, or diverging developments. This Strategy follows a three-tiered 
approach for target and indicators definition under the demand and supply side (overall target, Head 
line targets and supporting targets) as indicted below: 
 
5.1. Demand Side Targets and Indicators 
5.1.1. Demand Side - Overall Target 
Increase the proportion of adults who own a formal financial account from 45% (2020) to 70% by 2025.  
 
5.1.2. Headline Targets 
For each of the programs of this strategy16 , demand side headline targets have been formulated as 
follows፡ 
 
Drive digital payments by scaling mobile money: Increase digital payments usage rate from 
20% of all adults (2020) to 49% by 2025; 
 
Drive financial inclusion in underserved areas:  Halve the gap in account ownership between 
the Emerging Regions average and the national level by 202517; 
 
Drive financial inclusion for women: Halve the gender gap in account ownership from its 
current estimated 19PP (2020) to 10PP by 2025, stopping it from growing by 2023 latest, while 
maintaining the current near-equal account usage rates; 
 
Drive sharia compliant financial products and services: Increase the scale of sharia compliant 
account ownership from the current 12% to 18% by 2025. 
 
Maximize savings mobilization: Increase percentage of adults who report using formal savings 
from 30% (2020) to 40% by 2025; and 
                                                          
 
 
16 Note that no quantitative targets are set for the foundational Program B0 and the Key Strategic Enabler for data 
collection and analysis  
17 This target will be reviewed and specified by the Emerging Regions & Underserved Areas Task Force 
 
xix  
 
Develop a strong micro-insurance system: Increase the number of smallholder crop and 
livestock farmers formally insured from the current level18 in 2020 to 500K by 2025; 
 
Increase awareness of adults on financial products and services to 75% in 2025 from 47% in 
2019 
 
5.1.3. Supporting Targets 
The headline targets are complemented with supporting and additional supply-side quantitative targets 
and indicators that help evaluate the impact of individual Actions. Indicators are defined for Actions 
where quantitative, Action-specific impact data is likely to be available. This would help evaluate the 
impact of individual actions; also, a larger number of additional monitoring indicators, including splits 
by region, gender, age and others, is tracked regularly. These indicators serve as a basis for designing 
interventions and understanding root causes in new developments and as an early-warning system for 
unexpected developments (See Appendix 2 for the detail). 
 
 
5.2. Supply Side Targets and Indictors 
5.2.1. Overall Supply Side Target 
Increase transaction accounts per 100 adults to 337 by the end of 2025 from what it was 159 in 2020 
 
5.2.2. Supply side Headline Targets 
Supply side headline targets have been formulated for each of the programs of this strategy 19 as listed 
below: 
 
Increase digital accounts per 100 adults to 120 by the end of 2025 from what it was 25 in 2020; 
 
Reduce the transaction  account  gap of regions to half by 2025 from the national average;  
 
Increase transaction account  per 100 women to 135  by 2025 from what it was 49 in 2020; 
 
Increase saving accounts per 100 adults to 217 by the end of 2025 from what it was 134 in 
2020; 
 
Increase MSMEs access to credit to 10% of the private sector loan by 2025 from what it was 5% 
in 2020; 
 
 Increase the number of micro insurance policies to 500,000 by the end of 2025; 
 
Increase sharia compliant transaction a accounts to 10 million from 5.4 million in 2020; and  
 
Increase the number of adults by 10 million in 2025 who are aware of financial products and 
services.  
 
5.2.3. Supporting Targets 
Similar to the demand side targets and indicators, the headline targets for the supply side are 
complemented with supporting and additional quantitative targets and indicators that help evaluate 
the impact of individual Actions. Indicators are defined for Actions where quantitative, Action-
specific impact data is likely to be available (See Appendix 2 for the detail) 
 
6. Governance Structure  
Building on the structure established with the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) 2016, the 
governance structure for this Strategy will have several fundamental elements: 
                                                          
 
 
18 To be determined based on the baseline 
19 Note that no quantitative targets are set for the foundational Program B0 and the Key Strategic Enabler for data 
collection and analysis  
 
xx  
 
 
The National Council for Financial Inclusion (NCFI), as the main decision-making body 
accountable to the Office of the Prime Minister for financial inclusion progress in Ethiopia. 
 
The Financial Inclusion Steering Committee (FISC) plays an advisory role, links lead institutions 
they are repressing and follow up the roles and responsibilities given to it and each of the lead 
institutions. 
 
Regional Council for Financial Inclusion (RCFI), as decision making body with respect to the 
financial inclusion affairs of the region, in consultation with the NCFI and FIS, will be 
accountable to the NCFI.   
 
Regional Financial Inclusion Task Force: Full time workers that is bestowed with the 
implementation of the regional financial inclusion activities in consultation with FIS and under 
the guidance of the RCFI. 
 
The Financial Inclusion Secretariat (FIS) bestowed with the central project management role 
through coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the entire progress of the implementation 
of the strategy. Although housed in and hosted by the NBE, FIS will be accountable and report 
directly to the NCFI. 
 
Program Coordinators and Implementers: Lead program coordinators and implementers, 
together with working groups, under each of the programs will be assigned under FIS.  The 
overall coordination, monitoring and evaluation process will also be be carried out by the M&E 
Expert.

This proposed governance structure leverages the strengths of the previous structure and addresses 
identified areas for improvement. Five important changes are incorporated: 
 
Expanded project management capacity by allowing the Financial Inclusion Secretariat (FIS) 
mainly to focus on financial inclusion coordination rather than direct implementation, and by 
capability-building for FIS staff. This will enable the FIS to effectively hold organizations 
accountable, monitor results, flag implementation challenges, and coordinate across 
stakeholders.  
 
More effective and targeted decision-making by strengthening active advisory role for the 
Steering Committee and Program-level implementation teams (with leadership representation) 
to ensure decision making and guidance at a Program level.  
 
Intensified involvement of, and coordination with, financial inclusion ecosystem by 
re-establishing Implementation Groups for each priority Program and expanding their role and 
standing by increasing meeting frequency, ensuring members have decision-making authority 
with home institutions, and establishing direct line of communication with Program 
coordination teams at FIS.  
 
Expand regional representation by establishing Regional Council for Financial Inclusion and a 
Regional Taskforce that will be fully engaged in the implantation of the financial inclusion 
actions defined to the region by this strategy.  
 
Working Groups /Implementation task force will be formed to implement each program under 
the leadership of program coordinators with in FIS.  Special Implementation Task Forces are 
also formed given the greater scope of the actions needed under driving financial inclusions for 
regional lens Programs. 
 
7. Granular Implementation Action Plan; Monitoring and Evaluation and Risk Mitigation  Framework 
7.1. Granular Implementation Action Plan 
The Implementation plan for this Strategy is designed in accordance with best practices, and lessons 
learned from the implementation of the NFIS 2016. Accordingly, five key principles are leveraged to 
design an effective and efficient implementation plan that ensures successful achievement of intended 
targets. Collectively, these principles inform the design of the implementation plan for this Strategy:  
1. Specific and measurable: Actions and activities are clearly defined, with specific deliverables 
& concrete outputs marking completion and enabling effective progress measurement  
2. Achievable and result oriented: Actions within this Strategy are designed to achieve clearly 
articulated results. Action-level targets are developed considering experience and speed of 
progress in comparable countries, and are aligned with the overall and program-level targets  
3. Time bound: all Actions, activities, outputs and targets within this Strategy are mapped onto a 
single timeline, which accounts for interdependencies & priorities across the programs.  
4. Systematic: efficient and purpose driven implementation is enabled by program-based 
approach in this Strategy, where action level interdependencies are mapped, and 
implementation is focused  
5. Agile: overall implementation and governance structure is clear. It includes systematic 
processes for speedy identification of problems, clear triggers for escalation, and effective 
adjustment to changes, without disrupting workflow  
 
A separate implementation plan document accompanying this Strategy, covering granular details, 
expands on the implementation planning with the following:  
 
Detailed governance structure charters with roles, responsibilities, and engagement models to 
ensure effective coordination for implementation; 
 
xxii  
 
Implementation plan detailing objectives, activities and output at Action, Program and overall 
Strategy level to provide a systematic guide for implementation; 
 
A monitoring and evaluation framework with a clear and structured set of tracking, reporting 
and escalation measures to ensure effective progress mapping during implementation; 
 
Detailed list of risks and potential mitigation measures at Action and overall Strategy level to 
help navigate potential bottlenecks during implementation; and 
 
Finally, a set of key steps to guide kick-off for implementation of the overall Strategy. 
 
Overall, 200+ granular actions have been identified under each of the Programs.  The full breadth of 
these actions will be implemented over a 5 year horizon, 2021-2025. Implementation of the actions of 
five20 of the eight programs will be commenced in first quarter of 2021. Building on these, the actions of 
three of the remaining programs21 will be started in parallel.   
 
7.2. 
Monitoring and Evaluation Framework 
The robust monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system detailed in this Strategy will track strategy 
progress, identify obstacles in Strategy implementation and demonstrate the results of financial 
inclusion efforts in Ethiopia. The M&E system is comprised of three main elements:  
 
7.2.1. Enhance data collection and analytics 
Across all Programs, reliable, widely trusted, sufficiently fine-grained and regularly refreshed data on the 
state of financial inclusion in Ethiopia is essential for understanding and communicating financial 
inclusion progress, identifying barriers, designing interventions, and assessing the impact of efforts 
made. This Strategy thus defines an additional Program for expanding financial inclusion data 
capabilities. This Program identifies three priority Actions: 
1. Improve supply-side data collection by including demographic (including gender-disaggregated) 
and geospatial breakdowns  
2. Define and implement integrated analytical framework for demand-side data and optimize  
collection  
3. Create and maintain a central Financial Inclusion Database 
 
7.2.2. Implementation Tracking Framework:  
 
Execution tracking will assess if implementation is on course to complete all actions & 
activities as planned, and if all scheduled outputs are available 
 
Impact target tracking will compare progression towards quantitative targets against 
interim milestones, and gauge the impact of strategic actions on Financial Inclusion. 
 
7.2.3. Reporting and Escalation Measures22 
 
A regular reporting mechanism will provide consistent progress updates against targets 
& KPIs, with focus on new risks and opportunities 
                                                          
 
 
20 Key Strategic Enabler Program; and Programs, A1, A2, A3 and B0  
21 Programs B1, B2 and B3 
22 Note: the reporting and escalation measures provided here are indicative and will be finalized with 
key stakeholders after approval of the NFIS 2020. 
 
 
xxiii  
 
Escalation measures will provide an avenue for exception-based reporting; when 
defined targets are not reached, or might not be reached, to ensure mitigation efforts 
are carried out in time to resume implementation of the NFIS as planned.  
 
7.3. 
Mid-term Review 
To ensure effective adaptation to a fast changing and dynamic ecosystem, a mid-term review of this 
Strategy will be conducted, including assessment of implementation progresses against targets, outputs, 
potential unforeseen consequences and emerging risks and opportunities.  
 
7.4. 
Risk and Mitigation Framework  
The effective implementation of the NFIS 2020 will require adequate planning for potential risks and 
developing mitigation measures accordingly. Each of the programs and the actions within this Strategy 
have specific risks and mitigation measures that have been mapped at the action level. These risks and 
mitigation measures are detailed in the Implementation Plan document that accompanies this Strategy.

2. BASELINE 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
 
 
1  
1. Background 
1.1. Introduction 
 
Financial inclusion is a national priority for Ethiopia and a long-standing focus area for the GoE. The 
development of Ethiopia’s first National Financial Inclusion Strategy in 2016 was a historic milestone 
for these efforts, achieving ground-breaking regulatory and financial infrastructure improvements and 
a doubling of financial inclusion levels. The implementation period for the first strategy ended in 
2020. With this refresh of Ethiopia’s National Financial Inclusion Strategy in 2020, the NBE builds on 
these achievements and re-affirms its commitment to drive national financial inclusion efforts and 
coordinate implementation across the public and private sector.23 
 
Full financial inclusion ensures that individuals and businesses have access to, and make use of, 
affordable financial products and services – including transactions, payments, savings, credit, and 
insurance – that meet their needs in a responsible and sustainable way.  
 
This refreshed Strategy for financial inclusion in Ethiopia assesses the status quo of financial inclusion, 
analyzes new opportunities and challenges, and defines revisions for expanding financial inclusion over 
the next five years (2021-2025), subject to a mid-term review to accommodate the fast changing 
dynamism in the financial inclusion ecosystem. 
 
The refreshed Strategy also reflects identified contextual changes and incorporates learning’s from the 
implementation of the first strategy. In particular, a detailed review of the first strategy and actions 
undertaken has yielded the following focus areas going forward: 
 
Consistent prioritization across actions, quantitative indicators, and target ambition levels is 
key for channeling multi-stakeholder efforts at national and regional levels; 
 
More focus is needed on six key areas going forward: (1) Digital financial services, especially 
mobile money as a key opportunity; (2) Financial inclusion in very rural, underserved areas via 
location-specific efforts; (3) Financial inclusion for women via gender-intentional Actions; (4) 
Driving Sharia compliant products and services; and (5) Deepening of the levels of financial 
inclusion with respect to both conventional and sharia compliant savings, productive credit, 
and micro-insurance; and (6) build trust and confidence of the public through financial 
education. 
 
Emphasis on sustainability and economic viability is needed – enabling viable business models 
for financial service provision beyond urban centers, while also advancing financial education 
and ensuring sustainability with robust consumer protection as cross cutting enablers; 
 
Pre-alignment and cross-institutional collaboration needs to be expanded, given past 
experiences and the implementation-heavy tasks going forward. 
In designing Actions for these focus areas, this Strategy also takes into account experiences and lessons 
learned from other countries.  This, together with advances made over the past years, will allow Ethiopia 
to leapfrog intermediary development stages and avoid technological, regulatory or policy dead ends. 
 
                                                          
 
 
23 This National Financial Inclusion Strategy refresh was done with the support of several key stakeholders, 
including ministries, federal agencies, private sector institutions and associations, and international partners. 
 
2  
1.2. Rationale for the formulation of NFIS-II 
The main reasons for refreshing the National Financial Inclusion Strategy-II (NFIS) are summarized here 
below: 
 
First, the rise of new opportunities and enablers within the financial sector:  With the existing National 
Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS), Ethiopia strengthened its commitment to financial inclusion as a 
strategic priority – across ministries, other government institutions, and the private sector. Partly 
through the implementation of the actions of this strategy, significant progresses and changes that can 
serve as fundamental enablers to further expanding financial inclusion have been made since then. 
Remarkable achievements include: 
 
Amendment of Banking Business Proclamation that, among others, permits the establishment 
of full-fledged interest free banks; 
 
Amendment of Insurance Business Proclamation that, among others, permits the establishment 
of full-fledged microinsurance companies and takaful; 
 
Issuance of a new proclamation to provide for Movable Property Security Right;  
 
New and amendment directives24 on agent banking; financial institution branch opening; 
Payments Operators and Issuers’ Licensing; Financial Consumer Protection; Operationalization 
of Movable Collateral Registry; Codification, Valuation and Registration of Movable Properties 
as Collateral; 
 
Issuance of National Financial Education Strategy; 
 
Formulation of  National Digital Retail Payment Strategy ( in the process of ratification);   
 
The creation of central electronics system for Movable Collateral Registry when collateralized;  
 
Enhancement of the Credit Reference Bureau; and 
 
Extension of Rural Financial Intermediation Program (RUFIP) III.  
 
These enablers for financial inclusion were not in existence during the formulation of the 2016 strategy. 
This has created major restraint on the progress of financial inclusion and lots of opportunities were 
lost.  On the other hand, the reform efforts have significantly changed the financial ecosystem and can 
be charted to further stimulate and advance financial inclusion, as having direct impact and vast 
opportunities for the upcoming strategic period.  
 
Second, Homegrown Economic Reform Agenda: New and conducive socio-economic environments that 
broadly provide with opportunities to further scale up and deepen financial inclusion have been evolving 
ensuing the Homegrown Economic Reform Agenda (HGER):  National Digital Transformation Strategy, 
“Digital Ethiopia 2025”; Plan of Action for Job Creation; Ministry of Agriculture ten-year plan; to 
partially privatize Ethio-telecom; National Gender Strategy; Initiative taken for National ID, among 
others, can be cited. Aligning the financial inclusion efforts with these evolving opportunities drives it to 
a greater advancement.    
  
Third, completion of most of the actions of the 2016 Strategy: The implementation period for the first 
National Financial Inclusion Strategy (developed in 2016) ended in 2020. This Strategy had mapped a 
comprehensive and interrelated framework for defining interventions to advance financial inclusion in

Ethiopia: a) Build financial infrastructure; b) Expand innovative products and services; c) Advance 
financial consumer protection; and d) Promote financial education.   Through the execution efforts, 
around 80% of the total 49 actions of the strategy, charted under the stated interventions, have been 
completed and produced strong results, with several targets exceeded. More specifically, the major 
achievements, besides those highlighted above, include:    
 
The number of transaction accounts per 100 adults grew by a factor of ~2.4 and now averages 
159 transaction accounts per 100 adults, compared to a 2015 baseline of 68.  
 
Ethiopia has made significant progress in the last six years and increased the financially included 
adults by more than double i.e. from 22% in 2014 to ~45% in 2020; 
 
Bank branches grew ~1.7, from seven to twelve branches per 100,000 adults, outperforming 
the initial target of 8.8 per 100,000 adults;  
 
Agent network has grown significantly in the last four years. In 2016, banking and mobile 
money agents were almost non-existent, with a baseline of three per 100,000 adults. This has 
increased by a factor of over 25 and reached to 77 agents per 100,000 adults as of 2020;  
 
Digital finance footprint has increased substantially over the past four years with debit cards 
growing by a factor of four; over 9 million mobile banking transactions; and 1.4 million online 
banking transactions;   
 
In 2016, mobile money was extremely limited, with mobile money wallets making up less than 
1% of transaction accounts. Since then, mobile money accounts have increased by a factor of 
10, with ~8 million mobile money wallets registered as of June 2020; 
 
The percentage of Ethiopians reporting saving in formal institutions has risen steeply from 14% 
to ~30% of people in the past six years; and 
 
The percentage of adults reporting having a loan at a regulated financial institution rising 
slightly to 11% from a baseline of 10%. 
 
This Refreshed National Financial Inclusion Strategy 2020, therefore, aimed at building on the success of 
the first Strategy, and leverages new opportunities to chart a path for the next 5 years (2021-2025).  
 
Forth, aspiration to further advance financial inclusion: Although Ethiopia has been advancing by more 
than double in the past five years,  the level of  financial inclusion compared with benchmarked 
counties, however, indicates that Ethiopia has scale and vast opportunities to grow across several 
indicators.  Building on these successes and capitalizing on new and emerging opportunities, Ethiopia 
can further advance the level of financial inclusion and can follow the foot-steps of regional peers e.g. 
83% for Kenya and 77% for Rwanda25; compared to ~45% for Ethiopia.  
Fifth, lack of focus on severely underserved regions and areas; widening gap between men and women 
financial inclusion; low level of development and expansion of digital financial services including mobile 
money; and under developed sharia compliant financial products and services have been identified as 
the main and forefront challenges that negatively impact further advancement of financial inclusion in 
Ethiopia. In addition, new opportunities have been emerging following the implementation of the first 
NFIS which can be capitalized on and mapped to further scale up and deepen financial products and 
services such as saving, credit and insurance.  Translating these opportunities into reality requires 
strategic actions and steps as learned from the preceding strategy.  Therefore, this strategy, NFIS-II 
(2021-2025), is aiming to further advance financial inclusion through exploring new and looming 
opportunities and taking a strategic path in addressing the identified problems and challenges.

4  
In a nutshell, refreshing the existing strategy becomes necessary to chart new programs, actions as well 
as targets for the next five years (2021-2025) taking into account of shifts in the overall economic 
context – including greater digital capabilities, regulatory changes, strong private sector growth, and 
other socio-economic developments – that glow up new prospects to further advance financial inclusion 
in Ethiopia. Enhancing digital payments and agent-based financial services; driving financial inclusion in 
very rural and underserved areas; reducing the financial inclusion gender gap; driving sharia compliant 
financial products and services; and advancing financial education and consumers’ protection will be 
central to financial inclusion efforts going forward. 
The document is divided into seven main sections. The first section looks at the overall baseline state of 
financial inclusion in Ethiopia, assessing strengths and areas for development. Based on the findings, the 
following section lays out the Vision, Mission, and Approaches for achieving the needed step-change in 
financial inclusion, culminating in the definition of priority Programs corresponding to the defined 
strategic priorities. The third section details the Programs and Actions designed to achieve the overall 
vision, while section four defines specific Targets corresponding to these Programs. The fifth section 
details implementation actions followed by the Governance Structure.  Section seven lays down the 
monitoring and evaluation framework and risk and possible mitigation steps.  Finally, greater detail is 
available on the Programs, Actions, and Targets in the appendix, and a separate financial inclusion 
Implementation Framework document complements this with detailed implementation timelines and 
responsibilities.

2. Baseline 
With the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) 2016, Ethiopia identified financial inclusion as a 
strategic priority – across ministries, other government institutions, and private sector initiatives. The 
actions defined in that strategy encompass various types of efforts, including on financial and other 
infrastructure, financial products and services, financial consumer protection, and financial capabilities 
and education. Jointly, these actions have aimed for expansion of financial inclusion across all core 
dimensions, including payments, savings, credit and insurance. Landmark achievements include new 
directives26 on agent banking, financial institution branch opening and payments operators and issuers 
licensing as well as on Financial Consumer Protection; the enhancement of the Credit Reference Bureau 
and creation of a Movable Collateral Registry; and the creation of a National Financial Education 
Strategy. 
 
Figure 3: Country comparison in transaction accounts, credit, and access points. 
Sources: NBE supply-side data, IMF Financial Access survey, Financial Inclusion Insights and country specific data sets 
These and other major financial inclusion efforts have already produced strong results, with several 
targets exceeded. Compared to benchmark counties, however, Ethiopia has opportunities to grow 
across several financial inclusion indicators (see Figure 3). 
More specifically, six patterns can be identified when comparing Ethiopia’s financial inclusion progress 
to the 2016 starting point, the ambitions set in the NFIS 2016, and international developments.  These 
trends are described in detail in the following pages (Sub-Section 2.1-2.9).  
For international comparisons, a basket of benchmark countries have been selected based on data 
availability, comparable level of wealth (low income countries to lower-middle income countries) and 
infrastructure development, active policy focus on financial inclusion and potential for lessons learned 
(including a clearly defined Financial Inclusion Strategy, Framework, or similar foundations). This basket 
includes the following countries: Tanzania, Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Kenya, Rwanda, Pakistan, Indonesia, 
Bangladesh, India and South Africa. Note that individual indicators may only show a subset of these 
countries due to changing data availability per indicator.

2.1. Overall Financial Inclusion Progress  
Significant improvements registered on Financial Inclusion since 2016: Owning a 
transaction account - including deposit accounts (current and savings accounts), credit accounts, and 
mobile money wallets - is regarded as the basic form of financial inclusion. Transaction account 
ownership is, therefore, regarded as the minimum criterion of being financially included. In this regard, 
Ethiopia has made significant progress in the last six years, more than doubling the proportion of the 
population that is financially included. 
More specifically, transaction accounts (including accounts from both financial institutions and mobile 
money wallets) have increased across various indicators. In particular, the number of transaction 
accounts per 100 adults grew by a factor of ~2.4 and now averages 159 transaction accounts per 100 
adults, compared to a 2015 baseline of 68.27 
While part of this effect is likely to be driven by additional account openings from individuals who 
already possessed one28, it is estimated that the increase has nonetheless led to a doubling of 
individuals with (at least) one bank account, from 22% in 2014 to ~45% in 2020.   
Additionally, both demand and supply-side data indicates that there are opportunities to improve. On 
the supply-side, Ethiopia reports 159 transaction accounts per 100 adults compared to the international 
benchmark median of ~230 accounts (Figure 4); while on the demand-side, Ethiopia has ~45% of adults 
reporting formal account ownership compared to the median of 64% (Figure 5).

27 The definition of transaction accounts in this Strategy includes mobile money wallets. In the NFIS 2016 strategy, 
mobile money wallets were not included in the definition and were not tracked either. Since then, different mobile 
money programs have been rolled out and the NBE now actively tracks the indicator. The figures quoted in this 
Strategy include mobile money wallets. 
28 Based on a comparison of demand and supply-side data, this report estimates that approximately 30% of 
accounts opened after 2017 are owned by individuals that did not possess an account in 2015, and the remaining 
70% of newly-opened accounts are opened by individuals who did already possess one.

2.2. Access points: Strong in Branch Network Expansion, with a Nascent Agent Network 
Over the past five years, traditional financial access points have expanded significantly in Ethiopia. Bank 
branches grew ~1.7, from seven to twelve branches per 100,000 adults, outperforming both the initial 
target and the average of benchmarked countries at 10 branches per 100,000 adults. 
Ethiopia’s budding agent network has grown significantly in the last four years. In 2016, banking and 
mobile money agents were almost non-existent, with a baseline of three per 100,000 adults. This has 
increased by a factor of over 25, to 77 agents per 100,000 adults as of 2020. Given this rate of growth, it 
can quickly catch up to Sub-Saharan Africa’s leaders in agent networks, which currently exceed 
Ethiopia’s network by at least one order of magnitude (Figure 6). This is due to the ubiquity of mobile 
money in international benchmark countries that has seen an unprecedented growth in agent networks, 
with a median of about 1,000 agents per 100,000 adults.  
This divergence in agent networks - which provide the vast majority of access points - results in the 
divergence in proximity to financial access points, with a benchmark median of 84% of adults reporting 
living within 5km of an access point in comparison to Ethiopia’s 41% (Figure 7).

2.3. Digital Finance and Mobile Money: Significant Progress, and Opportunity to Grow Further  
Ethiopia’s digital finance footprint has increased substantially over the past four years with debit cards 
growing by a factor of four; over 9 million mobile banking transactions; and 1.4 million online banking 
transactions.  However, it still underperforms benchmark countries. 
In 2016, mobile money was extremely limited, with mobile money wallets making up less than 1% of 
transaction accounts. Since then, mobile money accounts have increased by a factor of 10, with ~8 
million mobile money wallets registered as of June 2020. 
Continuing with this pace of growth, Ethiopia can follow the foot-steps of regional peers who have 
reached larger proportion of mobile money accounts (37%-67% in benchmark countries).

2.4. Gender: The Gender Gap is Large and 
Widening Across the Board 
The gender gap in financial inclusion has been 
widening over the past eight years in Ethiopia. In 
2014, it stood at a negligible 2 Percentage Points 
(23% vs. 21%); in 2017 at 12 percentage points 
(41% vs. 29%). Based on other data, it is now 
projected to stand at 19 percentage points (53% 
vs. 34%)29. Ethiopia now has the second-largest 
gender gap among seven benchmarked countries 
in Sub-Saharan Africa. In effect, while the 
absolute level of financial inclusion has increased 
for both men and women, more need be done to benefit men and women equally.

The specific reasons for this rise in the gender gap 
are not known in detail, and will require further 
study (Refer to Program A3 of this Strategy). 
Nonetheless, three likely reasons have an impact 
on the increasing gender gap: 
 
Existing gaps in fundamental enablers 
such as education and income levels.30 
Overall financial inclusion has grown 
significantly since 2014. However, as 
financial incluison levels increased, the 
impact of the underlying gaps was still 
present, with a consequential increase in 
the financial inclusion gender gap.  
 
Limited gender intentionality in financial 
inclusion 
policy 
and 
strategy 
implementation, which accelerated the 
gender gap trend.31 
 
Limited benefit (versus other countries) 
from the equalizing effects of digital 
finance and mobile money due to the 
historically bank-branch led approach.32 
 
2.5. Geographic Divergences in Financial Inclusion 
Financial inclusion levels vary between urban and rural areas (Figure 14). This is because financial 
products and services are traditionally more relevant in geographies that are highly urbanized, with 
dense populations. 
Additionally, there is performance divergence across regions, with account ownership at 75% in Addis 
Ababa and 6% in Somali as per Figure 15. While this is partially explained by different levels of urban 
development (Figure 14), the lowest performing region still remains below the rural average, indicating 
that there are more consequential factors at play than the rural nature of the regions.33 
Finally, there also exist divergences at woreda level as well. For instance, more than 37% of woredas do 
not have a bank branch according to the Ethiopia Geospatial report (Figure 13).  
                                                          
 
 
30 The gender gap sub-ranking for economic equality is based on female labor participation force, wage equality, 
overall income earned, percentage of women in senior positions and percentage of women who are professional 
and technical workers.  
31 International benchmarks indicate that, for countries that are gender intentional (e.g. India, Ghana and 
Tanzania) in strategy design, and implementation, the gender gap decreases considerably 
32 This did not circumvent or mitigate key barriers women face traditionally in accessing the formal financial 
system 
33 This is observed across other indicators, such as access points, savings, and credit.

While some of this divergence may be explained by variation in population density between woredas, 
86% of woredas still remain below the national average bank density per 100,000 adults. This indicates 
that disparity in access point coverage is present even when controlling for the effects of population.34 
2.6. Opportunities to Promote Sharia Compliant Financial Products and Services 
Following legal reforms, full-fledged interest free banking and takaful operations are evolving. These 
would lead to full scale provision of financial products and services that are well expanded and suited to 
the interests of people who were mainly excluded from financial services due to religious reasons.   
 
Expanding access points targeting the provision of sharia compliant financial transactions would help to 
lead to scale and then deepening. Banks, Microfinance institutions, insurers and lease companies 
particularly those who stand with a full-fledged status will be encouraged and coordinated to expand 
their branch outlets around feasible areas especially where Muslim community dominates. 
 
Sharia compliant finance has its own products, services and contracts that differ from conventional 
financial 
products 
and 
services. 
 
Some 
of 
these 
include Mudharabah (profit 
sharing), Wadiah (safekeeping), Musharakah (joint 
venture), 
Murababab (cost 
plus 
finance), Ijar (leasing), Hawala (an international fund transfer system), takaful (Islamic insurance), 
and sukuk (Islamic bonds).35 As per the data collected from the NBE, around 5.4 million Muslim adults

have transaction accounts with regulated financial institutions. Designing appropriate channels, 
products and services that comply with sharia principles would provide opportunities to further expand 
financial inclusion and support the financial ecosystem at large. 
 
2.7. Savings: Strong Savings Culture, with Significant Potential to Mobilize Formal Savings 
Savings is generally defined as the money remaining after subtracting spending from a disposable 
income.36 This can take numerous forms, mainly categorized into formal and informal savings. Formal 
savings can be money set aside in mobile wallets, bank checking accounts and various forms of 
conventional and sharia compliant accounts. The yield-bearing account subset is the ideal type of saving, 
as it mitigates inflationary losses and improves efficiency of capital allocation, ultimately leading to 
productive investments and economic growth.   
The percentage of Ethiopians reporting saving in formal institutions has risen steeply from 14% to ~30% 
of people in the past six years – higher than many international benchmark countries (Figure 17). 
However, given that 62% of adults reported savings (incl. informal) in the past year (Figure 16), there is 
still room to capitalize on Ethiopia’s strong, mostly informal savings culture, evidenced by the 
prevalence of Equb groups.37 In light of the many advantages formal savings offers, including interest, 
the 32% of adults who save only informally are a promising pool to target for migration into formal 
savings.

2.8. Credit: Credit Remains Limited, with Potential to Grow for MSMEs and Agriculture 
The percentage of adults reporting having a loan at a regulated financial institution stayed essentially 
constant, rising slightly to 11% from a baseline of 10%. Credit accounts38 per 100 adults also remained 
stagnant at 10 accounts, lower than most benchmark countries both in terms of relative growth (Figure 
19) and current absolute level (Figure 18).

More specifically, consumers with access to a loan at household level declined from 23% in 2016 to 16% 
in 2019. This was driven by a reduction of access to non-formal loans: Non-formal access to loans (i.e. 
relatives, neighbors, etc.) decreased by 16pp (71.4% to 55.5%) while formal access to loans (i.e. banks, 
SACCOs, MFIs) increased by 14pp (28.6% to 42.7%), partially offsetting the decline in loan access from 
non-formal sources.

to 2016.   
In addition, data indicates that business credit has increased but MSME and agriculture sectors have not 
benefitted proportionally. Private credit volume increased from ETB 264 billion to ETB 550 billion in 
three years, a ~110% increase. MSME and agriculture credit also increased in absolute terms (ETB 13 
billion to ETB 27 billion and ETB 37 billion to ETB 47 billion respectively), but by the same or smaller 
margins compared to total private credit (~112% and 26% respectively). As a result, both MSME and 
agriculture loans as a percentage of private credit remain relatively low, at 5% (from 4%) and 9% (from 
17%) respectively. This signals opportunity to increase access to credit for MSMEs and the agricultural 
sector to match the boom in credit in other sectors. 
2.9. Defining Interventions Framework 
In order to achieve this Strategy’s mission, specific interventions need to be defined. The National 
Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) 2016 had developed a comprehensive framework for defining 
interventions.  This framework remains in place with slight revisions. The revised framework this 
Strategy leverages recognizes three fundamental types of interventions: 
 
Consumer protection, capacity building and market structure interventions 
 
Financial infrastructure, including financial access points 
 
Innovative products and services 
The NFIS 2016 also recognizes four essential types of financial services whose availability constitutes full 
financial inclusion: 
 
Payments and related transactions; 
 
savings; 
 
Credit and other financing, such as leasing; and  
 
Insurance

In principle, dedicated actions for each type of essential financial service – payments, savings, credit or 
insurance – within each of the three interventions of the 
framework are needed. For instance, actions on 
consumer protection, on capacity building, or on product 
innovation for credit differ significantly from actions for 
improving access to payments services. The result can be 
visualized as a matrix (Figure 20).  
Actions defined within this Strategy cover each cell of 
this framework.  These individual actions are clustered 
together into Programs based on the specific strategic 
priorities they serve, to ensure that resources and 
efforts are channeled into challenges with most urgent 
need and largest opportunity for impact. Within the 
overall mission of scaling and deepening financial 
inclusion, this Strategy defines a range of specific 
priorities:

3. Vision , Mission, Approaches and Strategic Direction 
3.1.  Vision 
The Vision driving this strategy is: Financially Inclusive Ethiopia.  Conceptually, it has embedded three 
basic ideas: 
 
Universality: No Ethiopian adult should be left behind from financial inclusion; 
 
High-Quality: Suitable infrastructure and products & services designed to ensure informed 
financial decision-making, combined with financial education and financial consumer 
protection to improve every Ethiopian’s financial life; and 
 
Sustainability: Active transaction accounts with on-going usage through economically and 
socially sustainable scale up and deepening of the financial inclusion. 
Achieving this Vision will also be a critical enabler for broader sustainable development. It features as a 
target in eight of the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals39 and will serve as a foundational 
enabler and catalyst for four key national priorities: 
 
Make Ethiopia’s financial system more safe and sound by leveraging improved financial 
infrastructure, strengthened financial institutions and thorough consumer protection to expand 
the savings and deposit base in a responsible and sustainable way40; 
 
Create jobs & drive economic growth by reducing barriers to accessing conventional and 
sharia compliant credit, especially for MSMEs, women, and low-income households, and 
leveraging innovative business models41; 
 
Reduce poverty through increasing the economic resilience of low-income households via 
savings and insurance coverage and enabling them to fully participate in formal economic 
markets42; and 
 
Enhance capabilities for digital innovation with mobile money and other forms of digital 
finance, strong use cases, and training grounds for product innovation43 
3.2. Mission 
To make this Vision a reality, this Strategy sets out the following Mission: Scale up and deepen financial 
inclusion to ensure 70% of adults are included by 2025. 
The subsequent section explains its key elements, scaling and deepening. 
3.3. Strategic Approach  
The path to financial inclusion this Strategy charts consists of two sequential steps:  
                                                          
 
 
39 Including the SDGs on eradicating poverty; ending hunger; achieving food security and promoting sustainable 
agriculture; ensuring health and well-being; achieving gender equality and economic empowerment of women; 
promoting economic growth and jobs; supporting industry, innovation, and infrastructure; and reducing inequality. 
UNCDF, “Financial Inclusion and the SDG”; UNSGSA, “Igniting SDG Progress Through Digital Financial Inclusion” 
40 This is a key element of the National Bank of Ethiopia’s Mission, see “Mission of the Bank” 
41 Leveraging past achievements for job creation and sustainable growth is a core national priority. The 
Homegrown Economic Reform Agenda lays out this goal 
42 The Government of Ethiopia has adopted poverty reduction as its number one Sustainable Development Goal, 
with the aim of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030, see Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Ethiopia 
43 “Digital Ethiopia 2025”, Ethiopia’s national strategy for achieving digital transformation at a national scale, 
recognizes financial inclusion as an important enabler 
 
17  
3.3.1. Achieve Basic Financial Inclusion at Scale  
Increasing the number of people that own and use at least a payments-enabled account (incl. mobile 
wallet), either conventional or sharia compliant, with a financial institution or payments instrument 
issuer  
In line with the path charted above, scaling basic financial inclusion will be prioritized. Works in 
response to the NFIS 2016 have laid crucial regulatory foundations, including the Payment Instrument 
Issuers Directive and Use of Agents Directive. Actions defined by the National Digital Payment Strategy 
will expand those foundations, in particular payments infrastructure and regulatory enhancements. In 
addition, ongoing and planned basic infrastructure improvements– such as electricity, mobile coverage 
and penetration, and national ID – are crucial enablers. 
This Strategy identifies four additional priorities for achieving basic financial inclusion at scale: 
 
Drive digital payments by scaling mobile money, especially via dense and sustainable agent 
networks built on the backbone of robust bank and MFI branch network coverage;  
 
Drive financial inclusion in severely underserved parts of the country by creating pre-conditions 
for scaling digital finance and implementing targeted expansion approaches;  
 
Drive financial inclusion for women, ensuring gender-intentionality across all interventions and 
implementing priority actions for closing the financial inclusion gender gap across all products 
and services; and 
 
Developing sharia compliant financial infrastructure. 
Across these priorities, increased consumer protection efforts and financial education (including digital 
literacy campaigns) will be crucial to maintain trust in the financial system and make financial sector 
growth sustainable. 
In addition, data collection is identified as a Key Strategic Enabler. While major progress has been made 
with respect to the collection and analysis of financial inclusion data, room for improvement remains 
and hence is a key priority: 
Expand and adjust existing financial inclusion data collection methods, with respect to supply-side and 
demand-side data as well as data collaboration across regulators 
 
3.3.2. Leverage Scale to Deepen Financial Inclusion 
This approach is directed towards increasing the number of people that benefit from multiple, and 
ultimately all four (payments, savings44, credit, insurance) major types of financial products and services 
of either conventional or sharia compliant. 
Building on the role of digital payments and mobile money as a lever for achieving scale, deepening 
financial inclusion in parallel will focus on both conventional and sharia compliant savings, credit, and 
micro insurance). In addition to relying on crucial infrastructural enablers, these efforts will be closely 
aligned with interventions defined in the Rural Financial Intermediation Program (RUFIP) III and other 
national strategies. They will also leverage initial achievements of NFIS 2016 as their starting point. 
Taking these inputs into consideration, this Strategy follows a parallel approach for deepening financial 
inclusion: 
                                                          
 
 
44 “Yield-bearing” savings defined as either interest-bearing savings accounts or Islamic / Sharia-compliant savings 
accounts which create gains through approaches such as profit sharing; both types accumulate value over time. 
Stores of value which do not bear yields (such as simple mobile wallets) are not included in this definition. 
 
18  
 
First, lay foundations and generate immediate momentum for deepening of innovative 
financial services, including improved regulatory frameworks and digital infrastructure, to 
expand both conventional and sharia compliant savings, credit and insurance  
 
Building on these foundations, implement specific interventions for each of three essential 
conventional and sharia compliant financial services, namely: 
o Maximize savings mobilization, including pension schemes 
o Expand access to financing in particular with focus on MSMEs  
o Develop a strong micro-insurance system to improve crisis resilience 
 
3.3.3. Advance Financial Education and Consumers’ Protection – Cross Cutting Enabler for 
Both Scale and Deepening.    
Both scale and depth are essential elements of financial inclusion and are cross-enabled by financial 
education and consumers’ protection. The approach this Strategy adopts aims at achieving scale for 
basic financial inclusion while ensuring depth in parallel and ongoing basis. In adopting this path, this 
Strategy recognizes the paramount importance of financial inclusion at scale for inclusive growth: 
Achieving scale while actively driving depth of financial inclusion in parallel will greatly benefit the 
currently most disadvantaged Ethiopians. Aiming for greater depth without having basic financial 
inclusion scale would mean further increasing the gap between basically included population segments 
over currently fully excluded Ethiopians.45 
In Ethiopia, estimated 55% (based on Findex Global Survey of 2017) of adults have been excluded 
from formal financial transactions.  Low level of financial literacy and capability are among the 
major overarching causes for the exclusion. Ethiopia Financial Capability Survey (2017) indicated that 
roughly 82 percent of unbanked adults reported not owning an account due to a financial literacy or 
awareness barrier and nearly 85 percent and 80% of unbanked women and men respectively reported 
not knowing how or where to open an account. Financial education and consumers’ protection are, 
therefore, an essential cross cutting enablers to further scale up and deepen financial inclusion.   
These strategic approaches recognize that there is a clear and promising starting point in scaling minimal 
access – namely digital payments. Most countries that have successfully expanded financial inclusion 
over the past twenty years have followed this path of financial inclusion. Moreover, most of these 
countries have followed it in the same way – by scaling payments first, with a focus on digital and agent-
based payments (including ‘Cash In Cash Out’) products and channels. Examples include 
China46,Ghana47, Uganda48 and India49. The path to financial inclusion that this Strategy charts recognizes 
                                                          
 
 
45 This is particularly important given recent growths in the gaps between financially included and excluded 
population segments which would widen unless targeted interventions are taken. For instance, the gender gap has 
widened from 2% in 2014 to 12% in 2017 and a projected 19% in 202045; likewise, the gap between rural financial 
inclusion and the country average has widened from 10% in 2014/15 to 13% in 2018/19 – despite several 
measures, including those defined in the NFIS 2016, promoting financial inclusion and general development for 
rural areas. LSMS 2018/19; LSMS 2015/16 
46 Introduction of payment-focused the Alipay mobile wallet in 2008; 700m users by 2017; subsequent expansion 
into other products, especially consumer lending (Huabei, Jibei), savings (Yu'e Ba) and most recently insurance 
(Xiang Hu Bao). Other companies, most notably TenCent's WeChat Pay, follows similar trajectory. See World Bank:

of Financial Inclusion: “Digital Financial Inclusion in China”, 2019

these learning’s. It also recognizes that developments over the past years position Ethiopia well for 
rapidly scaling digital payments and mobile money, potentially leapfrogging intermediate phases: 
 
Mobile coverage has increased rapidly and is planned to reach 60% by 202550, potentially 
allowing for rapid uptake of digital financial services among currently-excluded population; 
 
Use of mobile wallets and digital payments has started to take off in many parts of the country 
over the past two years, from less than 1 million mobile money wallets in 2018 to a projected 
10 million by the end of 202051;  
 
Digitizing existing payment streams, in particular remittances and G2P transfers, allows 
harnessing these streams for formal financial inclusion;  
 
Branch networks in Ethiopia have expanded significantly52, providing the needed financial 
infrastructure for a more fine-grained agent network to function; and 
 
Learning from other countries, including regarding the importance of gender-intentional action 
and best practices for designing agent regulations and financial consumer protection, will be 
built into financial sector expansion from the ground up. 
 
3.4. Strategic Directions 
The strategic priorities across scale, deepening and cross cutting enabler are translated into Programs, 
with each of these eleven (11) priorities corresponding to the Programs focused on achieving it. Their 
sequencing is informed by the approach described above, with Programs aiming at scale being initiated 
first, and Programs aiming at deepening and financial education and consumers’ protection are initiated 
in parallel. The resultant program landscape is illustrated below

These strategic focus/Programs constitute the fundamental fabric of this Strategy. Their implementation 
will be started in parallel. An overview of each Program is provided in Section 4 of this document.  
Note that individual Programs (as well as this Strategy as a whole) intersect with a range of existing 
national strategies and priorities. Program-specific interdependencies are provided as part of the 
program descriptions (Section 4); an overall view is presented in Appendix 3 of this Strategy. 
Actions detailed in this strategy charts the implementation steps of each of the programs and strategic 
priorities.  The independent actions are assorted under each of the programs based on   strategic 
priorities. This would help to direct efforts and resources to a more focused and impactful results and 
the use of opportunities.  This strategy, therefore, presents identified priorities and actions that aim to 
promote financial inclusion in Ethiopia.

PROGRAMS & ACTIONS

4. Programs and Actions  
This Section details the eleven Programs designed for driving financial inclusion over the next five years, 
as introduced in the previous Vision, Mission and Approach section (Section 3). A description of the 
Programs is provided along with the respective list of Actions initiatives to be conducted.  
 
4.1.  Program A0: Key Strategic Enabler: Enhance financial inclusion data collection and analytics 
Box Note 1: This Program describes foundational actions for improving financial inclusion data 
availability, quality, frequency, and consistency. This Strategy is accompanied by a detailed 
Implementation Framework, which includes an in-depth Measurement and Evaluation (M&E) 
Framework. The M&E Framework builds on the actions laid out in this Program as well as other existing 
data sources, describing in detail all indicators to be tracked, their targets, data sources, tracking 
frequency, and reporting/escalation mechanisms.  
Reliable, sufficiently fine-grained, and updated data on the state of financial inclusion in Ethiopia is 
essential for understanding and communicating financial inclusion progress, identifying barriers, and 
designing interventions. The data needs to be detailed enough to identify gaps between demographics – 
especially gender and geography, but also youth, wealth, and education.  
Recent years have seen significant progress in financial inclusion data collection and analysis efforts, 
both with respect to supply-side data (data provided by financial institutions and payments instruments 
issuers to regulators) and demand-side data (data obtained from consumer surveys).  
Key supply-side data sources include: 
 
Quarterly data on access points, financial product adoption, and usage provided by banks, 
micro-finance institutions, and insurance providers to the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) (the 
primary supply-side data source on financial inclusion) 
 
A one-time Ethiopia geospatial report by the World Bank in conjunction with the NBE, 
containing analysis of financial access point coverage and financial readiness at woreda level  
 
Supplements from government entities such as the Federal Cooperation Agency (FCA), Ethiopia 
Communications Authority (ECA), Ministry of Finance (MOF), and Policy Studies Institute (PSI) 
Key demand-side data sources include: 
 
The triennial Global Findex survey (collected by the World Bank) covers access, adoption, and 
usage of various products and services with respect to financial inclusion. It contains 
demographic splits, but no breakdown beyond national level due to its sample size of ~1,000 
individuals  
 
The biennial Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) financial inclusion module (collected 
with the Central Statistical Agency (CSA) and World Bank) also covers access, adoption and 
usage,53 and also contains demographic splits, with a breakdown by region and larger sample of 
over 6,700 households and ~15,000 individuals 
                                                          
 
 
53 The financial inclusion module began with the third wave of the LSMS, in 2015/16. The fourth wave of the LSMS 
which was conducted in 2018/19 is the first survey of the ESS panel II, with new households being interviewed 
compared to previous waves and the next round scheduled for 2021/22. 
 
24  
 
A stand-alone National Financial Capability Survey was carried out in 2017 jointly by the NBE, 
CSA and World Bank.54 The survey incorporates demographic splits, with a breakdown by 
region and a sample size of ~3,000 respondents 
Building on these developments, there is significant opportunity to further enhance the financial 
inclusion data, by addressing areas for improvement in data inputs, methodology, and collection 
frequency:  
 
Limitations in supply-side data including limited availability of geographical and demographic 
splits (especially gender) and omission of crucial indicators55  
 
Lack of an integrated, analytical framework to leverage different demand-side data sources 
(especially LSMS and Findex) in a consistent, transparent, and effective way  
 
Absence of a unified financial inclusion database to provide data visibility and facilitate cross-
institutional alignment 
Three actions have been defined to address these areas for improvement: 
 
Action 1: Improve supply-side data collection by including demographic and geospatial breakdowns   
 
Action 2: Define and implement integrated analytical framework for demand-side data and 
optimize collection  
 
Action 3: Create and maintain a central Financial Inclusion Database  
 
4.2. Program A1: Drive Digital Payments by Scaling Mobile Money  
Box Note 2: National Digital Payments Strategy 
The NBE recently developed the National Digital Payments Strategy (2020-24).56 The NDPS is a key 
enabler for this Strategy. The Actions developed build on the four major pillars of the NDPS: 
 
Develop a reliable and interoperable infrastructure: NDPS aims at establishing full 
interoperability across payment channels, enhancing access to basic infrastructure, and 
developing payments infrastructure. This includes the expansion of ATMs, POS, M-POS etc. 
These complement existing initiatives in the ecosystem by stakeholders such as Ethio-
telecom, Eth-Switch57 and more. Expansion targets will also be set and tracked by the NDPS. 
 
Champion adoption of digital payments: NDPS prioritizes use case categories to drive digital 
payments adoption58 across digital payment channels. These efforts are supported by market 
incentives to drive adoption and discourage cash transactions.  
 
Build a robust regulatory and oversight framework: NDPS aims to strengthen the regulatory 
capacity of the NBE and revise required regulations to enable digital payments uptake,59 
                                                          
 
 
54 This was the first edition of this survey. If repeated, it could be used as one of the main sources of data.  
55 SACCO data from the FCA is currently not included in tracking of transaction, saving and credit account. Mobile 
money accounts such as M-Birr and other FinTech accounts were not included as part of transaction accounts. 
Micro-insurance data from MFIs and SACCOs was not included, causing conflicting results between supply and 
demand side data. It also does not track frequency of usage and does not have regional or gender split of adoption 
indicators. 
56 NDPS Vision Statement 
57 Eth-Switch, the national switch, is currently developing a real-time payments system, amongst other efforts  
58 Including use cases on government payments, tourism, agricultural transactions and remittance 
 
25  
including effective implementation of recently-approved directives. 
 
Create an enabling environment for innovation: The NDPS identifies a need to enhance 
participation and unlock the full potential of new players in innovation and technology, 
particularly targeting the active participation of FinTech.  
Program A1, under the refreshed NFIS, leverages the NDPS as a key enabler and is focused on 
enhancing financial inclusion through digital payments. Implementation of this Strategy will be in 
close collaboration and alignment with the NDPS. Also see the Governance Section of this Strategy. 
The NFIS 2016 leveraged the expansion of traditional financial access points to increase financial 
inclusion and set targets for the expansion of branches. Accordingly, bank and MFI branch networks 
have expanded over the past few years, growing from ~5,100 branches in 2016 to ~8,500 branches60 in 
2020.  Similarly, increased adoption of financial services was targeted, with adoption rates growing by 
23 percentage points over the past six years (22% in 2014 to an estimated 45% in 2020)61. However, 
neither access point expansion, nor adoption rate improvements were uniform: 
 
Access points were expanded in urban centers.62 Rural locations, with lower population density 
and economic activity, offered less attractive business cases, and are yet to be adequately 
covered 
 
Adoption rates also showed disparity across the country, with far lower adoption in rural areas, 
partially driven by the lack of access points described above63 
 
These developments also contributed to a growing wealth gap between those with and without 
access to financial services64 
 
In addition, a large and growing gender gap has been noted, partially due to emphasis on 
traditional access points to date, relative to digital alternatives65 
The NFIS 2016 had explored the use of non-traditional, low-cost access points to support expansion of 
financial services in rural areas. Accordingly, it had targeted the expansion of agent and mobile banking. 
Commercial banks rolled out various initiatives leveraging agent and mobile banking over the past few 
years and have made notable progress in increasing adoption of digital payments. However, 
implementation has also identified three key areas for improvement: 66,67

formal financial institutions within 5 km; while 90% of those in urban centers do; LSMS 2018/2019 
64 43% of the richest 60% had accounts in 2017 (and registered a 17pp growth since 2014), while only 22% of the 
poorest 40% had accounts in 2017 (with only 7pp increase registered for the same time period) 
65 Studies show that digital financial services help expand FI to women: BTCA, 2020; CGAP. Similar patterns in 
Ethiopia noted with digital channels showing far lesser financial inclusion gaps: ATM (4pp), Online banking (1pp), 
Mobile Banking (2pp), compared to overall inclusion gap of 19pp; LSMS 2018/19; 2020 projection using LSMS

 
Business case for agents and providers to scale sustainably in rural areas negatively impacted 
by low transaction volumes in rural areas and high initial cost of setting up an agent office  
 
Limited use cases that enable the use of digital payments 
 
Limited community awareness on the practicality and use of digital payments  
This Program aims to resolve these specific challenges and drive increased adoption of digital payments 
in Ethiopia, leveraging a strong agent network.68 It primarily focuses on mobile money as a key channel 
to drive expansion of digital payments, especially in rural areas and for excluded demographics such as 
women and lower-income households.69 The expansion of traditional access points (such as bank and 
MFI branches) will be essential enablers to support a viable agent business case and further drive the 
agent network growth. Program A2 of this Strategy details this further. 
Recently issued directives70 lay the regulatory foundations for the success of this Program by allowing 
various non-bank and telecom companies to actively engage in issuing payment instruments71, and 
providing for non-exclusivity of agents. Continued expansion of payment instrument issuers and market 
entries, in line with these regulations and the NDPS, is a prerequisite for the success of this Program, 
and will continuously be monitored by the Financial Inclusion Secretariat and the NDPS Project 
Management Unit. 
The success of this Program will be significantly enhanced with the improvement of basic infrastructure, 
such as power, telecommunications, and access to mobile phones. National plans are in place for their 
expansion72; various additional strategies (including the NDPS and Digital Ethiopia 2025) also identify 
initiatives targeting these areas. The National Digital ID program (under development by the Ministry of 
Peace) is likewise a key enabler for this Program, allowing for unique identification of individuals, 
supporting Know Your Customer (KYC). Improvements across all these will enable faster scale of 
financial inclusion and will be continually tracked by the Financial Inclusion Secretariat to inform 
progress against targets (see Targets section). 
Capitalizing on these foundations, four priority actions and two initiatives (as already addressed by 
NDPS) have been defined to address the aforementioned areas for improvement:  
Action 1:  
Enable sustainable digital payment agent network expansion by leveraging and 
supporting viable business cases;  
Action 2: 
 Roll out digital payment agency service for SACCOs and MFIs; 
Action 3:   
Integrate and roll out digital payments (focused on mobile money) across 
 
priority G2P/P2G and social/humanitarian payments; 
                                                          
 
 
68 The broader set of challenges in the digital payments space and solutions targeted for their resolution are 
covered in the National Digital Payment Strategy, NBE, 2020 
69 Evidence from multiple countries shows the value of mobile money/digital payments in driving financial 
inclusion; Ghana: How Ghana Became One of Africa’s Top Mobile Money Markets, CGAP, 2018; China: World Bank: 
“Toward Universal Financial Inclusion in China: Models, Challenges, and Global Lessons”, 2018; Chinese Academy 
of Financial Inclusion: “Digital Financial Inclusion in China”, 2019; Uganda: Financial Inclusion Insights: “Uganda 
Wave 5 Report. Fifth Annual Fii Tracker Survey”, 2018; India: The Economic Times, August 3, 2020 (“Bank accounts 
opened under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana crosses 40-crore mark”) 
 
70 Licensing and Authorization of Payment Instrument Issuers Directive; Use of Agents Directive 
71 Opening mobile wallets that are not linked to bank accounts

27  
Action 4:  
Develop and implement targeted and responsible awareness creation campaign 
on mobile money and agent use; 
Action 5:  
Expand payment schemes such as real time, national payment gateway, 
interoperability, and QR code (initiative); and 
Action 6:  
Expand ATMs, POS devices and internet banking services (initiative). 
 
The success of this Program relies on the active participation of the private sector as developers of 
payment products, as agents and agent contractors, and as active marketers of payment products. The 
NDPS identifies the required changes to create market conditions that encourage participation of the 
private sector. This Program aims to guide private sector development towards advancing financial 
inclusion via digital payments.  
NB: Within the context of this Program, an agent refers to an entity contracted by a financial institution 
to facilitate an agency business service in the name and on behalf of a financial institution. Agency 
business refers to transaction/cash-in, cash-out services and does not refer to insurance or saving 
agents; as defined in the Use of Agents Directive No. FIS/02/2020.  
4.3. Program A2: Drive Financial Inclusion in Severely Underserved Areas  
Challenges and opportunities for socio-economic development and financial inclusion vary heavily by 
location-specific factors. Both the degree of current financial access and the viability of efforts to expand 
financial inclusion depend on the socio-economic profile of a given location. The following factors play 
an important role: 
 
Mobile connectivity: Mobile connectivity is a key enabler for financial services access points, 
especially agents  
 
Electricity: Electricity is needed for all forms of digital financial services with electricity cost 
being a significant factor in access point viability 
 
Connectivity to larger financial infrastructure: Due to the need of liquidity in cash, most access 
points rely on a nearby bank branch or ATM for cash liquidity management. This reliance is 
decreased when digital integration is achieved 
 
Population density: Total demand in a given area is driven to a large degree by the size of 
population - lower population density areas are less economically viable for financial access 
points 
 
Wealth and income levels: Expected revenues, and therefore viability, of access points is 
heavily dependent on average transaction values, which is driven by local wealth and income 
levels 
 
Degree and type of economic activity: The faster capital circulates in a given economy, the 
higher the demand for financial services; the structure of the local economy (such as flow of 
remittances) also impacts viability of financial access points 
 
Financial awareness and literacy: Speed of uptake of financial services is influenced by 
awareness and financial and digital literacy, which often varies significantly between locations  
These factors are not independent; rather, they support and reinforce each other. In a positive direction, 
this is a major force behind urbanization. However, the potential disadvantage of this process is the 
neglect of already-underserved areas. Wealth, population density, infrastructure, and financial inclusion 
gaps could widen between the strongest areas (urban centers) and the weakest ones (extreme rural 
areas). 
 
28  
Various cross-sectoral policies and strategies, including the Rural Financial Intermediation Program 
(RUFIP) III and Digital Ethiopia 2025, recognize these challenges and define actions targeted at 
expanding fundamental infrastructure and capabilities in underserved areas. 
In complement to these ongoing efforts, this Program aims to address areas for improvement for 
expanding financial inclusion in underserved areas, recognizing that such areas require tailored solutions 
and dedicated resources. Three main areas for improvement specific to underserved areas have been 
identified:  
 
Many severely underserved areas lack traditional financial infrastructure, especially MFI and 
bank branches, with some woredas often lacking even a single branch. Given the role of such 
branches as hubs in a network of smaller financial access points, this is an important area for 
improvement to expand financial inclusion 
 
Extremely sparse population density and very low economic activity make standard models for 
financial service provision economically unviable, posing challenges even to agent-based 
models 
 
Levels of financial inclusion, as well as overall socio-economic profiles, vary between Ethiopia’s 
regions. Enabling relatively underserved regions to catch up will require sustained, focused and 
tailored solutions powered by dedicated resources 
Six actions are designed to address these challenges: 
 
Action 1:  
Expand “traditional” financial infrastructure73, especially bank and MFI 
branches, to cover severely underserved woredas as key enablers for agent 
networks and digital finance; 
Action 2:  
Design and pilot dedicated financial access approach for low-readiness areas to 
improve economic viability, including dedicated capability building; 
Action 3:  
Conduct studies to promote and expand traditional financial products and 
services that meet the needs of respective regions; 
Action 4:  
Establish Regional Council for Financial Inclusion (RCFI); and  
Action 5:  
Establish Regional Financial Inclusion Task Forces and design and publish 
Financial Inclusion Framework. and 
Action 6:  
Formulate and implement financial inclusion framework that is conducive and 
aligned to the circumstances of the regions  
 
4.4. Program A3: Drive Financial Inclusion for Women 
Box Note 3: Financial inclusion for women is a cross-cutting theme of this Strategy. This Strategy 
takes gender intentionality as an overall focus, and specific efforts and lenses are included 
throughout all Programs to ensure that all products, services, channels, and general initiatives are 
designed with women in mind. Program A3 will serve as the anchor point for this gender 
intentionality and focus. 
 
However, this Program also provides a specific focus on high-priority women’s financial inclusion 
                                                          
 
 
73 Other programs such as DFS and financial education will be carried out in parallel under their own respective 
programs. 
 
29  
issues which will be addressed through Actions described. Program A3 also links with Program A1 
and A2, leveraging digital and recognizing intersectionality of gender and location. 
 
Importantly, this Program extends beyond scaling financial inclusion (primarily focused on payments) 
and into aspects of deepening financial inclusion. While a focus will be on increasing prevalence of 
basic financial inclusion74 among women and closing the headline gender gap, efforts will also be 
initiated to drive uptake of savings, credit, and insurance among women. This Program will therefore 
link to and support efforts in Program B0-B3 for financial deepening through the WFITF. 
 
Ethiopia has made substantial progress on overall gender equity in recent years. In 2020, Ethiopia was 
placed 82nd on global gender gap rankings, rising from 117th only two years prior and moving to 13th out 
of 34 Sub-Saharan African countries surveyed.75 
With respect to financial inclusion, however, gender equity has decreased. In particular, the gender gap 
in overall account ownership has expanded to an estimated 19 percentage points (pp) in 2020 from 2pp 
as of 2014,76 larger than peer countries such as Uganda (13pp), Kenya (8pp), and India (6pp) as of 2017 
(the most recent data available).77 This gap varies across types of financial service providers and is most 
pronounced among more formal providers – 16pp with public banks and 8pp with private banks, vs. 3pp 
and 2pp with SACCOs and MFIs, respectively.78 The account ownership gap is accompanied by gaps with 
respect to mobile money and mobile phones (women are 67% less likely to have mobile money accounts 
and 30% less likely to own/use a mobile phone); savings (women are 40% less likely to save); and credit 
(women half as likely to have an MFI or SACCO loan).79 
Given the role of financial inclusion as a fundamental enabler for growth, this gender gap reverberates 
throughout the economy. It likely is a key contributor to unequal opportunities: Ethiopia still ranks 125th 
globally in economic opportunity, which is partially linked to financial inclusion via access to credit.80 
This contributes to a dampening of growth and costs Ethiopia an estimated ~$3.7B (~5% of GDP) 
annually, with 60% of this loss driven by a disadvantage for women’s agricultural and entrepreneurial 
activity.81 
For these reasons, the Government of Ethiopia has identified reducing and closing the gender gap in 
financial inclusion as a key strategic priority. This Strategy identifies three areas for improvement: 
 
Drivers for financial inclusion gap are not fully understood. Comprehensive research on what 
causes the financial inclusion gender gap for women in Ethiopia has not been conducted and 
knowledge is limited. However, given international experience as well as tendencies in other 
parts of Ethiopia’s economy, drivers are likely to be a combination of: (a) gender gaps in 
fundamental enablers, such as phone ownership, income levels, and education – for example,

lack of collateral limiting credit access for women;82 (b) general societal norms favoring men;83 
(c) institutional patterns, such as limited number of women in financial institution leadership 
positions; and (d) partly driven by the first two factors, unmet gender-specific needs for 
particular financial products, channels or types of access points. It is unclear, however, what 
exactly within these categories contributes to the gender gap to what extent, and consequently 
unclear how to intervene most effectively. 
 
Limited outreach and sign-up campaigns for women. Active outreach, awareness and sign-up 
campaigns geared at directly increasing account ownership and account usage of unbanked 
adults in general, and women in particular are not a major part of the operating models of 
major financial institutions in Ethiopia.84 This reliance on individuals taking personal initiative is 
likely to increase the impact of underlying gender gaps, for example, with respect to education, 
financial literacy, income and free time. Conversely, active outreach campaigns, that especially 
target women, could potentially reduce the gender gap even where underlying gender gaps 
persist. 
 
Gender intentionality85 within the financial sector is relatively rare. The above two challenges 
can be regarded as specific instances of a more fundamental need for change. There generally 
is limited focus placed on women’s inclusivity by institutions – this is a core up-stream driver of 
the gender gap. In the financial sector, sensitivity for gender issues and motivation to gear 
business towards women is limited, and there is no common framework, initiative, or target for 
women. This is mirrored by a lack of gender mainstreaming86 in key initiatives by other 
stakeholders which indirectly contribute to financial inclusion, though a general national 
gender strategy is being drafted currently as part of the ten-year National Perspective Plan.87 
Effectively closing the gap will require stronger and more directed focus from all relevant 
parties. 
This Program will address each of these areas for improvement by (1) achieving a deep understanding of 
what drives the financial inclusion gender gap, what specific barriers women face and which of their 
needs are unmet; (2) immediately begin closing the fundamental gender gap in account ownership by 
targeted awareness and enrollment campaigns; and (3) anchoring gender intentional efforts in the 
financial sector and in all financial inclusion efforts, thereby building gender inclusivity into Ethiopia’s 
financial sector DNA.  
                                                          
 
 
82 For instance, women are far less likely to have a kebele ID, far less likely to own any type of collateral to access 
credit, and on average less financially aware and capable due to structural biases – 61% of rural women have heard 
of MFIs versus 78% of men, and only 27% know where and how to open an account versus 41% of men. And while 
Labor force participation is relatively strong within Sub-Saharan Africa at 77% (vs. 88% men), women face barriers 
to formal employment and the wage ratio is 63%; see National Financial Capability Survey 2017; World Bank data 
on ID for Development (ID4D), 2018; IMF report, “Women and the Economy in Ethiopia”, 2018

This will be accomplished specifically through the following four priority Actions and three Initiatives: 
Action 1: 
Establish a knowledge base on women’s unmet financial needs and barriers to 
financial inclusion;  
Action 2:  
Launch women's account enrollment and educational outreach campaigns with 
a prioritized focus on youth, linking to NFES; 
Action 3:  
Promote at least ¼ of the Senior Management (VP and Directors) of the financial 
institutions to be women, who will be mainly dedicated to promote women 
financial inclusion;  
Action 4:  
Promote at least one woman to have a seat on the board of the financial 
institutions;  
Action 5:  
Study and formulate a policy to encourage and motivate women financial 
inclusion, such as allowing increased saving interest rate  (Initiatives); 
Action 6:  
Study and establish credit guarantee scheme dedicated to women financing 
(Initiatives); and   
Action 7:  
Study and establish wholesale funding dedicated to women financing (to 
address liquidity issues of lending institutions, (Initiatives). 
 
Program A3 intends to sustainably close the financial inclusion gender gap with a multifaceted supply 
and demand-side approach under an over-arching refocus on gender equity and intentionality. In 
addition to these Actions, gender-intentional lenses are present throughout all other Programs of this 
Strategy. 
4.5. Program A4: Drive Sharia Compliant Financial Access Points 
Expanding access points would create conducive environment to scale up sharia compliant financial 
transactions. Sharia compliant financial products and services providers i.e. Banks, Microfinance 
institutions, insurers and lease companies particularly those who stand with a full-fledged status will be 
encouraged and coordinated to expand their branch outlets around feasible areas especially where 
Muslim community dominates.   
 
To address the issues, the following three priority actions under this program have been formulated:  
Action 1:  
Enhance ecosystem for Sharia-compliant financial access points and digital 
financial services by conducting a study, and designing interventions to drive 
scale; 
Action 2:  
Expand branches of financial institutions as an access point for sharia complaint 
products and services; and  
Action 3:  
Promote Sharia-compliant transaction accounts. 
 
 
4.6. Program B0: Lay Foundations for Deepening of Innovative   Conventional and Sharia 
Compliant Financial Services and Create Momentum 
Programs A1-A3 focus on scaling basic financial access and usage with a strong positioning on digital 
payments and mobile money across all geographies and demographic groups, especially women. 
Programs B0-B3 chart a roadmap for the deepening of a broader range of financial services; in particular 
Program B0 addresses first-priority foundational initiatives to prime the ecosystem for expansion of all 
financial services beyond payments and create momentum for deepening, while Program B1-B3 address 
 
32  
additional market-building opportunities in yield-bearing88 savings and pension (B1)89, productive credit 
(B2)90, and micro-insurance91 (B3).  
Widespread access to and usage of financial services beyond payments – especially yield-bearing savings 
and pension, productive credit, and micro-insurance – is critical. Greater deepening within these 
services will contribute to a transformational effect along numerous development dimensions, 
particularly linked to macroeconomic and financial system stability and sectoral growth for agriculture 
and key industries.92 Maturation of these services will conversely itself be impacted by broader 
contributing factors outside the sole scope of financial inclusion, for example interest rates and 
inflation93 which will affect trust and motivations for consumers and financial institutions.94 These 
factors will also be coordinated outside of NFIS 2020 to benefit financial deepening, in addition to 
financial inclusion initiatives in this Strategy. 
Until now, such services in Ethiopia have largely been provided through physical interaction with “brick 
and mortar” networks. The National Digital Payments Strategy is empowering the shift to a digital 
system by promoting mobile wallet uptake (among other channels) for payments, but the requirements 
for digitizing and expanding savings, credit, and insurance are beyond requirements for digital 
payments95. A comprehensive new set of regulatory and infrastructural enablers are required to catalyze 
expansion and digitization of financial services beyond payments.  
This Program describes Actions designed to lay the foundations for deepening of key financial services, 
building on the scale achieved from digital payments and combining both in-person and digitally-
enabled elements. Four areas for improvement have been identified: 
 
Cross-cutting foundations: The regulatory / oversight and supporting environment are not yet 
consolidated and readied to fully address opportunities in micro-96 and digital financial services 
beyond payments (yield-bearing savings and pension, productive credit, and micro-insurance), 
resulting in limited digital and agent network for services beyond payments and ‘Cash In Cash 
                                                          
 
 
88 “Yield-bearing” savings defined as either interest-bearing savings accounts or Islamic / Sharia-compliant savings 
accounts which create gains through approaches such as profit sharing; both types accumulate value over time. 
Stores of value which do not bear yields (such as simple mobile wallets) are not included in this definition. Informal 
placement of deposits such as Equb or Edir are not included; while they may accumulate, they do not build yields  
89 Definition in this case includes general long-term savings; does not need to be linked to a formal pension 
program 
90 “Productive” refers to borrowing which supports the generation of income (versus “consumptive” borrowing 
such as regular household needs/wants). However, this Strategy also highlights a few specific use cases which are 
not traditionally “productive” but will be prioritized for developmental purposes; these include solar energy and 
water and sanitation. Source: FinDev Gateway, “Productive Versus Consumption Loans”, 2019 
91 Defined as “Any form of protection against risks that is designed for and accessed by low income people, 
provided by different categories of carriers but operating on business principles of insurance and funded by 
premium”, in alignment with NBE “Licensing, License Renewal and Product Approval for Microinsurance Providers 
Directive No. SMIB/3/2020”. Can include both short-term and long-term insurance types for a variety of use cases 
92 Homegrown Economic Reform Agenda 2019; Plan of Action for Job Creation, 2019 
93 Among other factors such as income levels and general education 
94 E.g. higher inflation rates destroy value if not stored in yield-bearing accounts; interest rates will have inverse 
effects on savings versus lending (ideally high savings rates/low lending rates would be available) but must balance 
95 Including provisions for digitization of account enrollment and policy/loan applications, onboarding, claims, 
account management, customer service, etc. 
96 E.g. referring to small-scale products and services for low-income populations, not MFI services specifically  
 
33  
Out’ and potential consumer protection risks given new market dynamics. Opportunities that 
could significantly enhance these include:  
o Market testing regulations and models for Digital Financial Services (DFS) providers and 
agents for savings, credit, and insurance  
o Operationalizing the NBE Consumer Protection and Financial Education Directorate 
(CPFED), National Financial Education Strategy (NFES), and Financial Education Fund 
(FEF)  
o Increased coordination to explore and enhance underlying infrastructures (such as 
information technology) for digitized savings, credit, and insurance 
 
Conventional and Sharia compliant savings and pension mobilization: Limitations to 
effectiveness of products, channels, and approaches (both interest-bearing and Islamic / 
Sharia-compliant) to draw short and long-term savings from emerging businesses and low-
income populations  
 
Productive credit environment: Early-stage infrastructure and limited presence of inclusive 
products on the market to serve collateral-constrained businesses and individuals  
 
Micro-insurance market: Nascent landscape for insurance in general, and especially micro-
insurance offerings (in agriculture, MSME, life, and health) best suited to financially-excluded 
businesses and population segments 
Four Actions have been defined to address these areas for improvement: 
Action 1:  
Enhance and consolidate the regulatory and supporting environment for 
financial services beyond payments to facilitate digital channels and innovative 
offerings;  
Action 2:  
Enhance savings and pension ecosystem and offerings with focus on innovative 
products and mobilization outreach; 
Action 3:  
Enhance productive credit ecosystem and offerings through credit information 
and movable asset-based lending; and 
Action 4: 
 Enhance micro-insurance ecosystem and offerings via business case and index 
data infrastructure. 
Importantly, these initiatives will include not only foundational actions to lead into B1-B3 (such as 
regulation and infrastructure), but also immediate-impact actions executed during Program B0 itself to 
create momentum for deepening. Examples include mobilization and deposit collection campaigns for 
savings (B0.2), movable collateral community education and promotion efforts for credit (B0.3), and 
support for the launch of innovative offerings in micro-insurance (B0.4). 
4.7. Program B1: Maximize Savings Mobilization 
This Program lays out Actions to facilitate access to and usage of yield-bearing savings and pension for a 
wider population, crucially including underserved – largely rural – areas and excluded demographics, in 
particular women. The Actions described here build on those laid out in Program B0, in particular on a 
consolidated regulatory framework that facilitates digital channels and innovative products (Action 1) 
and foundational work for an improved savings and pension ecosystem (Action 2). 
Learnings from these preceding Actions, including leveraging unexpected opportunities and mitigations 
for unforeseen risks, will inform subsequent work on driving access and usage of formal savings. 
Nonetheless, two potential areas for improvement for fully leveraging newly-created foundations and 
expand access to and usage of formal savings and pension can be anticipated: 
 
34  
 
Demand and supply-side inertia and problems with initial business case risk delaying 
introduction and scaled adoption of digital savings and pension products  
 
Widespread community savings methods unlikely to fully benefit from advances made unless 
link to formal financial system is strengthened 
Four priority Actions and one Initiative have been defined to address these areas for improvement: 
The corresponding Program identifies: 
Action 1: 
 Promote digital savings; 
Action 2:  
Carry out studies to introduce private pension scheme particularly for low  
 
 
income people; 
Action 3: 
 Expand traditional financial savings; 
Action 4: 
 Promote all G2p and P2G payments97 to be made through bank and MFIs 
accounts; and 
Action 5:  
Work on members of cooperatives, Edir, community saving (Equb), Community 
health insurance scheme and others to promote account opening and savings 
with financial institutions (initiative). 
 
4.8. Program B2: Expand Access to Financing  
Box Note 4: Expanding access to financing is a key focus of a number of existing strategies:  
 
The Rural Financial Intermediation Program (RUFIP) III launched in October 2020 will 
provide ~$300M in 2020-2025 to enhance the rural financial system with major actions 
related to credit access; RUFIP III in particular will require closest integration with Program 
B2 given its mandate is fully aligned to financial inclusion  
 
The Plan of Action for Job Creation (PAJC) was launched by the Jobs Creation Commission 
(JCC) and intends to generate jobs in key industrial and service sectors, with a major focus 
on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) as a driver of this growth. Multiple credit access 
levers have been prioritized to support this  
 
Other initiatives such as the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) draft ten-year strategy, Women 
Entrepreneurship Development Project (WEDP) and SME Financing Project (SMEFP) have 
complementary mandates to be aligned to as well 
The Actions of this Strategy are aligned and coordinated strongly to complement the activities of 
RUFIP III, Plan of Action for Job Creation and other initiatives. The NFIS-II will leverage and build 
upon these initiatives while helping to convene financial inclusion stakeholders around them. 
Details on coordination are described in Action 1 of this Program and the Appendix section. 
Coordination continues from Action B0.3; refer to that Action for more information. 
This Program lays out Actions for supporting credit market shaping and innovation of new financing 
products and services. The Actions described here build on those laid out in Program B0, in particular on 
a consolidated regulatory framework that facilitates digital channels and innovative products (Action 1) 
and foundational work for an improved productive credit ecosystem (Action 3).

35  
Learnings from these preceding Actions will inform subsequent work on driving access to financing.  
Nonetheless, given past developments and trends, two areas for improvement will require sustained 
attention and dedicated interventions: 
 
The proportion of loans to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) has stagnated at 5% 
of private sector credit98 (ETB 27 billion) versus an NFIS 2016 goal of 15%99. In-depth research 
indicates that this is particularly driven by limited access to financing for small and medium 
enterprises (the “Missing Middle”), crucially including women-owned enterprises. Constrained 
financing to key industrial sectors (such as agro-processing, textiles and apparel, leather, 
construction, and more) has potential consequences on job creation  
 
The percentage of adults with a regulated credit account still remains at ~11%, versus a much 
higher NFIS 2016 goal;100 this constrains families from accessing credit for key developmental 
needs  
The first of these areas for improvement, and selected elements of the second, are extensively 
addressed in existing strategies and frameworks, in particular the Rural Financial Intermediation 
Program (RUFIP) III. The corresponding Action in this Strategy focuses on alignment between these 
strategies and identifies a limited number of complementary measures.  
This Program intends to increase productive credit for enterprises (SMEs in key sectors and agriculture), 
and individuals by addressing structural/functional issues in the financial sector and improving products 
and services via the following three Actions and two initiatives: 
Action 1:  
Increase financing options for the “Missing Middle” (integration with RUFIP III 
and other strategies); 
Action 2:  
Promote responsible digital micro-credit products with appropriate guardrails; 
Action 3: 
Promote movable assets as collateral for loan; 
Action 4: 
Study to increase financing options for cooperatives (initiative); and 
Action 5:  
Study to increase financing options for households (initiative) 
 
4.9. Program B3: Develop a Strong Micro-insurance System 
This Program defines Actions for developing a strong micro-insurance system. The Actions described 
here build on those laid out in Program B0, in particular on a consolidated regulatory framework that 
facilitates digital channels and innovative products (Action 1), and foundational work for an improved 
insurance ecosystem (Action 4). 
Learnings from these preceding Actions will inform subsequent work on driving access and usage of 
formal insurance. Three potential areas for improvement to fully leveraging the newly-created 
foundations and expanding formal insurance access and usage can be anticipated: 
 
In agriculture, insurance needs substantial scale to be successful, and this will require high 
investments and underlying financial structures, potentially too large for any single-market 
player to provide 
                                                          
 
 
98 In addition to the proportion of agricultural loans as a percentage of private credit which overlaps with MSME 
loans; this has declined to 9% in 2020 from 17% in 2016. NBE June 2020 supply-side data

36  
 
In other types of insurance (enterprise insurance for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises 
(MSME); personal insurance for life, and health), healthy market-building and innovation is 
challenged by limited capacity and nascent business case 
 
Existing informal insurance (Edir) is unlikely to fully benefit from advances made unless link to 
formal financial system is strengthened 
The corresponding Program identifies four priority Actions and one Initiative: 
 
Action 1:  
Scale national agricultural insurance (integration with MOA strategy and RUFIP  
 
 
III);  
Action 2: 
Promote market entry and innovation in micro-insurance, including via   
 
 
InsurTech; 
Action 3:  
Promote insurance for movable assets that serve as collateral for loan;  
Action 4:  
Expand and strengthen access and distribution channels for microinsurance; and 
Action 5:  
Link Edir to the formal financial system (initiative). 
 
4.10. Program B4: Drive Sharia Compliant Financial Products and Services 
Sharia compliant finance has its own products, services and contracts that differ from the conventional 
practices. Some of these include Mudaharabah (profit sharing), adiah (safekeeping),  Musharakah (joint 
venture), Murababab (cost plus finance), Ijar (leasing), Hawala (an international fund transfer system), 
takaful (Islamic insurance), and sukuk (Islamic bonds).101  Due to ineffectiveness of products, channels, 
and approaches to draw short and long-term savings from emerging businesses and low-income 
opulations, however, sharia compliant savings, financing, insurance/takful and pension mobilization 
have been limited.   
 
Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey 2018/2019 carried out by CSA in 2018/2019 indicted that only 11.7% of 
Muslim adults’ (ages 18+), own interest free banking accounts.  The high level of exclusion, roughly 88%, 
among others, can be explained by lack of both access points and suitable products and services that 
conform to sharia principles and practices.  To resolve the possible barriers and then deepen financial 
inclusion of adults who have been excluded due to religious reasons, the following four priority actions 
under this program have been mapped:  
 
Action 1:  
Enhance ecosystem for Sharia-compliant financial products and services by 
conducting a detailed study, and designing interventions to drive product 
availability and adoption; 
Action 2:  
Promote Sharia-compliant savings; 
Action 3:  
Promote Sharia-compliant financing and responsible digital micro-credit, with 
appropriate guardrails; and 
Action 4:  
Promote micro takaful (Islamic insurance).  
 
4.11. C1: Cross Cutting - Financial Education and Consumers protection 
This program is formulated to promote financial education and financial consumers’ protection and 
guided by the National Financial Education Strategy (NFES) and Financial Consumers Protection Directive

37  
that are recently approved by the Board of the National Bank of Ethiopia.  The Program identifies five 
priority Actions: 
Action 1:  
Create awareness and educate adults on account opening and saving, financing 
options, digital payments, microinsurance, use of agents and others; 
Action 2:  
Enhance financial literacy for regions, especially for low readiness areas,  to 
expand outreach and promote account enrollment and deepening; 
Action 3:  
Launch special financial education interventions for women, edir etc. to expand 
the outreach and promote account enrollment and deepening;  
Action 4:  
Promote conventional and Sharia complaint financial education; and 
Action 5:  
Apply conventional and sharia compliant financial consumers’ protection 
including digital financial services.

5. TARGETS & INDICATORS 
 
 
39  
5. Targets and Indicators 
Defining and quantifying financial inclusion ambition levels in a transparent, ambitious, but realistic way 
is essential for achieving clear alignment of goals among stakeholders, prioritizing efforts and tracking 
progress by setting both the demand and supply side targets and indicators. To ensure maximum 
consistency, this Strategy sets targets and progress indicators based on the defined strategic priorities 
and corresponding action programs. It follows a three-tiered approach: 
5.1. Demand Side Overall and Headline Targets 
 
Demand side overall financial inclusion target: 70% of adults reporting formal account102 
ownership have been selected as the overall financial inclusion target for the NFIS 2020. This is 
a ~25pp. increase from the current ~45% of adults formally included.  This target will be 
reached by the combined impact of the Programs and achievement of Program-level goals.103 
 
Demand side headline targets:  one for each of the identified strategic priorities (excluding two 
programs: the Key Strategic Enabler on data collection; and Foundational Program B0 on laying 
foundation for deepening), quantify the overall ambition for driving financial inclusion in the 
next five years.  The results will be compared against the findings of CSA-LSMS results and 
Global Findex.  
 
Supporting targets, where applicable, help evaluate the impact of individual actions; also, a 
larger number of additional monitoring indicators, including splits by region, gender, age and 
others, is tracked regularly. These indicators serve as a basis for designing interventions and 
understanding root causes in new developments and as an early-warning system for 
unexpected developments (See Appendix 2 for the detail). 
The below table summarizes the overall and headline targets set. Appendix 2 lists supporting indicators 
and additional monitoring indicators, and also provides details on the target-setting process. Processes 
for monitoring, evaluating and reporting progress against these targets are set out in the 
Implementation Framework that accompanies this Strategy.104 
 
 
                                                          
 
 
102 As defined by the World Bank Global Findex: Formal account ownership refers to having an account at a bank or 
another type of financial institution, or use of mobile money. (must have used the formal account in the past 12 
months to be regarded as a formal account owner). 
103 (1) Examining the current trends in financial inclusion, (2) Estimating the expected impact of the actions 
detailed in every Program, (3) Using international benchmarks to evaluate actions’ impact in other countries, and 
(4) Model the interaction of various programs to come up with a unified figure for the overall target. 
104 Program A0 and B0 are not included in the quantitative targets because they are foundational tasks

5.2. Supply side overall and headline targets 
 
Although preference is given to demand-side data,105 it may not always be readily available due to the 
lower frequency of demand-side surveys as compared to supply-side data sources. If reliable and recent 
demand-side data is unavailable, the supply-side indicators below will be used to track headline targets 
until reliable demand-side data is made available.  The data will be collected with respect to each region, 
by gender and other Indicators and used for monitoring of the progress of financial inclusion. 
 
As indicated under section 5.1, the demand side targets and indicators, the supply side also follows the 
three tiered approach to chart  targets and indictors for selected priorities and programs as summarized 
in the below table:

5.3. Supporting Indictors and Targets 
In addition to the overall and headline targets, supporting indicators are established in order to evaluate 
the impact of individual actions. Note that these indicators help assess the degree to which actions were 
effective, not primarily whether they have been executed according to plan. Additionally, these 
indicators (mostly supply-side) may be used collectively to track the Programs should there be any 
challenges with the Program data collection (mostly demand-side).  
These indicators shall be tracked annually, beginning in 2021. Appendix 2 illustrates the targets that will 
be tracked at Action level:

6. Governance Structure 
6.1. Context 
The National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) 2016 had developed a governance structure with 
representation across key institutions at various levels. It was responsible for the achievement of actions 
and targets defined in that strategy, while ensuring active coordination amongst stakeholders. The 
structure had four main units: The National Council for Financial Inclusion (NCFI) as the main decision 
making body; The Financial Inclusion Steering Committee (FISC) playing the advisory role; The Financial 
Inclusion Secretariat executing the central project management; and three Working Groups ensuring 
coordination at the implementation level.  
 
The governance structure for this NFIS 2020 leverages (and keeps) the strengths of the previous 
governance structure, and addresses identified areas for improvement in a manner that meets 
implementation requirements going forward. The details of the changes incorporated to the original 
structure are provided in the appendix. New governance units are created only where necessary to 
ensure effective project management and Strategy success.  
 
Accordingly, the overall set-up of the refreshed governance structure is similar to the original version. It 
retains the existing four main layers – Council, Steering Committee, Secretariat and Program 
Coordinators, Working Groups. However, changes are made to the composition, meeting cadence, 
operational requirements and at times structural set up of the units to address the areas for 
improvement identified. In addition, a fifth governance body – a Regional Council – will be set up for all 
regions. Overall, the governance structure is set up to effectively enable the program-based approach 
used within this Strategy.

improvement. Five important changes are incorporated: 
 
The next section details the governance structure. In addition, the separate NFIS implementation 
framework document expands on this and provides detailed roles, responsibilities, meeting cadence and 
proposed reporting and escalation measures for effective performance of the structure.  
 
The governance structure has six main units to effectively coordinate and implement this Strategy. 
Below, the role of each unit is detailed: 
 
6.2.1. National Council for Financial Inclusion (NCFI) 
The NCFI is the policy level body, accountable to the Prime Minister, with the mission to foster financial 
inclusion. Its objective is to ensure effective leadership and coordination of public and private 
stakeholders' efforts toward advancing financial inclusion in Ethiopia. The Council’s detailed roles and 
responsibilities are provided in Appendix 5 and the NFIS Implementation Framework document.

The Council is chaired by the Minister for Ministry of Finance (MOF), and the NBE Governor will be Vice 
Chairman.  It has senior level representation from key institutions: Minister, Financial Advisor to the 
Prime Minister; Minister, Ministry of Agriculture; Minister, Ministry of Innovation and Technology; 
Commissioner, Planning and Development Commission; Director General, Policy Studies Institute; Vice 
Governor for Financial Institutions Supervision representing the National Financial Inclusion Steering 
Committee. The Director of the Financial Inclusion Secretariat (FIS) serves as the secretary for the 
Council, and represents the project management arm of the Strategy.  
 
The Council convenes every three months to receive progress update on the implementation, provide 
guidance and make strategic decisions for the smooth operation of the Programs within this Strategy. 
The Council can, however, convene more times on a need-basis. Suggestions/requests to host need-
based Council meetings can come from within the Council members or the FIS, while the decision to 
host one lies with the chair and vice-chair of the Council. 
 
6.2.2. National Financial Inclusion Steering Committee (NFISC) 
The NFISC provides policy and operational advise to the NCFI, the FIS as well as the RCFI and ensures 
coordinated efforts across Programs. As such, the Steering Committee is constituted of institutions that 
have a direct impact in driving the financial inclusion agenda; the program leads and co-leads for all 
programs.  
 
Members of the Steering Committee108 comprises selected state ministers, heads of institutions and 
associations:  Ministry of Finance;  Ministry of Peace; Ministry of Agriculture;  Ministry of Education;  
Ministry of Women, Children and Youth;  Ministry of Innovation and Technology; Job Creation 
Commission; Commercial Bank of Ethiopia; Development Bank of Ethiopia; Ethiopian Insurance 
Corporation; Ethio-telecom; Federal Cooperative Agency; Federal Small and Medium Manufacturing 
Industry Promotion Authority; Federal Urban Job Creation and Food Security Agency; Agricultural 
Transformation Agency; Ethiopian Bankers Association; Association of Ethiopian Micro-Finance 
Institutions; Association of Ethiopian Insurers; EthSwitch; Financial Education and Consumers Protection 
Directorate (to be established within the NBE) and Payment Settlement system Directorate, NBE  . The 
NFISC will be chaired by the NBE Vice Governor for Financial Institution Supervision. Additional 
institutions can be invited to the steering committee on a need basis, but do not constitute the core of 
the committee. 
 
The Steering Committee meets ones in two weeks to oversee progress, provide operational and policy 
guidance and troubleshoot bottlenecks. The FIS Director serves as the secretary to the steering 
committee and is responsible for providing progress reports to the Steering Committee and guides the 
decision-making process. In addition, the FIS Head supports the Steering Committee chair in calling for 
meetings in due time.  
 
6.2.3. Financial Inclusion Secretariat (FIS) 
The FIS is the central project management unit responsible for the active coordination of the NFIS across 
all layers of the governance structure and implementing institutions. The secretariat will continue to be 
housed within the NBE, under the Vice Governor for Financial Institution Supervision. The NBE is 
responsible to provide the necessary resources for the FIS to operate effectively, and the FIS will report

the implementation of the actions of this strategy during the strategic period. 
 
47  
to the NBE on the utilization of the resources. It’s main accountability on the NFIS will, however, be to 
the NCFI. Accordingly, it will report on the progress of the strategy to the NCFI. As the main unit within 
the NFIS governance structure fully dedicated to coordinating successful implementation of the entire 
Strategy, it serves a critical role in ensuring continued momentum towards delivery and achievement of 
all programs. 
 
The Vice Governor for Financial Institution Supervision is accountable for staffing the secretariat. The 
Secretariat has eight (8) lead staff members: Director, one (1) Principal Data Expert and six (6) Principal 
Coordinators who are responsible for Programs A1, A2, A3, A4-B4, B0-B3 and C1 as provided in Appendix 
1. The coordinators and the data expert will be supported by dedicated senior experts per Program. 
Their roles are summarized as follows: 
 
FIS Director leads the secretariat and ensures its coordination roles are achieved. The Director 
is also responsible for reporting progress on the Strategy to the Council and Steering 
Committee to inform of the decision-making process. In addition, the FIS Head supports the 
Vice Governor for Financial Institution Supervision in calling and organizing Council and 
Steering Committee meetings as per defined meeting cadence.  
 
 
Data Expert is a principal level expert that mainly tracks progress of Programs and Actions 
across the Strategy, and monitors progress. In collaboration with the Program Coordinators, 
s/he is responsible for developing progress reports on Actions and targets on a monthly basis 
to inform and guide Steering Committee and Council meetings. The Expert will also be closely 
engaged in the implementation of the Key Strategic Enabler Program – Program A0, financial 
inclusion data collection, analytics, reporting and management of the webpage of FIS. 
 
 
Program Coordinators – will be responsible for the active coordination of institutions towards 
the achievement of goals for the priority Programs under this Strategy109. To ensure this, each 
Program Coordinator is responsible to call and organize their respective Program leadership 
team and working group meetings (in collaboration with respective chairs) as per the defined 
meeting cadence. They will be responsible for the implementation of action and targets in their 
respective programs. 
 
The detailed roles of the secretariat and its members are provided in Appendix 5, and the NFIS 
Implementation Plan document.  
 
6.2.4. Implementation Groups  
Program level coordination and focus is achieved through six (6) implementation groups. Each group 
force oversees the implementation of a Program within this Strategy and comprises relevant institutions 
for the implementation of the actions defined. Lead institutions for the actions across the programs are 
engaged on a need basis and do not make part of core implementation groups, to ensure lean 
operational performance. These institutions include public, private and non-governmental institutions, 
depending on the cases and the programs.   
The implementation groups and their institutional compositions are as follows: 
I. 
Program A1: Digital Payments Working Group: Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Innovation 
and Technology, Federal Cooperative Agency, the National Bank of Ethiopia (PSSD, MFISD), 
                                                          
 
 
109 In the event that the FIS is assigned the role of coordinating implementation of the National Financial Education 
Strategy, a dedicated coordinator will be assigned to oversee the NFES, supported by a relevant team.  
 
48  
Ethio telecom, Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, Eth-Switch, Association of Ethiopian Micro 
Finance Institutions (AEMFI) and the Ethiopian Bankers Association110. The NBE PSSD 
Directorate and Ethio-telecom serve as the lead and deputy lead111, respectively.  
II. 
Program A2: Regional Financial Inclusion Working Group*112: FIS, Commercial Bank of 
Ethiopia, Ethio telecom, Ethiopian Postal Services Enterprise, Association for Micro Finance 
institutions. The NBE BSD Directorate and the AEMFI serve as lead and deputy lead, 
respectively. 
 
III. 
Program A3: Women’s Financial Inclusion Working Group: Ministry of Finance, Ministry of 
Education, Development Bank of Ethiopia, Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, Association of 
Ethiopian Micro Finance Institutions, Ministry of Peace, Ministry of Women, Children and 
Youth (MOWCY), Planning and Development Commission, and Policy Studies Institute. MOF 
and MOWCY serve as the lead and deputy lead, respectively. 
i. Considering the transversal nature of gender intentional financial inclusion, the 
membership of the Women’s FI working group is structured so that at least one member 
of this group is assigned responsibility to ensure gender intentionality and effective 
coordination with one of the other program implementation groups.  
ii. Each of these individuals will receive regular progress updates from their assigned 
implementation groups and are invited to all meetings to participate. The individuals 
are, however, not required to attend all meetings for their assigned implementation 
groups. As a measure to ensure that other groups implement actions with gender 
intentionality, each of the assigned individuals from the FI for Women Group has the 
right and obligation to escalate mis-alignment with gender intentional initiatives to the 
Steering Committee, and (where necessary) the Council to seek interventions and 
guidance that ensure gender intentional implementation across Programs. 
 
IV. 
Program A4: Build Sharia Compliant Financial Access Points Working Group 
To coordinate, monitor and evaluate the programs, action and activities of sharia compliant 
access points, and products and services (Program B4), a principal coordinator will be placed 
and a working group will be set up.   This will extend to regions as well (Program A2). 
 
V. 
Deepening Programs: 
i. 
Program B0: Foundations for Deepening Working Group: National Bank of Ethiopia, 
Policy Studies Institute, Ministry of Revenue, Ministry of Agriculture, Agricultural 
Transformation Agency, Federal Small & Medium Manufacturing Industry Promotion 
Authority, Federal Cooperative Agency, Central Statistics Agency, and Association for 
Ethiopian Micro Finance Institution. The NBE MFISD Directorate and AEMFI serve as lead 
and deputy lead, respectively.  [This group convenes only until Q4 2022 and is then 
divided into three product-specific groups in parallel with initiation of programs B1 to 
B3]. 
ii. 
Program B1: Saving Working Group: Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, Ethiopian Bankers 
Association, Association of Ethiopian Micro Finance Institutions, Policy Studies Institute,

Program B3: Insurance Working Group: Ministry of Agriculture, Agricultural 
Transformation Agency, Central Statistical Agency, Ethiopian Insurance Corporation, 
Association of Ethiopian Insurers, and Association of Ethiopian Micro Finance 
Institutions. The NBE (ISD) ad MOA serve as lead and deputy lead, respectively. [This 
Group first convenes in Q1 2023]. 
v. 
Program B4: 
Drive Sharia Compliant Financial Products and Services Working Group 
To coordinate, monitor and evaluate the programs, action and activities of sharia compliant 
products and services, a principal coordinator that also coordinate Program A4 will be 
placed and a working group, composed of relevant institutions, will be set up.   This will 
extend to regions as well (Program A2). 
VI. 
Program C1: 
Financial Education and Consumers Protection-Cross programs Working Group 
On the basis of the NFES and FCP Directive, the Working Group will work together with lead Directorate 
in the NBE and ensures an ongoing awareness and financial education efforts across all programs. The 
implementation group comprises experts from MoE, FCA, AEMFI, EBA and AEI, Selected NGOs and 
financial institutions.  The group at minimum will meet monthly and reports progress of respective 
Action plans, discuss problems, risks and mitigation measures and align on cross-cutting matters. They 
will also identify issues that would need to be escalated to Steering Committees for guidance, as 
necessary. 
 
6.2.5. Regional Council for Financial Inclusion (RCFI) 
The regional council serves as an extension for the NFIS governance structure and will be rolled out to all 
regions. The details of the implementation will be defined in coordination with efforts under Program 
A2. This will include selecting members and the operating model in relation to the NFIS governance 
structure.  
 
6.2.6. Regional Task Force  
Full time Task Force for all regions will be established in collaboration with the FIS and the NBE.  Their 
functions will be defined based on the financial inclusion initiatives and designed in consultation with 
Regional Financial Inclusion Council. This ensures that the regional council is fit for purpose as a regional 
level implementation support structure complemented by regional task forces. Extension of the 
structure beyond regional level to other administrative layers (such as zone, woreda and kebele), will 
also be detailed. 
 
As detailed in Programs A2, financial inclusion efforts for regions require sustained and dedicated efforts 
and go beyond the scope of the other Programs. In particular, part of these Programs consists of the 
design, and subsequent execution, of comprehensive research agendas and strategic frameworks. 
Dedicated Task Forces will assume these tasks; in addition to the structure of ordinary implementation 
groups. The Task Forces are composed of dedicated experts and coordination teams that are to 
implement the overall program and will be housed at the Regional Finance Bureau or other units as the 
may be convenient for the region 
  
 
50  
To ensure that Actions within Programs are clearly aligned by the leadership and implementing teams at 
executing institutions, each implementation group will include leadership (director) and working level 
(expert) members from each institution. Both levels of the group can meet independently for efficient 
decision-making and working collaboration. At a minimum, however, the full group will meet at least 
once a month. This structure ensures authority to make commitments with home institutions, including 
leveraging home institution staff and resources, thereby ensuring that specific activities, including 
associated goals and targets are assigned clearly to an institution. As and where possible, at least 1/3 of 
the task force will be women to ensure inclusivity at Strategy level. This will be executed following global 
best practices. In addition to inclusivity, evidence from various studies indicates that having women 
leadership yields stronger social commitment and better operational performance.113,114 
 
For effective project implementation, the implementation groups will meet at minimum monthly. 
During the meeting, implementing institutions will report on progress of respective Action plans, discuss 
problems, risks and mitigation measures and align on cross-cutting matters. They will also identify issues 
that would need to be escalated to Steering Committees for guidance, as necessary.

7. Implementation Plan, Monitoring and Evaluation and Risk Framework 
7.1. Detailed Implementation plan 
Implementation plan for this Strategy is designed in accordance with best practices, and lessons learned 
from the implementation of the NFIS 2016. Accordingly, five key principles are leveraged to design an 
effective and efficient implementation plan that ensures successful achievement of intended targets. 
Collectively, these principles inform the design of the implementation plan for this Strategy. 
1. Specific and measurable: Actions and activities are clearly defined, with specific deliverables & 
concrete outputs marking completion and enabling effective progress measurement 
2. Achievable and result oriented: Actions within this Strategy are designed to achieve clearly 
articulated results. Action-level targets are developed considering experience and speed of 
progress in comparable countries, and are aligned with the overall and program-level targets 
3. Time bound: all Actions, activities, outputs and targets within this Strategy are mapped onto a 
single timeline, which accounts for interdependencies & priorities across the programs.  
4. Systematic: efficient and purpose driven implementation is enabled by program-based 
approach in this Strategy, where action level interdependencies are mapped, and 
implementation is focused 
5. Agile: overall implementation and governance structure is clear. It includes systematic processes 
for speedy identification of problems, clear triggers for escalation, and effective adjustment to 
changes, without disrupting workflow 
 
A separate implementation framework document accompanying this Strategy expands on the 
implementation planning with the following:  
 
Detailed governance structure charters with roles, responsibilities, and engagement models to 
ensure effective coordination for implementation 
 
Implementation plan detailing objectives, activities and output at Action, Program and overall 
Strategy level to provide a systematic guide for implementation 
 
A monitoring and evaluation framework with a clear and structured set of tracking, reporting 
and escalation measures to ensure effective progress mapping during implementation 
 
Detailed list of risks and potential mitigation measures at Action and overall Strategy level to 
help navigate potential bottlenecks during implementation 
 
Finally, a set of key steps to guide kick-off for implementation of the overall Strategy 
 
Overall, the full breadth of this Strategy will be implemented over a 5 year horizon. With anticipated 
start in Q1 2021, the implementation will be completed by Q4 of 2025. The Programs within this 
Strategy are sequenced within the five year period. To ensure effective adaptation to a changing 
ecosystem, a mid-term review of the National Financial Inclusion Strategy, including review of 
implementation progress against targets, outputs, potential unforeseen consequences, and new risks 
and opportunities will be conducted. The structure of the overall Strategy, its Programs, Actions and 
implementation may be adjusted to reflect learnings from the review. 
 
Below, a summary view of the implementation roadmap at the overall Strategy level is provided.

7.2. Monitoring and Evaluation Framework 
The robust monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system detailed in this Strategy will track strategy 
progress, identify obstacles in Strategy implementation and demonstrate the results of financial 
inclusion efforts in Ethiopia. The M&E system is comprised of three main elements:  
 
7.2.1. Enhance data collection and analytics 
Across all Programs, reliable, widely trusted, sufficiently fine-grained and regularly refreshed data on the 
state of financial inclusion in Ethiopia is essential for understanding and communicating financial 
inclusion progress, identifying barriers, designing interventions, and assessing the impact of efforts 
made. This Strategy thus defines an additional Program for expanding financial inclusion data 
capabilities. This Program identifies three priority Actions: 
1. Improve supply-side data collection by including demographic (including gender-disaggregated) 
and geospatial breakdowns  
2. Define and implement integrated analytical framework for demand-side data and optimize  
collection  
3. Create and maintain a central Financial Inclusion Database 
 
7.2.2. Strategy tracking framework:  
o 
Execution tracking will assess if implementation is on course to complete all 
actions & activities as planned, and if all scheduled outputs are available 
o 
Impact target tracking will compare progression towards quantitative targets 
against interim milestones, and gauge the impact of strategic actions on 
Financial Inclusion 
 
7.2.3. Reporting and escalation measures115 
o 
A regular reporting mechanism will provide consistent progress updates against 
targets & KPIs, with focus on new risks and opportunities 
o 
Escalation measures will provide an avenue for exception-based reporting; 
when defined targets are not reached, or might not be reached, to ensure 
mitigation efforts are carried out in time to resume implementation of the NFIS 
as planned.  
 
7.3. Mid-term Review 
To ensure effective adaptation to a fast changing and dynamic ecosystem, a mid-term review of this 
Strategy will be conducted, including assessment of implementation progresses against targets, outputs, 
potential unforeseen consequences and emerging risks and opportunities. 
 
7.4. Risk and Mitigation Measures 
The effective implementation of the NFIS 2020 will require adequate planning for potential risks and 
developing mitigation measures accordingly. Each of the actions within this Strategy has specific risks 
and mitigation measures that have been mapped at the action level. These risks and mitigation 
measures are detailed in the Implementation Framework document that accompanies this Strategy. 
                                                          
 
 
115 Note: the reporting and escalation measures provided here are indicative and will be finalized with 
key stakeholders after approval of the NFIS 2020.

Beyond Programs and their respective Actions, there are various dimensions of financial inclusion that 
are still important to monitor as they influence the outcome of the strategic objectives. 
Additional indicators for monitoring 
The table below illustrates indicators that will be monitored nationally, regionally and by gender, in 
order to provide more granular data for regulatory bodies and financial institutions to intervene in 
specific areas of interest.

118 See the Revised governance structure, under the Financial Inclusion Secretariat 
119 All the indicators should be tracked regionally. Indicators tracked by gender are all awareness, adoption and 
usage indicators, and “percentage of people living within five km of a financial access point”. 
Note: The table above illustrates the expectation of various monitoring indicators at a national level. 
These are not to be understood as targets, and overall financial inclusion success is possible even if 
development remains below expectations. Nonetheless, divergence may indicate unexpected new 
threats or developments, and may give rise to the definition of new interventions (e.g. as part of the 
mid-term review). Tracking development against the annual expectations set out below can thus serve 
as an “early-warning system”. 
 
Note further that the Emerging Region Task Force and the Gender Task Force are responsible for 
developing a framework to track these indicators by both regions and gender. This data will be used by 
the Data expert118 to analyse regional and gender disaggregated data to identify areas of improvement 
in various areas and carry out root cause analyses in the event targets are not met. This table may be 
updated with new relevant indicators, or data points, if necessary.

Financial inclusion is dependent on a number of other factors and socio-economic developments. 
Crucially, infrastructural components such as electricity and mobile network coverage are important 
drivers of awareness, access, adoption, and usage. It is important to monitor the progress of these 
indicators as constraints on potential financial inclusion interventions. The table below illustrates the 
indicators that will be monitored to aid in the root cause analysis of financial inclusion should targets not 
be met:

National ID*, Regional Development Plans*, and Telco Sector Reform* ∆. Note: Enabling Program (0) Expand and adjust existing data collection methods is not 
pictured as it covers enablement which mainly focus on the NFIS 2020 
 
Interdependencies with other initiatives have been mapped onto three distinct layers. Summary 
descriptions are provided in that section while the detailed list of strategies is provided below. 
Layer 1 – Direct Integration 
Core financial inclusion initiatives where the majority of the planned actions aim at increasing or will 
have direct impact on financial inclusion. These initiatives are recognized as major elements of the 
national financial inclusion efforts in their own rights. Their content is referenced in this Strategy, but 
not re-stated in detail unless necessary to illustrate the background for actions defined in this Strategy. 
Close implementation will be ensured, and the FIS will obtain progress updates at regular intervals.  
Initiatives included: 
1. National Digital Payments Strategy (NDPS) – Strategy to accelerate the digitization of payments 
in Ethiopia. This is expected to be a transformational driver for financial inclusion as it aims to 
rapidly proliferate mobile money usage among the low-income and rural populations. NFIS

inclusion, where the NDPS has laid regulatory and infrastructural groundwork for these 
approaches.  Therefore, the success of NDPS actions will significantly influence the rate of 
progress of Program A1. 
2. National Financial Education Strategy (NFES) – Strategy to consolidate and expand national 
initiatives for financial awareness and capability-building among the population, especially rural 
communities, low-income people, women and youth. This was a “Strategic Pillar” of the NFIS 
2016 and will be a vital success factor for the refreshed NFIS. The NFIS complements the NFES 
by providing specific and targeted education or outreach activities, usually linked to a particular 
goal (for example account enrollment and product onboarding) within many Actions across 
Programs. The success of such activities in the NFIS will rely upon the methods, resources, and 
governance structures created in the NFES. Conversely, the impact of the broad national 
awareness, education, and capability-building programs included in the NFES will be expanded 
through the NFIS by pointed projects which deepen financial education with high priority 
segments or issues. Special consideration is taken for Program A2: Drive financial inclusion in 
severely underserved areas and Program A3: Drive financial inclusion for women  
3. Rural Financial Intermediation Program (RUFIP) III – A ~$300M program launched by the 
Government of Ethiopia and International Fund for Agricultural Development of the United 
Nations (IFAD), to be implemented through the Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE). It is 
focused on increasing the capacity and functionality of rural financial institutions (MFIs and 
SACCOs), boosting levels of both rural savings mobilization and credit flow to rural populations, 
and accelerating the maturation of agricultural insurance – all of which are core drivers of 
financial inclusion. RUFIP III is the third phase of nearly twenty years of partnership which has 
been instrumental in building the MFI and RuSACCO system. NFIS will not duplicate the actions 
included in RUFIP III, but instead re-iterate key areas of strategic alignment and highlight how 
FIS and the financial inclusion governance structure can jointly work with the RUFIP apparatus to 
achieve shared goals; primarily in Program B2: expand access to financing, and also supported 
by Program A2 for FI in severely underserved areas and Programs B0 and B3 for micro-
insurance. RUFIP III is mentioned numerous times in the program descriptions and will be one of 
the most critical areas for alignment. 
Layer 2 – Major Linkages 
Initiatives where the majority of the mandate is not focused on relevant financial inclusion topics, but at 
least one key pillar or element of the initiative is focused on financial inclusion (and would have 
otherwise likely been included in NFIS). Some of these actions are listed for the NBE to implement within 
other strategies. Therefore, the NFIS includes a limited number of targeted Actions to address specific 
elements in these linked initiatives – or, for pending initiatives, alignment will be conducted once the 
initiative is released.  
Initiatives included: 
4. National Digital Transformation Strategy, “Digital Ethiopia 2025” – A broad national effort to 
digitize Ethiopia across various socio-economic dimensions. This includes Actions to enhance 
regulations to expand digital payments and mobile money as well as provide digital finance 
literacy programs, which have been assigned to the NBE. These actions are addressed and linked 
to in Program A1 
5. Plan of Action for Job Creation (PAJC) – Led by Job Creation Commission (JCC) with a strong 
focus on increasing access to credit for MSMEs, complemented in NFIS Programs B0 and B2 for 
credit 
 
66  
6. Homegrown Economic Reform Agenda (HGER) – Led by Prime Minister’s Office, it includes 
finance topics regarding agriculture, digitization, and regulations; addressed in Programs A1 
and B0 
7. Ease of Doing Business Reform Agenda (EDBR) – Led by Prime Minister’s Office and Ethiopian 
Investment Commission (EIC), it includes electronic payments covered in Program A1 and 
movable property collateral and credit information and scoring, covered in Program B0 
8. Financial Sector Reform Agenda (FSR) – Pending NBE initiative which may have implications on 
financial services market and Program A1 and B0-B3. NFIS must align with FSRA moving forward 
9. Ministry of Agriculture ten-year plan – Has a strong focus on agricultural insurance which is 
addressed within the NFIS Program B0 and B3 for micro-insurance as well as A3 for rural 
frontiers 
10. National Gender Strategy – Pending government strategy which will have mid and long-term 
implications on gender equity projects. Program A2 for women’s FI should align closely with this 
11. Development of partner-supported job growth initiatives – At least four initiatives are included 
here: The Small and Medium Enterprise Financing Program (SMEFP), Private Enterprise Program 
Ethiopia (PEPE), Financial Sector Deepening (FSD) strategy pending launch in 2021, and 
Women’s Entrepreneurship Development Program (WEDP). Other initiatives may fall into this 
category as well. These projects focus on job growth, especially in Micro, Small and Medium 
Enterprises (MSMEs), through various lenses including sectoral and gender-based. These are 
addressed through NFIS Program B0 and B2 for credit. WEDP is also strongly aligned with 
Program A2 for women’s FI 
Layer 3 – Constraints and Enablers 
These initiatives largely do not cover core financial inclusion matters as a major focus. They address 
issues which will have a major implication for financial inclusion and are typically much broader in scope 
than NFIS. These are viewed as defining boundaries for financial inclusion activities which the NFIS takes 
as underlying assumptions.  
Initiatives included: 
12. National Electrification Program (NEP) 2.0 – Led by the Ministry of Water, Irrigation, and 
Electricity (MoWIE) – specifically the Directorate of Electrification (DoE) – targeting an increase 
from 47% national access to electricity in 2019 to 100% by 2025, with off-grid access 
contribution increasing from 11% to 35%. This plan also includes elements for micro-credit via 
Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGo) solar. The progress of NEP 2.0 will be a major determinant of access 
point expansion, especially Program A1, and impact micro-credit in Program B2 
13. National Digital Transformation Strategy, “Digital Ethiopia 2025” – In addition to the digital 
finance issues previously mentioned in this Section, this initiative links to the Telco Sector 
Reform to enhance the telco network and National ID Program to establish a biometric 
universal ID, and also includes other projects (mobile phone affordability, universal access, 
cyber-security, e-Commerce, etc.). Improvements on these core infrastructure elements can be 
key to financial inclusion, especially digital financial services and geographic expansion across 
Programs but especially impacting Program A1.  
14. National ID Program – The Ministry of Revenue is leading the development and roll out of a 
biometric based national identification system to be launched in major cities by Q1 2022 and to 
cover all rural areas by Q3 2023. This will enable unique identification of individuals and is a 
strategic enabler for scaling financial inclusion and deepening.  
 
67  
15. Health Sector Transformation Plan (HSTP) II – Pending national plan for reform of the 
healthcare sector which may include refreshed elements of healthcare financing reforms and 
would have potential implications on health insurance and the financial sector (in Program B0 
and B3). Specific targets for this plan have not yet been released.  
16. Regional Development Plans – Various regional development plans may put boundaries on the 
way that financial inclusion activities can be conducted in specific regions for Program A3. 
Specific targets for these plans are not yet known  
17. Prime Minister’s Office-led initiatives (HGER and EDBR) – As previously mentioned in this 
Section, these initiatives include specific elements which are major linkages for NFIS, but other 
elements act as external determinants. EBDR includes programs for resolving insolvency 
(Federal Attorney General, Federal High Court), enforcing contracts (Federal First Instance, High 
and Supreme Courts), National ID, and electronic taxes (Ministry of Revenue); HGER includes 
reforms around capital markets and foreign exchange. All changes will have implications for 
financial sector functioning and financial services provision Programs A1, B0-B3 
18. Ten-year National Perspective Plan – Far-reaching plan by the Planning and Development 
Commission for 2020-2030 that will link strongly to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
and includes elements of agricultural transformation, industrialization, housing, etc. This follows 
the GTP II (2015/16-2019/20) and will broadly affect Program B0-B3

Appendix 4: Coordination with other governance structures  
Appendix 3 of this Strategy details the interdependency landscape this Strategy has with other strategies 
in Ethiopia, mapping varying levels of interdependency. The Program and Action-level alignments are 
detailed across this document. Below, the implementation and governance alignments are elaborated.  
Governance structure alignment can be categorized into two main groups: strategies hosted within the 
NBE and strategies hosted outside the NBE. Based on this distinction, collaboration details will vary. 
Governance structures within NBE 
The National Bank of Ethiopia houses two other strategies that have close, action-level and governance 
structure ties with this Strategy: The National Digital Payment Strategy and the National Financial 
Education Strategy. Governance-level alignments are important to ensure efficient implementation of 
Actions across the strategies. These alignments are detailed here: 
1. Coordination with the National Digital Payments Strategy (NDPS) 
The NDPS has a governance structure to oversee its implementation, with membership from various 
stakeholders. The structure has a digital payments Steering Committee and a project management unit 
(both hosted at the NBE), along with 14 working groups to coordinate implementation across 
institutions. Policy level guidance is secured through a reporting line from the Steering Committee to the 
National Council for Financial Inclusion (NCFI)131. 
The coordination of the NDPS governance structure with this Strategy’s governance structure is secured 
at three levels: 
 
Firstly, the NCFI oversees both strategies. This provides a unique opportunity to ensure policy-
level alignment, strengthen cross-institutional coordination and avoid duplication of effort. The 
Council reviews progress of both strategies when it convenes every six months. 
 
Secondly, the FIS Head sits on the Digital Payment Steering Committee. With this role, the Head 
will be able to ensure constant coordination and alignment within the NBE. 
 
Thirdly, the financial inclusion secretariat and digital payments project management unit are 
both hosted at the NBE, and coordinate on a regular basis to ensure implementation-level 
alignment  
2. Coordination with the National Financial Education Strategy (NFES) 
By design, the NFES governance structure strongly leveraged the NFIS 2016 governance structure. It 
maintained policy-level guidance through the NCFI and cross-institutional alignment and advisory 
through the Financial Inclusion Steering Committee. It also established a dedicated directorate at the 
NBE to manage the implementation of the strategy – the Consumer Protection and Financial Education 
Directorate.132 This close knit structure allows for coordinated implementation of the NFES and NFIS 
actions. Under the revised NFIS governance structure, the NFES will continue to be governed by the NFIS 
Council and Steering Committee. The NFES provides a detailed elaboration of the alignment and 
coordination with financial inclusion governance structure. 
                                                          
 
 
131 National Digital Payments Strategy, NBE, 2020 
132 National Financial Education Strategy, NBE, 2020 
 
69  
Cross-cutting for NDPS and NFES: Finally, the project management unit heads for all three strategies 
(NFIS, NDPS and NFES) will have alignment meetings every month to discuss progress identify areas of 
collaboration and proactively address areas of duplication. In addition, all three strategies report 
progress to the NCFI, together, providing senior decision makers a centralized view on progress, and 
areas for decision. However, the reporting is conducted separately (separate documents) to ensure that 
a potential variation in pace of strategies does not impact the others and progress continues 
independently. 
Coordination outside the NBE 
The coordination of the NFIS governance structure with strategies hosted outside the NBE will vary 
depending on the strength of alignment the Strategy has with the NFIS. For all external strategies, 
alignment is secured at the Council level. The Ministry of Finance and other members of the NCFI are 
represented in the governance structures of other strategies, enabling clear coordination and alignment. 
The FIS is responsible to proactively set alignment with other strategies as part of all Council meeting 
agendas. 
In addition to the alignment at the Council level, Strategies that have strong alignments with the NFIS, 
(as defined in Appendix 3 above) leverage additional coordination mechanisms. Coordination with 
RUFIP, the main Strategy with strong alignment with the NFIS outside the NBE, is secured at two 
additional levels. 
I. 
RUFIP is governed by a project Steering Committee that provides policy and strategic guidance 
and oversight to the Program133. The Steering Committee is chaired by the MOF, and has the 
NBE, FCA and DBE as members. Accordingly, MOF plays the active role of coordinating guidance 
across RUFIP and the NFIS, while other members of the RUFIP Project Steering Committee 
(represented in the NFIS governance structure) will ensure alignment at a Program level. 
II. 
The project management office for RUFIP, hosted at the DBE, is also directly engaged in the 
governance structure of the NFIS. The head of the RUFIP PMO is part of the Program 
implementation group for Program B2 (Expand access to financing). This provides for a direct 
integration at implementation level.
