The Ethiopian Parliament approved last week a budget of Birr 802bn for the 2023-
24 fiscal year, an increase of just 2 percent from the previous year. The very 
restrained spending growth presented in the new budget is positive for reducing 
the deficit and for helping lower inflation, but unfavorable spending patterns are 
becoming entrenched with rising allocations for debt service (now a quarter of total 
Government spending and a third of revenue) and falling allocations for capital 
expenditure. 
 
1. New Budget: The Federal Government budget approved by Parliament on July 6, 2023 
amounted to Birr 802 billion, equivalent to $15bn in USD terms and 7.1 percent of this 
year’s anticipated GDP. Around 65% of the Government’s overall spending is to be 
funded by domestic revenue and grants, while the remainder will be covered by 
domestic borrowing (30%) and external lenders (5%). 
 
2. Revenue: An estimated Birr 480bn is expected to be collected during the fiscal year. 
The highest share of revenue, Birr 188bn or 39% of the total, is expected to come from 
trade taxes. Direct taxes (Birr 141bn, including corporate and income taxes) are 
expected to account for 30% of revenue, while the remaining sources include indirect 
taxes such as VAT (Birr 112bn) and non-tax revenue (Birr 39bn). 
 
3. Expenditure: Expenditure is set to rise by only Birr 15bn vs the previous year. This 
reflects a level decline in capital expenditure (down by Birr 15bn or 7 percent) offset 
by a Birr 25bn increase in current expenditure and a Birr 5bn increase in subsidies to 
Regions. Continuing recent trends, capital expenditure is now just 35% of total 
expenditure despite having once taken up as much as two-thirds of total spending.  
 
4. Spending Allocation: Debt service is again the largest expenditure item in Ethiopia's 
budget, accounting for 28% of total spending and now increasingly devoted to 
covering domestic—rather than external—debt service payments. Other large 
expenditure items are: Roads (Birr 68bn, 12% of the total), Education (Birr 59bn,10%), 
Defence (Birr 50bn, 9%), and Health (Birr 23bn, 4%). 
 
5. External Financing: Of the total Birr 281bn required to finance the deficit, only 
Birr39bn ($0.7 billion) is expected from foreign borrowing (mainly from the Word Bank 
(IDA) and China EXIM Bank per breakdowns shown in the budget document). 
 
6. Domestic Financing: As was the case last fiscal year, most of the burden of financing 
the budget deficit will fall on domestic lenders, and will be met by a mix of Treasury 
Bills (bought mainly by the state bank and pension funds), Treasury Bonds (purchased 
by private banks in amounts equal to 20% of their gross lending) and Direct Advances 
(borrowing from the central bank). The precise mix of funding to be utilized from these 
three domestic funding sources is not given in the budget, but relying much more 
heavily on the first two alternatives would be key to reducing inflation this fiscal year. 
At the same time, if external funding inflows turn out higher than is currently assumed 
in the budget—as would be the case with an IMF/WB program and external debt 
service relief—this would sharply reduce the burden faced by domestic lenders and 
bring much better prospects for improved banking system credit to the private sector.

Overview: Budget Assumptions and Headline Numbers  
 
• 
The Ethiopian Government estimates that GDP will grow by 7.9% in this fiscal year, reflecting the end 
of the recent conflict, favorable rains that should boost crop output, and a gradual re-engagement 
with external partners. The Government budget expects inflation to average 24 percent for the 2023-
24 year, while import growth (critical in determining trade tax performance) is projected at 19% for 
the year.

Budgetary Figures Relative to GDP: 
 
• 
Seen relative to nominal GDP, the budget's revenue and expenditure figures are both unusually low 
at just 4.6% of GDP and 7.1% of GDP, respectively. Besides a possible over-estimation of the nominal 
GDP denominator, these ratios point to large segments of the economy remaining outside the formal 
sector and the exclusion of many economic activities from the tax net (most notably for agriculture). 
Relative to non-agriculture nominal GDP, the revenue ratio is closer to 8 percent and the expenditure 
ratio is near 12 percent.

Budgetary Growth Rates:  
 
• 
The approved budget of Birr 802 bn is a growth of only 2% in nominal terms compared to the budget 
expenditure plan of last year. This represents a negative real growth of more than 20%, due to the 
forecast inflation rate of around 24%. Revenue (excluding grants) is expected to increase by 27% as 
compared to last year's budget, and by 9% as compared to the expected outturn. Grants are expected 
to increase by 33%, as external partners and donors have started to re-engage with the Government. 
 
• 
Looking at the composition of total expenditure changes, the minimal increase in total spending 
reflects in large part to a 7% decline in capital expenditures (investments in roads, infrastructure, 
education, and other long-term projects). The share of capital expenditure in the federal budget has 
fallen from 54% five years ago to 35% in fiscal year 2023/24. This is the lowest share of budget 
allocated for capital investments by the federal Government in a decade and threatens long-term 
growth if not eventually reversed or replaced by much higher private investment.

Revenue Trends and Composition:  
 
• 
The overall revenue outturns for fiscal year 2022-23 is expected to reach 85% of the set budget. Tax 
revenue exceeded the budget figure by 2%, reaching 87% of the target. Non-tax revenue also 
recovered from the conflict impact, reaching 75% of the budget. External grants achieved 79% of the 
budget.  
 
• 
The budget revenue for FY 2023-24 is estimated to be Birr 480bn (about $9 bn). Of this, 85%, or Birr 
440 bn, is expected to come from tax revenues, which remains very low in Ethiopia compared to other 
countries in sub-Saharan Africa. This reflects the country's large informal economy and the low tax 
compliance rate; moreover, the shocks the economy faced in the past few years have 
disproportionately affected tax paying sectors.  
 
• 
The specific revenue targets set in the budget, across 17 main sub-categories and 163 detailed line-
items are presented in Table 7. These revenue targets reflect a number of on-going reforms to raise 
the tax base, including by increasing the number of tax collectors and bringing more businesses and 
individuals into the formal economy.

budgetary spending were in allocations for trade and industry (up 23%), transport and communication 
(up 20%), agriculture (up 17%), and health (up 17%).

Expenditure Quality: Poverty-Reducing Expenditure, Wages, and Government Capital Expenditure  
 
• 
The share of expenditure on poverty-reduction (mainly in education, health, road etc), has continued 
to decline, at 57% of the total expenditure versus the 75% share five years ago. This partly reflects the 
rising share of spending allocated to covering debt repayments and the priority given to covering such 
outstanding obligations.  
 
• 
The specific expenditure allocations put forth in the budget, across 18 main sub-categories and 227 
detailed line-items are presented in Table 12.

Overall Financing of the Budget 
• 
As noted earlier, the budget deficit of 281 billion birr (around 2.4% of GDP) will be covered mostly 
from domestic borrowing (86% of the total financing). The foreign funding of Birr 39bn (0.3% of GDP) 
is among the lowest levels seen in recent years, and compares to a high seen in 2019-20, when 70 
percent of the budget was covered by external financing.

External Financing Trends for the Budget 
• 
The Ethiopian Government is anticipating budgetary grants of Birr 41 bn (~ $770 mn) with the sources 
of these grants mainly being the World Bank, the EU, the AfDB, the UK, and the US. 
• 
The Government is also expecting external budgetary borrowing of Birr 39bn (~$731 mn) in the 2023-
24 fiscal year. The majority of these borrowings are expected to come from the World Bank, with 
some limited bilateral loans from countries such as China, Saudi Arabia, and Italy.

Ethiopia’s Budget Deficits and Debt in a Cross-Country Context:  
 
• Ethiopia's public debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 39% at the end of March 2023, which is far below the 
average of 66% for African countries and 69% for emerging markets. This indicates that Ethiopia's debt 
burden is relatively manageable. However, the debt service to exports ratio (77% versus SSA of 20%) 
and the debt service to revenue ratio (31% versus SSA of 17%) are both high, given the country’s still 
low export and revenue base.
