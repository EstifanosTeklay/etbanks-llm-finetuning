SUMMARY Recent Developments and Year-Ahead Outlook Contrary to most expectations following the onset of the COVID pandemic, Ethiopias macro data for the just ended fiscal year showed better-than-expected outturns in many areas, including in tax collections, bank lending, exportairline receipts, and industrial park activity. At the same time, still-high inflation, fx shortages, and reduced activity in a few COVID-affected sub-sectors remain key challenges. For the new fiscal year, though the outlook is clouded by uncertainties on the politicalelections front, we see good prospects for this years crop harvest thanks to above-average rains, a positive momentum in exports coffee, flowers, gold, and services, stronger support from external partners grants, loans, debt service relief, and encouraging prospects for FDI due to imminent privatizations. In addition, the recently passed budget will be supportive of key domestic growth drivers given rising infrastructuresocial spending, while the launch of a new Ten- Year Plan this year should bring with it a number of major Government, PPP, and private projects. Overall, as long as there are no major domestic disturbances that hinder normal economic activities, we think growth of 5 to 6 percent is a realistic prospect, as is a gradual improvement in fx conditions over the course of the year.

On the positive front, the final annual crop estimate released by the Ministry of Agriculture in April 2020 showed growth of 6.2 percent, with the three most important cropswheat, teff, and maizeup by 10, 6, and 2 percent respectively. Beyond agriculture, several activity indicators point to economic expansion, including tax collections up 18 percent for the year despite a weak final quarter, bank deposits up 16 percent, bank lending up 29 percent, exports up 12 percent in USD terms, industrial park production, electricity generation, telecom subscribers, ECX commodity trading, and shipping line cargo activity. By contrast, there were areas of weak activity with respect to FDI inflows down 19 percent, tourist arrivals down 29 percent, and imports down 8 percent. Taking into consideration all of the above, we estimate last years growth outturnto be released in the coming monthsto show overall real GDP growth of near 6 percent, based on sector growth rates of 4 percent for agriculture, 11 percent for industry, and 4 percent for services. Investment Indicators of investment activity for the year as a whole remained mixed, with negative outturns in some private sector indicators alongside positive trends for public sector investment measures. The main weak areas continued to be seen in FDI inflows, which were down about 19 percent for the year 2.5bn vs 3.1bn and in overall capital imports excluding aircraft, which is suggestive of trends in domestic private sector investment. Based on state enterprise borrowing up 14 percent, their investments have likely increased over the past year, while government capital expenditureper budget data was up 9 percent for the year. Overall, reflecting the above developments, we estimate investment has fallen slightly to around 34 percent of GDP for the year vs a 35.2 percent of GDP level reported in last years GDP statistics. Inflation After a short-lived improvement to 19.8 in May 2020, inflation has reversed course and shown an increasing trend in the two most recent months 21.5 in June and 22.3 in July. As before, a few line-items are driving most of the price increases, particularly vegetables prices up 36 percent, grain cereals up 23 percent, and housingutilities up 22 percent had these three items shown no price increases, overall inflation would have been only 10 percent. The lagged impacts of some administrative policy measures continue to have an impact excise taxes on beer have contributed to 29 percent beverages inflation year-on-year electricity bill adjustments are still feeding into higher inflation for the housingutilities line-item and taxi fare hikes in Aprilto adhere to social distancing rulescontributed to a large 70 percent increase in transport prices from year-ago levels. Ethiopias inflation record RESEARCH ANALYTICS Disclaimer This report represents solely the views, analysis, and judgement of the Cepheus research team and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Funds Managing Partners, Advisors, or Investors. 3 continues to be an outlier in both an African and global context only about ten other countries show 20-plus inflation, and inflationary pressures during the pandemic have failed to decline 22 percent now or same as at end-March, though post-COVID inflation has trended downward in many African and emerging markets following sharp drops in domestic demand. Monetary policy Growth in base money supply has jumped sharply in June 2020 up 23 percent year-on-year vs a planned growth of 12.5 percent, reflecting the fiscal and monetary stimulus enacted in response to the Corona pandemic. Virtually all of the growth in reserve money took place in the last two quarters of the fiscal year and has not yet translated into similar rates of broad money growth. Indeed, broad money growth has slowed for the year as a whole, rising by just 17 percent year-on-year as of June 2020 versus growth rates of 20-25 percent in 2018-19 and near 30 percent in 2017-18. Banking developments Commercial bank deposits grew at their slowest rate in a decade, or by 16 percent last year versus average annual growth of 28 percent over the prior ten years. Deposits have reached Birr 1.043 trillion, with 57 percent of this total at public banks and 43 percent at private banks. Total financing provided by the banking system loans plus banks holdings of corporate bonds, NBE Bills, and T-Bills reached an estimated Birr 1.069 trillion at end-June 2020, up around 22 percent for the year and equivalent to 102 percent of total banking system depositspointing to still-tight liquidity positions at most banks. Based on monetary data, the private sector remained the main beneficiary of last years lending growth, with an estimated Birr 127bn of the Birr 213bn net credit increase roughly 60 percent going to private borrowers as opposed to Government or SOEs.1 In terms of other banking indicators, the sector registered 18 percent growth in assets, 12 percent growth in total capital to Birr 125bn, and 16 percent growth in branches to 5,965 nation-wide branches as of June 2020 or an increase of around 800 branches in the fiscal year. For the large state bank, CBE, activity indicators are showing a moderation in growth trends, with deposits only up 10 percent and lending up 23 percent from year-ago levels. By contrast, private banks saw 25 percent deposit growth and have collectively been expanding their lending at a rapid rate, or by 34 percent from year-ago levels. Boosted by these trends, year-total profits at the 16 private banks rose to record high levels, up 24 percent from year-ago levels and reaching Birr 17bn on a pre-tax basis. By our calculations, and using provisional profit figures from bank surveys, the private banking sectors average earnings per share EPS was 31.5 percent in FY 2019- 20, only slightly lower than the 32.7 percent EPS average in 2018-19 and the 33.0 percent EPS average for the past decade. 1 Of the Birr 213bn net increase in domestic credit shown in monetary data, Birr 27bn reflected Government borrowing while Birr 186bn was non-Government borrowing. Excluding an estimated Birr 59bn in borrowing by SOEs from bond issuance data, the residual Birr 127bn would represent the increase in credit to the private sector for the 2019-20 fiscal year.

Revenue collections actually fell in the last quarter of the year April-June 2020, with that quarters outturn showing a decline of 4 percent vs the same period last year. Had the same pace of revenue growth 25 percent been maintained in the last quarter as observed in the prior nine months, we estimate Q4 revenue would have been Birr 66 bn rather than the Birr 50bn actual outturn the Birr 16bn shortfall shows the adverse revenue impact brought about so far by the Corona pandemic. For the year as a whole, taxes on domestic activity showed modest growth of just 7 percent, but this was offset by large increases in trade taxes up 35 percent, boosted in part by the depreciated exchange rate which increases the Birr value of customs collections even in the midst of negative growth in USD imports. Comprehensive budget data including both expenditure and deficit outturns is not yet available for the full fiscal year but, by our estimate, the deficit outturn is likely to reach near Birr 95bn, or 2.8 percent of GDP, reflecting increased expenditures in the final quarter for Corona related outlays and assistance to increased numbers of vulnerable groups. Debt Public debt rose to 54.7bn as of March 2020, up by about 1bn net from June 2019. Relative to the estimated GDP for FY 2019-20 Birr 3,427bn or USD 108.5bn, public debt-to-GDP now stands at 54 percent, a near 10 percentage points drop from June 2018 when the ratio peaked at 59 percent of GDP. Looking only at external debt, this now stands at 25.5 percent of GDP, also a major drop from its peak of 31 percent seen in June 2018. Trade Exports performed surprisingly well even in the midst of the global pandemic, and rose by 12 percent despite projected world export growth of only 3 percent this year. Per industry informationand especially for flowers as well as coffeeEthiopias strong export results partly reflect a drop in the exports of competitor countries and their inability to maintain as Ethiopia did critical supply chains and continued airshipping links to their export markets. In dollar terms, the top performing export products were coffee 856mn for the year and up 12 percent, flowers 422mn, up 65 percent, oilseeds 345mn, down 11 percent, chat 324mn, up 7 percent, pulses 235mn, down 30 percent and gold 197mn, up six-fold from last year reflecting improved NBE incentives for local gold producers. Ethiopias three main manufactured exports showed mixed results, with textile product exports growing by 10 percent to 169mn, while leather product exports declined 39 percent to 72mn and processed meat exports fell 24 percent to 67mn. With respect to import trends, the 8 percent decline for the year has now brought imports to their lowest levelrelative to GDPin over 20 years, or just 12.8 percent of GDP last year vs 25 percent of GDP five years ago. Sharp drops in imports were seen for fuel down 20 percent due to lower global oil prices, aircraft imports down 92 percent, and durable consumer goods down 23 RESEARCH ANALYTICS Disclaimer This report represents solely the views, analysis, and judgement of the Cepheus research team and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Funds Managing Partners, Advisors, or Investors. 5 percent. Exceptions to the generally negative growth rates seen for most import categories were seen for fertilizers up 20 percent, agricultural capital equipment up 51 percent and cereal grains up 41 percent. Balance of payments BOP Data for the first nine months of the fiscal year latest available figures showed a trade deficit of around 9.1bn, which was only partly offset by 5.1bn in private remittances and official transfers, resulting in a current account deficit of around 4bn. In the capital account, total fx inflows were near 2.8bn, reflecting 1.9bn in FDI inflows, 1.3bn in net government borrowing, and 0.6bn in SOE external loan repayments. Reflecting the net impacts of the above, foreign exchange reserves fell by close to 1bn in the nine months to March 2020. Though BOP data are not available for the full fiscal year, the fx reserves figure seen in monetary data reveal a subsequent jump in fx reserves during the last quarter of the fiscal year, bringing the end-June 2020 fx reserves stock to 3.2bn, equivalent to 2.8x monthly imports and around 1.6x annual external debt service dues. Exchange rate The Birrs depreciation is continuing at a measured but significant pace. Compared to year-ago levels, the Birr is now 21 percent depreciated versus the US Dollar. The pace of depreciation was even larger almost 30 percentagainst the Euro and the UK Pound, indicating larger rate adjustments versus two significant trading partners who collectively make up a quarter of Ethiopias trade. With an average exchange rate movement of 50 cents per month since the start of 2020, the resulting rate of annual depreciation is now equal to recent year-on-year inflation rates both near 20 percent, suggesting the central banks exchange rate policy seeks to at least maintain a constant real effective exchange rate REER that can prevent a deterioration in external competitiveness. Sovereign bond and Market Ratings Ethiopias sole international sovereign bond showed a drop in yields since its peak of 10.1 percent seen in early May. The latest yieldindicative of the interest rate needed to attract lenders stands at close to 7 percent, and broadly follows a reduction in yields seen for many frontier and emerging markets over the past few months the 3 percentage points drop in Ethiopias yield broadly matches the drop seen in average emerging market, EMBI, yields. With respect to the rating agencies, Moodys downgraded Ethiopias rating from B1 to B2 with a negative outlook during the past quarter while the other two main rating agenciesStandard and Poors and Fitch Ratingshave kept in place their B credit ratings.

Also, exogenous factors at the start of the fiscal year are turning out to be supportive, with above- average kiremt rains during June to August and improving prospects that global economic conditions turn positive as we move towards 2021. Overall, as long as there are no major domestic disturbances that impede normal economic activities, we think growth of 5 to 6 percent is a realistic prospect for the new fiscal year. After years of tight constraints, foreign exchange conditions could show a decisive improvement this year. A sizeable depreciation 20 vs the USD and near 30 vs the EuroSterling, rising exports, and a sharp import compression have already reduced the trade deficit to its lowest level in over a decade. Assuming a continuation of the recent export momentum, still favourable commodity prices, a quick recovery in airline revenues, rising grantsloans, and record privatization-driven FDI inflows all plausible prospects at this point, the foreign exchange outlook should brighten markedly this fiscal year, helping boost reserves to record levels and improving fx supplies to the private sector over the course of the year. Overview GDP growth Growth prospects this year are generally promising, in our view, given the outlook for three large sectorsagriculture, construction, and wholesaleretail tradethat account for the bulk of Ethiopias GDP. Corona- related impacts, limited to a comparatively small sub-set of the economy 20 of GDP, should fade out during the course of the year as stimulus measures provide an offset, as the external environment gradually improves, and as economic actors adjust to living with the new post-COVID reality. Looking at the main specific sectors, the following prospects are noteworthy o For agriculture 36 of GDP, a very favourable rainy season suggests a better harvest outturn than last year, despite initial fears that input availability and locust infestations might lead to a drop in agricultural production. Rainfall data from the National Meteorological Agency point to average rainfall levels that are 14 percent higher than last year which was an already favourable year with a record crop output, and virtually all areas of the country have been designated as having average of above-average rains for this rainy season. Judging from import data and RESEARCH ANALYTICS Disclaimer This report represents solely the views, analysis, and judgement of the Cepheus research team and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Funds Managing Partners, Advisors, or Investors. 7 Ministry of Agriculture notices, fertilizer distribution to farmers has been broadly favourable. Land under cultivation is also likely to increase given extensive policy efforts to leave no plots uncultivated across all regions. Considering the combination of these three factorsgood rains, good fertilizer supplies, and improved acreagewe view the Governments 6 percent agriculture growth projection as reasonable. Even if one accounted for some potential shocks in the period ahead, such as localized locust infestations and disruptions to normal harvesting activity in some areas, agricultural growth of 4 to 5 percent remains a realistic prospect, implying a total crop output of 350mn quintals or more this year vs 335mn quintals last year. o With respect to the construction sector 20 GDP, as public sector projects continue to drive a large part of the activity in this area, the budget this year should be strongly supportive given increased allocations for roads, irrigation projects, agriculture, and social sectors such as health and education Aggregate spending on these five sub- sectors alone, each with large domestic impacts, will be Birr 166bn, and a 20 percent increase from last year. Off-budgetary public sector housing projects coming on line this year should also provide further stimulus. On the private sector side, current high demand for cement and steel rebars as well as the 35 percent growth in recent bank lending to housingconstruction suggests continued on-going expansion in this segment. Growth in the high single-digits, even perhaps in the low teens, is thus possible for this sector in FY 2020-21, in our view. o For wholesale and retail trade 14 of GDP, this sector might face COVID-related drops in activity in certain sub-segments in the first part of the fiscal year, but as most of the activity in this area reflects non- discretionary items trading of basic food crops, consumer goods, exportsimports, and retail, the sectors overall growth rate should not deviate too far from trends in agriculture, exports, and imports. Thus, we would expect low to mid-single digit growth in this sector. o Other sub-sectors that should register positive growth this year reflecting either rising government spending, demographics, still-low starting bases andor more favourable policiesinclude public administration which makes up 3.4 of GDP, education 3.4 of GDP, health 1.1 of GDP, financial services 3.3 of GDP and mining less than 1 of GDP. o With respects to downside risks, political and election-related tensions during the fiscal year could clearly hold back growth in non-agricultural sectors especially manufacturing and some services if disturbances impair normal economic and trading activities. Moreover, a very slow recovery in the global economy could result in low FDI inflows, while RESEARCH ANALYTICS Disclaimer This report represents solely the views, analysis, and judgement of the Cepheus research team and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Funds Managing Partners, Advisors, or Investors. 8 difficulties in securing needed financing for the government budget due to potential revenue shortfalls, lower external loans, constrained domestic funding or delayed privatization may reduce government spending and thus hold back the public sector related drivers of GDP growth. These are not our baseline assumptions or expectations, but represent notable risks. o Overall GDP growth Considering all of the above, we expect GDP growth will be around 5.5 percent for FY 202021. The Government expects growth of 8.5 percent, as reflected in the budget, while external forecasters show lower expectations as a whole. Our compilation of forecasts by seven external institutions suggests a consensus view of 5.0 percent growth for this year. Inflation With respect to the inflation outlook, as we attribute the recent JuneJuly inflation readings to temporary factors, we expect a gradual improvement for the rest of the year. Inflation had declined to 19.8 percent in May 2020 and was on a downward course untilit appearsdomestic unrest in JuneJuly affected supply chains for key food items and temporarily worsened inflation. In our view, these factors are unlikely to persist in the coming months and we thus anticipate a gradual fall in price pressures for the rest of the year, especially following the SeptemberOctober harvest of the main food crops. Assuming only two more months of positive month-on- month inflation, until the annual crop harvest reach food markets, and working with negative monthly inflation thereafter in line with historical norms, inflation on a year-on-year basis could fall to 16 percent by December 2020 and 10 percent by June 2021. On a year-average basis, this would translate to 16 percent inflation for this fiscal year as a whole. Fiscal policy and debt As highlighted in our recent Budget Review note, fiscal policy this year is set to be expansionary in several respects, with planned expenditure of Birr 476bn funded by Birr 350bn in revenue and grants as well as Birr 126bn 3 of GDP of net new borrowing. The budget will include large spending increases in roads, education, agriculture, health and educationall of which should help drive expansion in large economic sub- sectors. The level of new domestic borrowing anticipated in the budget is large Birr 78bn, but can be manageable if split broadly among banks, NBE, pension funds and some use of privatization proceeds. Some diversion of domestic funding away from the private sector is unavoidable this year as Treasury Bill placements by the government will likely rise substantially. Given last years strong increase in credit to the private sector, and assuming the high allocation of domestic funds to the public sector is limited to this year, credit supplies to the private sector should not be adversely affected over the medium-term. With respect to debt ratios, the Government debt- to-GDP ratio is unlikely to deteriorate much given the large growth in nominal GDP. In terms of overall public sector debt, including SOE borrowing, this RESEARCH ANALYTICS Disclaimer This report represents solely the views, analysis, and judgement of the Cepheus research team and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Funds Managing Partners, Advisors, or Investors. 9 should end the year around 57 percent of GDP, only slightly above the estimated 54 percent of GDP ratio as of June 2020. However, two measures of the countrys debt service burden show still heavy demands on domestic resources annual government debt service will be 11 percent of revenue grants Birr 37bn vs Birr 350bn, while annual external public sector debt service of around 2bn excluding any potential debt service relief will be equivalent to roughly 60 percent of the countrys foreign reserves stock as of June 2020. Monetary developments and banking As the monetary policy stance has been loosened in response to the COVID pandemic, high rates of reserve and broad money growth will persist up to at least the end of 2020. Though broad money growth was only 17 as of June 2020, this will likely rise in the coming quarters as domestic financing requirements of the budget call for substantial net borrowing from the central bank and from commercial banks. One consequence of such expanded government borrowing will be less growth in credit to the private sector, which is likely to moderate to near 15-20 percent or less versus an estimated 25 percent last year given the large claims on domestic funds by the public sector. On the regulatory front, gradual reforms measures being undertaken by the central bank should continue to support financial sector activity and expansion notable measures in this context include recent liquidity support, generous provisioning rules which have helped companiesbanks cope with COVID impacts, a planned loosening of rules enabling banks to borrow from abroad, and the opening of the sector to expected new players such as additionalspecialized banks, MFIs-turned- banks, fin-tech start-ups, payment service providers andfollowing regulatory changescapital market service providers. Balance of payments With respect to the balance of payments, we anticipate a strong improvement in foreign exchange conditions this year, aided in part by the already sizeable external adjustment underway 20-plus percent depreciation and record-low trade deficit as well as the favourable outlook for global commodity markets low oil prices, high coffeegold prices. For the year ahead, we see goods exports reaching 3.4bn 14 percent growth from last year, services exports at 4.9bn a 5 percent increase, remittances at 5.4bn a modest 3 percent increase, and official grants of 1.8bn. On the capital account, we expect FDI will reach 4bn, supported by privatization transactions, while net government borrowing of near 1.5bn will further boost fx supplies some improvement on the private capital account is also likely as rules are loosened on foreign borrowing by both domestic firms and local banks. Reflecting these developments, we project the fx reserves stock at the end of the fiscal year will comfortably pass 4bn, up significantly from the 3.2bn stock as of June 2020. These increased net balance of payments inflows should allow for improved fx supplies to the private sector over the course of the year.

We assume the annualized depreciation near 20 percent observed for the last three consecutive months will be continued by the central bank as long as inflation remains in that range, and thus see monthly depreciations of around 50 cents per month to the end of the fiscal year. Accordingly, we see the exchange rate at close to 38 BirrUSD by end-December 2020 and just under 41 BirrUSD by June 2021.

The increase in crop volumes reflects a slight increase in acreage farmed 12.8mn hectares in FY 2019-20 vs 12.7mn hectares a year earlier together with notably better yields 26.1 quintals per hectare last year vs 24.8 quintals per hectare the prior year. A detailed breakdown of the crop data reveals strong growth in the three main cereal grainsmaize, teff, and wheat that make up nearly two thirds of total agricultural production. Other large crops such as sorghum and barley also showed positive growth. Among other categories, pulsesbeans as a group showed virtually no growth while oilseeds mainly sesame grew by over 7 percent reflecting mainly an improvement in the sesame harvest after poor results in the prior year.

Notable declines in performance were seen for foreign direct investment down 19 percent and tourist arrivals down 29 percent. With respect investment, indicators for last year were mixed rising public sector investment was seen for SOEs and government based on bond issuance data and government capital spending figures, but at the same time there was a decline in investment by foreign investors per FDI data and also by domestic private investors judging by the small fall in capital goods imports excluding aircraft.

Actual rainfall data for the month of July 2020 shows increased levels vs last year for most parts of the country, and an average 14 percent higher rainfall level this year versus last year. Reflecting a strong anticipated crop output, on-going growth in construction which is the dominant portion of the industry sub-sector, and only a gradual service sector recovery reflecting Corona impacts in the first half of 2020-21, we expect real GDP growth to be near 5.5 percent this year.

PRICES AND INFLATION Recent Developments and Outlook Inflation outturns After falling to 19.8 in May 2020, inflation reversed course and rose to 21.5 in June 2020 and to 22.3 in July 2020. Both domestically produced goods as well as domestic services are showing high inflationaround 22 percent while imported inflation is noticeably lower at around 8 percent. The few items showing price declines included sugar, education, and telecom services.

After accounting for the weights of specific products in the inflation index, the largest contributors to inflation were vegetables, bread and cereals, and housing and utilities, with these items contributing 4.4, 3.9 and 3.6 percentage points respectively or more than half of the observed 22 percent year-on-year inflation. A more detailed look at price level data for Addis Ababa shows inflation in urban areas being driven by significantly higher rents up 30, higher transport prices up 100, and higher food prices especially for teff, edible oil, onions, and spices.

The latest month-on-month inflation rates of 2 percent imply annualized inflation of more than 24 percent if price pressures continue at this pace. Looking ahead, as we attribute the high m-o-m inflation of JuneJuly 2020 to temporary factors supply disruptions and disturbances in those months, we expect the month-on- month rates should moderate to around 1 percent each in August and September 2020, followed by negative m-o-m rates thereafter as crop harvests begin to reach food markets. On this basis, we expect inflation to be around 16 percent by end-2020 and in the low teens for the first half of 2021.

Net foreign assets of the banking system shrunk during the year and contributed to the slower expansion in money supply. Broad money growth is continuing to moderate, moving from annual growth rates of near 30 percent two years ago and 20-25 percent last year, to 17 percent as of June 2020. By contrast, the deceleration seen in reserve money growth is now reversed and could bring further inflationary pressures if prolonged.

The share of financing going to the private sector is up to an estimated 37 percent as of March 2020, up from 35 two years ago. Bank loans by sectors Industry, exports, construction, and domestic trade continue to be the four largest sectors receiving bank loans. Among large loan categories, growth rates were fastest for construction, exports, and industry. Outstanding bond issuances State enterprise bond issuance was minimal in the first half of the fiscal year but rose by Birr 48bn as of March 2020, an increase of 14 percent from June 2019.

CBE has seen a moderation in deposit growth to near 10 percent, while private banks have collectively boosted their deposits by 25 percent and their loan books by 34 percent. FISCAL POLICY Recent developments Revenue performance Revenue was up 18 percent for the year, despite a major COVID related shock in the last quarter of the year. Excluding COVID impacts, revenue was rising by 25 percent year-on-year in the first nine months of the year. Revenue impacts from COVID were pronounced in the last quarter of the FY April-June 2020, which showed a 4 percent drop in tax collections from year-ago levels. Revenue for the last quarter turned out to be just Birr 50bn, though pre-COVID trends suggested it would reach Birr 66bn. The Birr 16bn shortfall roughly 0.5 percent of GDP is an indication of the quarterly revenue impact of the COVID pandemic to date.

We estimate the deficit will end the year at near Birr 95 bn or 2.8 percent of GDP, given COVID related impacts on revenue and spending. Public debt, in USD terms Outstanding public sector debt has risen by 1bn since the start of the fiscal year, and stands at 54.7bn as of March 2020 slightly more than half of public debt is now owed to external creditors. Public debt, relative to GDP Relative to GDP, public debt is down sharply from 59 percent two years ago to 50 percent as of March 2020 given our estimated nominal GDP of Birr 3,427bn or 108.5bn for FY 2019-20. External debt stocks External debt has remained at around 25.5 percent of GDP since Dec 2019. Only 60 percent of external debt is owed by the Government, with the remainder owed by state enterprises.

Services and remittance inflows of 5.1bn only partly offset the trade deficit, so the current account deficit outturn was 4bn during this period. Notable declines in current account receipts were seen for service exports reflecting a slowdown in Ethiopian Airlines and tourist activities and also for remittances, which were down 5 percent in the nine-month period. With a current account deficit of 4bn and total capital inflows of around 3bn, the resulting BOP deficit was near 1bn for the nine month period this was roughly the decline seen in fx reserves between June 2019 3.4bn and March 2020 2.5bn. FX reserves Fx reserves data available to June 2020 show central bank reserves rising to 3.2bn in the last quarter of the FY, or just a 200mn drop from year-ago levels. After declining in the first half of the fiscal year, gross commercial bank fx reserves improved significantly in the last two quarters and ended the year are near 1bn, roughly similar to year- ago levels.

At sixth place, gold exports rose to near 200mn for the year, a six-fold increase from the prior year thanks to more market-based pricing policies put in place by the central bank. The three main manufactured exportstextiles, leather products, and meatshowed mixed results, with positive growth registered for textiles but declines seen in the other two categories Eight export products showed growth of at least 10 percent during the year. Besides the exceptional performance of gold, notable growth rates were seen for flowers up 65 percent, electronic exports mainly assembled phones and up 24 percent, and electricity exports up 23 percent. Oilseeds and pulses both down 11- 14 percent are both large-value export products that continue to hold back overall export performance. A recovery in these two items could raise Ethiopias export growth to well above 20 percent.

Boosted by rising prices since March 2020, monthly coffee exports have been averaging 90- 100mn in recent months. Monthly industrial park exports halved from 14mn to 7mn between February and April 2020, as the global impact of the COVID pandemic sharply reduced foreign demand. However, a tentative recovery appears to be taking hold, with exports now reaching 10mn per month. Among industrial parks, Hawassa with 73mn annual exports, Bole Lemi 44mn, and Eastern Industrial Park 15mn continue to be the largest exporters, accounting for 80 percent of total industrial park exports. The Kombolcha, Mekelle, Huajian, and Adama industrial parks each exported between 4mn and 9mn for the year.

Imports excluding these two categories rose slightly by 1 percent. Consumer goods imports fell by 6 percent reflecting in part the sharp depreciation over the course of the year. Within consumer goods, notable drops were seen for car imports, non- cereal food imports, and other discretionary consumer imports. While capital goods imports fell overall by 18 percent, particular categories such as industrial capital goods and agricultural capital goods showed positive growth.

The trade deficit has improved considerably thanks to the decline imports as a share of GDP. The trade deficit is now only 10 percent of GDP, compared to a 20 percent of GDP five years ago and 15 percent just two years ago. The import compression and associated fall in the trade deficit is facilitating Ethiopias external adjustmentreducing the current account deficit and associated external vulnerabilities.

The Birr showed only a 6 percent annual depreciation rate in July 2019, but this has risen steadily during the course of the fiscal year and the currency is now moving at an annualized depreciation rate of near 22 percent. After declining in late 2019, and despite the 20 percent depreciation in the official rate since then, the gap between the official and parallel market exchange rates has stabilized at around 25 percent in the last few months.

Among Africas 10 largest economies, the Birr has shown the second highest rate of depreciation on a year-on-year basis. However, as Ethiopias inflation rate is much higher than that in virtually all of the comparator countries shown, the Birrs real effective change rate has not depreciated by as much as the nominal depreciation figures shown here. Seen against other currencies besides the USD, the Birr shows even higher depreciation rates of near 30 percent against both the Euro and Pound. Given that the Birr is priced relative to the dollar, this reflects the dollar's depreciation versus the EuroPound, which further magnifies the Birr's depreciation rate relative to those two major currencies. All else equal, exports to those trading partners are even becoming even more competitive while imports from those markets are becoming less attractiveaffordable.

In addition, expectations of further Birr depreciation have moderated in the most recent quarter, with only 20 percent expecting an adjustment of more than 20 percent while around 80 percent expect the depreciation to be only up to 20 percent over the next six months. With respect to views on the Birrs fair value, the majority of respondents 53 percent now believe that a depreciation of up to 10 percent is sufficient to take the Birr to its fair value, while another 32 percent view an added 10-20 percent adjustment is warranted to reach fair value.

We thus see a monthly pace of depreciation of near 50 cents per month for the rest of the fiscal year, though perhaps moderating somewhat in early 2021 should inflation fall faster than expected. On this basis, we see the rate at just under 38 BirrUSD by December 2020 and just under 41 BirrUSD by June 2021.
