BOARD CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE Ambassador Dr. Dibaba Abdeta Chairman O n behalf of the Board of Directors and on my own behalf, it is my great pleasure to well come you all to the 25th Awash Banks Shareholders Annual General Assembly Meeting of the FY 201920. I would also like to acknowledge our honored Shareholders, Customers, Management members and all other employees of the Bank for their continued trust, unshakable patronage and commitment extended to the Bank all the years, which enabled our Bank to register again another astonishing result in all spheres of its operational activities. It is our strong belief that your all-rounded support will continue to make your Bank to remain the leading private Bank in the coming years. Despite the inconveniencies created by COVID-19 Pandemic, it is a privilege to host this meeting in such environment to share the successes of your Bank in various spheres of operational areas, including deposits, loans and advances, income, branch networks and above all, gross profit during the financial year 201920. The FY 201920 is the year of challenges to the country in general, and to the banking industry in particular. One of the challenges was the unprecedented Coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic posed on the whole world in general and on the Ethiopian economy in particular. The other challenges were the relatively elevated inflation, political instability in some parts of the country and stiff competition in the banking industry. Despite all these challenges however, our Bank operated efficiently and once again has recorded a meritorious performance and a unique result of its kind during the FY 201920. It is also worth mentioning that the Banks annual achievement was by far greater than the cascaded yearly planned target to be implemented, on the fourth year of the ten years Strategic Journey of Transforming AB Vision 2025 Project. Awash Bank showed a continued progress in building a stronger and safer Bank that is capable of delivering higher returns to its Shareholders. Over recent years, the Bank has increased income, capital and dividend paid out with a track record of creating a significant value for the shareholders. When compared with the accomplishments of the preceding year for major activities, this years operational performance surpassed in all sectors. Accordingly, deposits increased by 19 percent, loans and advances by 21 percent, income by 27 percent and gross profit by 8 percent during the year under review. Earnings on foreign currency during the year has reached USD 865 million, which is slightly below last year same period by 6 USD 53.8 million owing to the decline of foreign currency earnings from remittance and exports due to the prevalence of the Coronavirus COVID-19. Furthermore, total asset has reached Birr 89.3 billion, indicating a growth of 20 as compared to that of last year same period. The increments registered in income and gross profit in particular are because of the strong efforts made bank-wide to maximize the wallet-share of the Bank. The other major contributory factors are Annual Report 201920 4 the efforts exerted to reduce expense, the focused efforts made in the resource mobilization and also the continuous hard work put forth in the collection of loans as a result of which significant reduction was observed on the status of Non-Performing Loans NPLs. The significant performances registered were the sum results of the wise guidance of the Board of Directors, the prudent and coordinated leadership of the Senior and Middle-Level Management as well as the unreserved commitment of the entire staff of the Bank who deserve commendations of the Board. In an effort to strengthen its asset base, the Bank has initiated own building construction projects at different strategic areas. This is believed to ensure long-term and sustainable growth of the assets of the Bank. The major landmark in relation to this initiative includes, the 2B13 storey Bulbula Mixed-use Building whose construction work is under way. The Bank also acquired plots of land for new building projects both in Bale Robe and Asella towns whose construction processes are in good progress. In addition, with the desire to construct a new Head-Office Building commensurate with the image and size of Awash Bank, a construction site, with an area of 8,800 m2 has been solicited from the A.A City Administration whose title deed transfer and related payments are under process and hoped to be completed shortly. With regard to the Human Resource Management Services of the Bank, the Human Resource Management Policies and Procedures of the Bank were revised to enable attracting, motivating and retaining qualified and skilled manpower. In line with this, steps were taken to improve manpower efficiency, focusing on optimizing the existing resource through promotions postings, transfers and skill developmentcapacity building initiatives. The nature of the business also requires continuous skill upgrading through in-house or outsourced trainings. Accordingly, out of the 10,130 employees of the Bank, short- term training was given to 7,724 employees and 640 employees were also sponsored by the Bank to pursue higher education at different levels during the year under review. A total of Birr 46.6 million was spent on human resource development during the FY 201920. I would like to stress at this point that the Board and the Management are confident to work hard during the financial year 202021, in spite of the continuing fierce competition amongst the banks and the fear of the spread of COVID-19. The Board is also fully assertive that Awash Bank shall remain the leading private commercial bank in the country. Given the dedication of the Board, the commitment of the Management Team and the competency of the entire employees, the attainment of its grand vision of becoming World Class Bank is inevitable. The Bank continues to deliver on its strategic commitments, which drive the operational performances and create value for the owners of the Bank, the Shareholders as well as the communities at large. Both the Board and the Management are as determined and committed as before to combine their skills and energies and embark on registering yet another new shining success to maintain ABs leading position amongst the private commercial banks in the country. In addition to its corporate objectives, the contribution of the Bank to the growth of the national economy and the wellbeing of its citizens is conspicuous as observed from the tax paid and the corporate social responsibilities fulfilled. In line with this, during the FY 201920, our Bank has made financial supports for the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam GERD, for the prevention of COVID-19 pandemic, for the Addis Ababa City and Regional Parks Development and for the Addis Ababa City Schools Students Feeding Program. The Bank has paid income and other taxes to the tune of Birr 1.3 billion during the FY 201920 and was offered a Platinum Award, as one of the top tax payers of the country. In conclusion, on behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to once again extend my sincere gratitude to the Banks Shareholders, Customers, Business Partners and other Stakeholders for their continuous and indispensable support and trust. My special appreciation goes to the Management Team and the entire employees, for their dedicated services, belongingness and hard work to upsurge their Bank, in delivering commendable results and enabling the Bank to maintain its leading position among the private commercial banks in the country. I would like to thank the National Bank of Ethiopia NBE for providing us diligent guidance and strong support. I would also like to express my appreciation to Correspondent Banks, Diaspora Communities and NGOs for their willingness to cooperate and work with our Bank and we look forward to their continuous commitment to work with us in the future also. Finally, recalling that the Bank has come a long way so far and has still a long way to go, I want to assure you that in the years to come, our Bank will strongly scrutinize the laid down Vision and Strategy to bring about further excellence by exploiting opportunities and withstanding the challenging environment.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S STATEMENT Tsehay Shiferaw Chief Executive Officer O n behalf of the Management of Awash Bank and on my own behalf, I would like to congratulate all Shareholders of the Bank, respected Board of Directors, esteemed customers, committed Management members, all hard working staff and other stakeholders of the Bank on the extra- ordinary achievement our Bank has recorded in almost all financial and non-financial parameters for the financial year ended June 30, 2020. Let me seize this opportunity to congratulate you all and the Shareholders, Board of Directors, customers, Management and staff members of our sister company, Awash Insurance Company S.C., on the successful and memorable commemoration of the Silver Jubilee of the formation of the twin companies. The Silver Jubilee Celebration, which was commemorated for one month from October 25 up until November 23, 2019 under the theme, Celebrating Success, Envisioning the Future and a series of eye-catching events that took place corresponding to the anniversary celebration were very colorful, inclusive, creative and up to the standard of the two companies. The celebration has, in fact, played its part for the sister companies to maintain their outstanding positions in the industries they are operating. The 25th Anniversary Book, which is prepared by a local consulting firm in the above regards, has the details about the history, growth and development of the sister companies apart from covering the banking and insurance industries of the country in perspective. The Anniversary Book covers a wide-range of subjects and due attention has been given to it during its preparation. No doubt, it will serve as a reference material not only for the Awash community but also for the stakeholders and the general public who are interested to know about the progress and current developmens of banking and insurance business in the country. I hope, all those interested will enjoy reading the Book and benefit a lot out of it. The financial year just ended was indeed a very challenging year by all standards. The novel coronavirus COVID-19, which was declared by the World Health Organization WHO as a global pandemic, has totally disrupted the economic, political, social and cultural fabrics of societies across the globe. The world economy experienced a historic and unprecedented economic shock. The impact of this global pandemic was unparalleled and it resulted in closure of businesses domestically as well as globally. The health crisis led to economic crisis, which in many places led to social crisis as a result of what is referred in Economics as a Domino Effect. Domestically, business was not as usual. The impact of the coronavirus was far-reaching and such economic sectors like tourism and hospitality, transport, construction, entertainment industry and manufacturing were very much vulnerable and hard hit Annual Report 201920 10 by the pandemic. In an effort to ameliorate the possible destructive situations of the virus on the well-being of human life in general and on business in particular, our Bank made some amendments on fees, commissions and charges as well as on lending interest rate of selected seriously hit sectors so that our customers will be able to withstand the problem and keep on sustaining their business. Donations of over Birr 11 million was given to the Federal Government and other charity organizations to deal with the problem. Millions of Birr was also expended to purchase face mask, glove, sanitizer and other items for our staff and esteemed customers to prevent the spread of the pandemic. All-in-all, as a result of the unexpected coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, our Bank has foregone hundreds of millions of Birr that could otherwise have been an income to the Bank. Though the performance of the export sector was commendable in the first half of the financial year, the export income, especially from the export of flower, has significantly declined in the second half mainly because of the lockdown in the European countries, movement restriction and declaration of state of emergency by most countries. In aggregate, the pandemic resulted in decline and slowdown of the economy in general. Apart from the above, instability in some parts of the country and subsequent closure of branch offices for a couple of days, stiff competition among local banks for resource mobilization and the 30 foreign currency surrender requirement, which is still in place, are the challenges encountered during the financial year. In spite of the above serious challenges, however, with a concerted effort of all, our Bank was able to perform commendably well in almost all financial and non- financial parameters. Awash Banks gross profit before tax stood at Birr 3.6 billion from Birr 3.34 billion of last year same period i.e. Birr 256 million or 8 growth. This performance is by far the highest in the history of our Bank as well as in the private banking industry. Following the shareholders decision at its 16th Extra- ordinary Meeting held on November 30, 2019 to raise the paid-up capital of the Bank from Birr 6 billion to Birr 12 billion in three years time, the paid-up capital has now reached Birr 5.85 billion from Birr 4.38 billion of last year same period that is, an increment of Birr 1.46 billion or 33.4. Spurred by the capital increment, earning per share EPS has slightly declined from 632 in 2019 to 510 in 2020 for a par value of Birr 1,000. Nevertheless, I believe, it is very lucrative and encouraging to the shareholders. The cost of operation for the year just ended was tremendous. This was generally because of enhanced operation, inflationary situation for goods and services country-wide, opening of 56 new branches against the plan of 40 and unexpected costs in connection with the prevention of the spread of coronavirus COVID-19. Accordingly, the total expense of the Bank has escalated from Birr 4.71 billion in 2019 to Birr 6.6 billion in 2020. Of the total expense items, interest expense, personnel expense, and other operating expenses took the highest share in their order. Total deposit as at June 30, 2020 stood at Birr 74.3 billion and that was the highest deposit balance ever registered in our Bank as well as in the history of private banks. The deposit balance grew by Birr 11.8 billion or 19 in 2020 as compared to 2019. Total asset significantly grew from Birr 74.64 billion in 2019 to Birr 89.3billion in 2020 i.e., a growth of Birr 1.47 billion or 19.7 and that is commendable by all standards. Loans and advances took the lions share of the total asset accounting for Birr 57.3 billion or 64 of the total asset of the Bank. NBE bills accounted for Birr 9.9 billion or 11 of the total asset, but thanks to the Governments decision to cease the 27 bills purchase requirement, the bills so far purchased are being redeemed at maturity and this will strengthen the liquidity position of the Bank for provision of loans and advances to those sectors that are in need of it. The NPLs ratio as at June 30, 2020 stood at 1.7 and this was much lower than the threshold i.e. 5, set by the NBE. The NPLs ratio in comparison with the total loan portfolio is not as such big enough but still effort will be exerted with greater vigor to maintain the ratio at the lowest possible limit. In general, the financial year 201920 was thriving in many respects as can be substantiated with the following, among others, major success stories 1. For the fourth time, our Bank has successfully achieved all the targets set in the Grand Strategy. Hence, our journey to Becoming One of the Top Ten East African Commercial Banks by the year 2025 is very likely achievable, 2. The Performance Management System, which is used in the planning, reward, staff capacity development and staff motivation system, has been internally developed and it will be put in place effective from FY 202021, 3. The Banks new six story Jimma Building was fully completed and colorfully inaugurated on 11 Annual Report 201920 Prosper with the Leading Private Bank! November 16, 2019. The constructions of Bulbula Building here in Addis Ababa and Bale Robe Building have been started and are progressing well. Plots of land for our future Head-quarters Building and Assela Building have also been secured, 4. With the establishment of Coronavirus COVID-19 Prevention Ad-hoc Committee bank-wide, all necessary awareness creation was made about the virus to all staff members of the Bank. The Committee is serving as a liaison between the Bank and external organs in the dissemination of information about the virus, provision of necessary support to vulnerable of the problem and the like. At this point, the work of the Ad-hoc Committee to withstand the problem and at the same time to ensure continuity of business is appreciable, 5. The effort to capacitate all staff members by providing the necessary training in-house, locally as well as abroad went extremely well and our Bank has fully utilized the budget earmarked in this regard. The year ahead is expected to be challenging in the sense that competition among banks for deposit will be stiff, the 30 foreign currency surrender requirement, which is still in place, will erode the hard-won hard currencies of banks and the impact of the coronavirus COVID-19 on business will sustain for some time to come. More specifically, banks will be challenged with the following objective realities i. As we all recall, Ethiopias parliament passed a bill to open up the countrys financial sector to its citizens who have taken other nationalities, including allowing them to buy shares in local banks. This move is aimed at boosting the countrys foreign exchange reserve and at the same time to enable the Ethiopian-born diaspora take part in the economic growth of the country. A number of conventional and Islamic banks, some of them with even big capital subscription, are either under formation or about to commence operation and all these are expected to make the banking business tough. ii. The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is expected to slow down economic growth and exacerbates poverty. This will make the existing trend of doing business as usual challenging, iii. Business is all about peace and stability. Obstacles, failure, risk and uncertainty are everywhere. However, as John C. Maxwell, a leadership guru, underscored in his book entitled, Leadership Secrets Success does not mean avoiding failure. All of us fail. As we travel, we all hit potholes, take wrong turns or forget to check the radiator. The only person who avoids failure altogether is the person who never leaves hisher driveway. So, the real issue is not whether you are going to fail. Its whether you are going to fail successfully profiting from failure. Im still very optimistic that things will get better in the times to come and Awash will florish nurturing its customers like the river. At this point, I would like to once again extend my special gratitude to our valued customers for their loyalty and dedicated Management and strong staff members for the commendable performance registered. At the end, I would also like to thank all Shareholders, Board of Directors, Federal and Regional Government Offices and especially the National Bank of Ethiopia and Financial Intelligence Center for their support, advice and guidance in our effort to achieve our business objectives. May the Almighty God bless us all and our country!

PICTORIAL PRESENTATION OF SEMI-ANNUAL MANAGEMENT MEETING, 201920 Partial View of ManagementMeeting, 201920 Annual Report 201920 14 Board of Directors Report The Board of Directors of Awash Bank feels honored to present the Annual Report and the Audited Financial Statements of the Bank to the 25th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of Awash Bank. The report has been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, covering the period from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020. Awash Bank continued to exhibit strong operational and financial performances in FY 201920, notwithstanding the global and domestic headwinds. During FY 201920, the global economy has encountered trade policy uncertainties, geopolitical tensions and outbreak of Novel Corona Virus Disease COVID-19 pandemic. Various mitigation measuressuch as lockdowns, travel bans, closure of schools and businesses imposed by most countries to limit the spread of COVID-19 have disrupted consumption and investment activities, global trade flows, global production and supply chains, commodity prices and tourism flows. According to World Banks forecast of June 2020, the global economy is estimated to be in recession in 2020. The global economy is projected to contract sharply by 5.2 percent in 2020, much worse than during the 200809 financial crisis. Commodity prices have been hit hard by the COVID-19 outbreak, though the impact varied significantly across commodities, depending on the specific end-use sectors and regions affected by the outbreak and on the storability and supply elasticity of the commodity. For instance, the prices of oil, industrial metals, textiles and fresh cut flowers have collapsed, while prices of coffee Arabica, wheat and rice have shown some improvements. With regard to domestic economic developments, Ethiopian economy grew by 6.1 percent in 201920, lower than the original forecast of 9 percent, largely reflecting the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inflation also hovered above 15 percent, far above the Governments single digit target. The year also witnessed fastest depreciation of the exchange rate and widening of the premium between the official and the parallel market rate and major liquidity shortages in the banking system. In spite of the global and domestic challenges, Awash Bank has registered impressive results in key operational and financial areas, indicating the Banks ability to manage challenges and take advantage of the opportunities as they come along. FY 201920 was also a special year for Awash Bank, as it marks the Silver Jubilee Anniversary of the Bank. Over the past 25 years, Awash Bank has played its key role in driving the economic growth of the country and providing commendable banking services to its customers. 1. OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCES Awash Bank continued to exhibit strong operational performances in FY 201920 and that has not only positioned it as the leading private bank in Ethiopia, but also paved the way for attaining its strategic aspirations of becoming One of the Top Ten Private Banks in East Africa by 2025. The performance of the Bank reveals that Awash Bank is undoubtedly the largest private bank in Ethiopia for the last five years in a row in terms of total deposits, total loans and advances, total assets and profits. 1.1 Mobilization of Deposits In an effort to enhance the deposit mobilization endeavor of the Bank and drive the financial inclusion strategy of the country, Awash Bank has successfully attracted new customers to the Bank through expansion of both conventional and Interest Free Banking Services. Impelled by expansion of customer base and offerings of customer centric products using different service delivery channels, the aggregate deposit of the Bank, including interest free banking and margin held on letters of credit, rose to Birr 74.3 billion by the end of FY 201920, up by Birr 11.8 billion 19 percent compared with the same period of last year. Awash Bank has made superb progress in delivery of efficient and reliable Shariah Compliant Interest Free Banking Services. Consequently, interest free banking deposits reached Birr 3.95 billion as at June 30,2020, registering a growth of Birr 1.75 billion 79.5 percent from last years similar period balance of Birr 2.2 billion. 15 Annual Report 201920 Prosper with the Leading Private Bank! The funding mix of the Bank reveals that saving deposits accounted for the major portion of total deposits 60 percent, followed by demand deposits Figure 1 Deposit Structure as at June 30, 2020 Table 1 Aggregate Deposits by Type In Millions of Birr 27 percent, time deposits 8 percent and LC margin 5 percent. Annual Report 201920 16 1.2 Loans and Advances In line with the Banks brand promise of Nurturing Like the River, Awash Bank provides loans and advances that help to improve the lives of individuals, boost business activities and enhance the overall economic development of Ethiopia as a whole. The case in point is the agreement signed between Awash Bank and The United States Agency for International Development USAID on December 13, 2019 for partial guarantee of qualifying loans. The objective of the agreement is to enhance the lending capacity of Awash Bank to Agricultural Small and Medium Enterprises and local Microfinance Institutions MFIs. MFIs, in turn, are also expected to provide on-lending facilities to individuals, micro and small businesses, including Productive Safety Net Program clients. The total outstanding loans and advances extended to different sectors of the economy, including interest free financing, remarkably rose to Birr 57.3 billion by the end of June 2020, up by Birr 10.0 billion 21 from Birr 47.3 billion a year ago. All sectors of the economy were the beneficiaries of the services. Accordingly, loans and advances availed to domestic trade and services accounted for the lions share 24 percent, followed by building and construction 22 percent, export 19 percent, manufacturing 12 percent, import 10 percent, personal loans 7 percent, transport 4 percent and others 3 percent. Financing to Shariah compliant projects through Interest Free Banking scheme stood at Birr one billion as at June 30,2020, up by Birr 765.9 million 294 percent compared with the same period of last year.

Some of the Investments Businesses Financed by Awash Bank DINA Food Processing Annual Report 201920 18 1.3 International Banking Services The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic and the downward trend of global economy has adversely affected the inflow of foreign currency to Ethiopia, particularly from services hotels, tour operators etc., and inward remittances. Nevertheless, Awash Bank continued to maintain strong relationships with exporters, international money transfer agents, correspondent banks and international card payment operators to enhance the inflow of foreign currency to the country. To enhance the scarce foreign exchange earning capacity of the country through exports, Awash Bank has availed loans and advances to exporters, whose outstanding loans stood at Birr 10.7 billion as at June 30, 2020. Similarly, to boost foreign exchange earnings from inward remittances, the Bank continued to roll- over the lottery based incentive mechanism. Accordingly, the Bank has awarded the prizes for the 7th and 8th round lottery winners in 201920. 19 Annual Report 201920 Prosper with the Leading Private Bank! Partial View of 7th 8th Rounds Lottery Award Ceremony Annual Report 201920 20 Figure 2 Trends in Total Assets In Billions of Birr 1.4 Total Assets Total assets of the Bank grew by Birr 14.7 billion 19.7 percent and reached Birr 89.3 billion by the end of June 30, 2020 compared with the same period of last year, largely reflecting the substantial growth of loans and advances supported by the repayment of NBE bills. Early repayment of NBE bills by the National Bank of Ethiopia to respective banks has been used by the Government as a monetary policy stimulus to alleviate the liquidity problem of banks amidst the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia. The balance sheet structure of the Bank reveals that net loans and advances account for 63 percent of total assets. On the other hand, deposits from customers constitute the lions share 91 percent of total liabilities, depicting the fact that deposits are the major source of funding in the intermediation role of Awash Bank. 1.5 Capital Following the decision of Shareholders of Awash Bank to raise the paid-up capital of the Bank to Birr 6 billion by the end of June 2020 and thereafter double it to Birr 12 billion in three years time, the paid-up capital of the Bank has increased by Birr 1.5 billion and stood at Birr 5.8 billion as at June 30, 2020 from Birr 4.4 billion a year ago. The total equity of the Bank also grew to Birr 11.97 billion at the end of June 30, 2020 from Birr 9.6 billion last year same period. Awash Bank always maintains a health buffers on its capital over the regulatory minimum capital requirements. In this regard, the Birr 5.8 billion paid- up capital of the Bank was by far above the minimum regulatory requirement of Birr 500 million and the overall capital adequacy ratio of the Bank is well above the 8 percent statutory requirement. 2. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The overall financial performance of Awash Bank during financial year 201920 was gratifying despite the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the slowdown in Ethiopian economic growth, persistent high inflation and stiff competition among banks operating in Ethiopia. 2.1 Income Total income of the Bank amounted to Birr 10.2 billion from Birr 8 billion in 201819, depicting a growth of Birr 2.2 billion 27 percent, driven by strong improvements in interest income and fees and commission income. Interest income rose by 32 percent and stood at Birr 7.9 billion, reflecting a surge in loans and advances. Similarly, income from fees and commission grew by 19 percent and reached Birr 1.6 billion, largely associated with fees derived from trade services operations and expansion of digital financial services.

Expenses The total expenses of the Bank amounted to Birr 6.6 billion by the end of June 2020, up by Birr 1.9 billion 40 percent from last year , mainly due to a surge in interest bearing deposits, personnel expenses and impairment charge on loans and other assets. Interest expense increased by 26 percent and reached Birr 2.7 billion during the review period.

It has been our regular duties and responsibilities to conduct periodic review of products and services to make sure that IFB operational activities and transactions within the Bank and its IFB policies and procedures issued henceforth are in compliance with Shariah principles and requirements. To this end, we are required to issue and submit this report, which complies with the international best practices, to be published on the Banks annual financial report. Accordingly, Awash Bank is offering the following IFB services in fund mobilization, fund utilization and service-based products at its more than 466 branches, among which 15 fifteen are full-fledged IFB Branches, designated as IKHLAS, which is brand name for the Banks IFB product.

We have reviewed the products listed above with their respective expected Shariah principles, the relevant contracts, transactions and IFB core banking introduced by Awash Bank during the year ended 30 June 2020. In addition, we have assessed the IFB policies and procedures adopted by the Bank, examined sample transactions, the relevant documentations, all information and explanations which we considered necessary and sufficiently provide us evidence to give reasonable assurance that Awash Bank operations have not violated the Shariah principles. In our opinion, generally, we, the Shariah Advisory Committee of Awash Bank, do hereby confirm that 1. The IFB products mentioned above, operational procedures, contracts, transactions and dealings entered into by the Bank during the year ended 30 June 2020 that we have reviewed are in compliance with the Shariah principles and the Shariah rulings related to IFB operations. 2. Mudarabah deposits and financing Profit-Loss Sharing is not yet started and, thus, there is no allocation of profit and charging of losses relating to investment accounts 3. The profits generated by the Bank, from Murabaha and other services like Kafalah, are Shariah-compliant and there are no earnings that have been realized from sources prohibited by the Shariah principles and thus, no fund is expected to be disposed to charitable causes from the Bank itself. However, Birr 983,429.39 collected from defaulted customers in the form of penalty must be given to Charity. 4. Awash Bank during the year ended 30 June 2020 is not required to pay zakat because its shareholders include non-Muslims also. Thank You Jazakumullah Kair!
