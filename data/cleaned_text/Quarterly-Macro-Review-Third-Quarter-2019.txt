SUMMARY Recent Developments and Year-Ahead Outlook The third quarter of the year was marked by continued stresses in some of the economys usual weak spots inflation, foreign exchange, but also by a very clear turnaround and improvement in multiple macro indicators budget revenues, exports, credit and privatization. Looking ahead, recent political developments and the planned 2020 elections are bringing uncertainties to the economic outlook, as business confidence could weaken in such an environment and new investments may get put on hold. However, offsetting such potentially negative factors, we would highlight that the growth outlook remains positive so far in the fiscal year recent rains were well above their long-term average and public sector projects are boosting construction activity the worst is over for inflation we expect Novembers 19 outturn will mark the turning point fiscal performance is looking good tax collections are up and debt ratios are down credit to the private sector is rising rapidly up 46 percent at private banks and the countrys external position is showing improvement in some areas exports are reviving, imports essentially flat, and end-June foreign reserves 560mn above year-ago levels. Perhaps most important, the central bank has significantly stepped-up the pace of exchange rate adjustment since early November, which should help close balance of payments gaps and improve fx constraints going forward. All things considered, and conditional on a stable socio-political environment, a broadly positive macro outlook thus remains our baseline forecast for the year ahead. Recent Developments GDP growth As annual GDP data is not yet released it is normally out in November or December of each year, we retain our 8.1 percent estimate for economic growth in the recently ended 2018-19 fiscal year. Our estimate reflects sector growth rates of 3.19.512.0 for agricultureservicesindustry and their respective weights of 33.337.629.1 in last years GDP. We note that the IMF has recently reduced its estimate for last fiscal year to 7.4 percent, versus 7.7 percent before, but do not see a strong basis for following their modest downward revision given that weaker- than-expected agriculture figures were already incorporated in our estimate. For the first quarter of the current fiscal year, July-September 2019, activity indicators show 16 percent real growth in tax collections, 22 percent growth in tourist arrivals, 10 percent growth in telecom subscriptions, and 1016 percent real growth respectively in depositlending levels. Though still a small part of overall GDP, a review of the nine active industrial parks Eastern, Bole Lemi, Hawassa, George Shoes, Velocity, Huajian, Kombolcha, Mekelle, and Adama shows 42 percent growth in their aggregate USD exports and 33 percent growth in total employment from year-ago levels.

Looking at the 2018-19 fiscal year, while indicators for public sector investment suggest positive trends government capital expenditure rose 14 percent in 2018- 19 and state enterprise bond borrowinga proxy for their capex activitieswas up 16 percent, private sector indicators of investment point to a modest slowdown imports of capital goods were down 3 percent for the fiscal year while FDI inflows were also lower at 3bn during 2018-19 vs 3.7bn the prior year a 19 percent decline. With respect to the most recent quarterly outturn, available indicators suggest a mixed picture capital goods imports were down 15 percent from year-ago levels mainly due to sharply lower capital equipment imports but FDI inflows are reported to be up 13 percent from year ago levels 0.7bn during July-September 2019 vs 0.62 in the same period a year ago. Inflation Inflation at end-September 2019 was 18.61 percent and end-October 2019 data show a similar rate of 18.65 percent. Month-on-month inflation in October 2019 was -0.2 percent, turning negative for the first time in exactly a year in line with seasonal norms where post-harvest months, i.e., October- December, typically show negative month-on-month rates. Food price inflation has already peaked it fell slightly to 23.2 percent in October, but non-food prices still show a rising trajectory, although at much lower levels of near 13 percent. As highlighted in our recent inflation note, it is worth recognizing that, excluding two just items vegetables and cereals, inflation is still running at a rate of near 10 percent even with the latest October 2019 data. Monetary policy Growth in broad money supply as of June 2019 latest available date continues to be around 20 percent on a year-on-year basis, roughly similar to the growth rate of the past three quarters and down notably from the 29 percent annual growth registered as of June 2017 and June 2018. Growth in central bank money supply base money reversed its decelerating trend seen in recent quarters and stood at 15.3 percent as of June 2019, mainly reflecting a jump in the deposits of commercial banks at the central bank. The latter may be due to lumpy year-end flows at commercial banks and may not necessarily be indicative of underlying trends data for subsequent quarters should confirm if reserve money growth has indeed turned significantly upward. Banking developments Ethiopias commercial banks have shown a solid start for the new fiscal year, with end-September figures showing deposits reaching Birr 918bn up 23 percent from year-ago levels and loans reaching Birr 475bn up 30 percent. Total financing provided by the banking system loans plus banks holdings of corporate bonds and NBE Bills has now reached an estimated Birr 930bn, equivalent to 101 percent of total banking system deposits. The sector also registered 26 percent growth in assets, 12 percent growth in capital, and 17 percent growth in branches to 5,346 nation-wide branches as of September 2019 from 4,986 branches a year ago. Looking just at the private banks, they have collectively been expanding their loan books at a rapid rate, with their lending virtually all to the private sector up 46 percent from year ago levels.

Fiscal policy Budgetary performance is also off to a very strong start with record- breaking revenue collections registered in recent months tax receipts reached Birr 57bn in the first three months of the fiscal year, exceeding the Birr 56bn budgetary target and a 29 percent jump from year-ago levels. Press reports suggest October collections were even better, at Birr 32.6bn for just that month, suggesting a positive year-total outlook. Debt Total public debt reached 53.7bn at end-June 2019, up by 1.2bn4.2bn for the quarteryear, but down when expressed relative to GDP from 58.9 percent at end-June 2018 to 56.4 percent at end-June 2019 based on our USD nominal GDP estimates of 95.3bn for 2018-19. Looking only at external debt, this stands at 28.4 percent of GDP, down from 30.8 percent of GDP in June 2018. Ethiopia has now been showing three consecutive quarters of declines in the debt to GDP ratio. MOFEC debt data per the Public Sector Debt Portfolio Report show external debt continuing to have broadly favourable terms, i.e., low average interest rates 2.8 percent and long average maturities 11 years. Trade The persistently weak export performance seen over the past few years was reversed in July-September, with total exports reaching 723mn for the quarter, or a growth rate of 15 percent from year-ago levels. This growth reflected the strong performance of exports such as coffee 232mn for the quarter, up 14 percent, roses 115mn, up 118 percent, chat 93mn, up 17 percent, textiles 52mn, up 53 percent, pulses 49mn, up 12 percent, and live animals 24mn, up 66 percent. Rose exports have done particularly well and are on track to surpass 400mn in annual exports if their current pace is sustained becoming the second largest export after coffee. Though the first quarters 15 percent growth rate is promising, it is also somewhat exaggerated by the unusually low export figure this time last year and year-total exports are thus unlikely to be significantly above 3bn, in our view. Some previously large export categoriesit should be notedcontinue to be under strain, most notably for oilseedssesame down 7 percent, leather products down 29 percent and gold down 61 percent. With respect to import trends, the July- September period showed minimal growth in imports up just 2 percent from 3.68bn a year ago to 3.75bn this past quarter, and a review of the key sub- components reveals declines in imports of capital goods down 15 and in fuel down 10, thanks to global oil prices, which were offset somewhat by significant increases in imports of manufactured inputs up 28 percent for semi- finished goods. Balance of payments BOP Data to June 2019 show improvements in several key components of the balance of payments. The trade deficit was roughly unchanged at 12.4bn, equivalent to an improvement from around 15 of GDP to 13 of GDP for the year. At the same time, fx inflows from service exports rose to near 5bn up 17 percent from the previous year while fx inflows from remittances reached 5.7bn up 11 percent. FDI inflows were about 19 percent RESEARCH ANALYTICS Disclaimer This report represents solely the views, analysis, and judgement of the Cepheus research team and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Funds Managing Partners, Advisors, or Investors. 4 lower than the previous year just 3.0 bn vs 3.7bn, though Ethiopia still ranks among the highest recipients of foreign investment in the continent, per UNCTAD data. Grants and loans taken together rose to 3.6bn in 2018-19, or a growth rate of 20 percent compared to the previous years combined grantloan inflow of 3.1bn. Reflecting the net impacts of the above, the central banks fx reserves rose by 568mn during the fiscal year, reaching 3.4bn as of June 2019 2.7 months of import cover and roughly 1.7 times annual external debt service. Exchange rate The exchange rate reached 29.43 BirrUSD at end-October 2019, a 6 percent depreciation rate from its level a year ago. The depreciation effected over the past year has not fully covered the 18 percent year-on-year inflation registered over the same period, pointing to a notable loss in competitiveness on a real effective exchange rate basis which the central bank estimated to be 21 percent in FY 2018-19 based on their REER indices. In an apparent recognition of the need to reverse this sizeable loss of competitiveness, a much faster pace of exchange rate adjustment has been adopted by the central bank as of early November, with the Birr depreciating by 50 cents just in the first 20 days of November up to the November 20, 2019 cut-off date of this note vs a normal depreciation of just 14 cents per month that had been in place throughout the past year October 2018 to October 2019. Sovereign bond and Market Ratings Ethiopias sovereign bond showed a small decline of 7 basis points, from 5.74 percent at end-June 2019 to 5.67 percent at end-September. During the quarter, two of the three international rating agencies Fitch and Moodys changed their sovereign rating on Ethiopia to a negative outlook while still retaining their overall B and B1 ratings. Standard Poors has maintained both its B rating as well as its stable outlook. On purely macroeconomic criteria, we find the two rating agencies switch to a negative outlook somewhat unexpected at this point compared to, say, a year ago, given that the countrys current external position shows a lower current account deficit, higher fx reserve stock, improved debt ratio, and stronger privatization prospects than that seen in the recent years. Macro-structural reforms Multiple structural reformswith potentially sizeable and positive macroeconomic impactshave been initiated or advanced in the third quarter. Among the most notable 1 extensive progress was made on telecom privatization, including the operationalization of the regulatory body ECA and the collection of proposals from sell-side advisers some 22 of which put in expressions of interest 2 two solar projects were awarded under the Independent Power Producer Scheme, setting the stage for many more such ventures under the Governments Public-Private Partnerships PPPs 3 the sale of six of a planned thirteen sugar plants was advanced to its final phase and 4 the Ministry of Mines Petroleum issued ten mining licenses seven for exploration, the rest for production to jump-start explorations and activity in this area.

In such an environment, public confidence and business sentiment may turn cautious or negative leading to cutbacks in investment and thus lower growth, while policymakers attention and priorities may move away from the economic reform agenda. While such risks are an inherent part of the outlook for Ethiopia in 2020, three countervailing factors mitigate some of these concerns, in our view 1 trends in macro policies and outturns are mostly positive so far into the fiscal year as summarized in the prior section 2 economic reform initiativesprivatization, PPPs, job creation, and ease of doing business reforms do not show any signs of a loss in momentum their execution actually appears to have strengthened in recent months, especially for privatization and 3 broader policy priorities in the run up to the election are likely to show morenot less emphasis on ensuring stable socio-economic conditions via, for example, enhanced security and stronger inflation control over the coming months. Taking these considerations into account, and on the assumption of a relatively stable socio- political environment, we thus continue to form our macroeconomic projections on the basis of a broadly benign outlook for the year ahead. GDP growth As emphasized in our recent macroeconomic reviews, the current composition of Ethiopias GDP makes growth figures highly dependent on the performance of crops, construction, and servicesand the outlook for all three is broadly positive. Crop volumes are heavily dependent on rains, whose levels in the just-finished kiremt months were 23 percent higher than the ten-year average and 2 percent higher than last years rainfall levels per our compilation of National Meteorological Agency data. The Ministry of Agriculture anticipates a crop output of over 35mn tons this year, versus last years 32mn tons, but we find this somewhat ambitious and use a more modest 5 percent increase as the basis for our agriculture sector growth forecasts. Better-than-normal rains and higher fertilizer usage which was up 23 percent judging by January-June imports certainly support the ambitious growth projection, but other factorsincluding locust infestations in some parts of the countrywill partly offset some of these positive prospects, in our view. For the industrial sector, whose largest sub- sector is actually construction, this should be propelled by an increased capital budget, including the re-starting andor continuation of several major road building projects a record high of Birr 47bn was approved in this years budget, up 21 percent from last year and the launch of public housing initiatives Addis Ababa alone has already started with a ground-breaking on some 20,000 units this fiscal year. Within manufacturing, recent improvements in electricity power supplies after extensive outages in March-July should boost activity, while the performance seen at industrial parksthough growing from a small basealso suggests a positive momentum given 42 percent growth in total exports now nearing 200mn on an annualized basis and 33 percent growth in employment during the first quarter of this year. On service sector activities, first quarter RESEARCH ANALYTICS Disclaimer This report represents solely the views, analysis, and judgement of the Cepheus research team and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Funds Managing Partners, Advisors, or Investors. 6 outturns in tax collections especially VAT, tourist arrivals, and banking suggest to us continued strong growth trends in this sub-sector of the economy. Considering all of the above, we think overall GDP growth will be around 8 percent for 2019-20 the IMF projects 7.2 percent in its October 2019 WEO and the World Bank 8.2 percent in its Economic Update of May 2019. As emphasized above, our growth projection presumesamong other thingsthat political developments will not adversely affect business sentiment and economic activity over the coming months. Inflation With respect to the inflation outlook, the worst is overin our view since month-on-month price changes have now turned negative for the first time in over a year and harvested crops are gradually beginning to enter national food markets. Although we expect another negative month-on-month inflation outturn for November, year-on-year inflation will likely rise to 19 percent just briefly when end-November 2019 figures are released in early December due to a base effect with the CPI index having fallen sharply in November last year. This end-November figure will, in our estimation, mark the highest inflation rate for the rest of the fiscal year. With the normalization of domestic food prices over the coming months, the continued subsidization of key staple foods sugar, wheat, cooking oil and assuming no increases in global oil prices per IMF forecasts, we project inflation will remain in the mid- to low-teens up to the first quarter of 2020 but then show a marked decline thereafter. Our projection for June 2020 is a year-on-year inflation rate of 10.3 percent. Fiscal policy and debt Given strong tax collections in the past few months, we believe the government will comfortably meet its tax revenue target of Birr 225bn for the fiscal year 40 percent of the years tax revenue target has already been collected in the first one-third of the year. With expenditure expected to largely follow budgeted amounts, the years deficit targetBirr 97bn or 3 percent of GDPis thus likely to be achieved as well a contingency fund of Birr 14bn is also set aside in the budget should any new priorities or surprises arise that require additional expenditure. Financing of the budget deficit should not pose a major challenge, given external funding of around Birr 42bn mainly from the World Bank and AfDB and domestic financing of Birr 57bn that can be secured without much difficulty from a combination of Treasury Bill issuances, non-bank sources of funding namely pension funds, and likely some use of central bank advances. Monetary and banking Our expectation for banking and monetary trends this year is largely unchanged from our last quarterly review we had forecast aggregate banking deposits to reach Birr 1.1 trillion by June 2020 equal to 33 percent of GDP and also anticipated that the ratio of total bank financing to deposits after accounting for reserve requirements and NBE Bills should remain a very high 99 percent, revealing the near-full deployment of mobilized deposits. Banking developments as of September 2019 are consistent with this full year projection and we thus keep unchanged our monetary and banking forecasts. We continue to project money supply growth at 20 percent for the year, somewhat RESEARCH ANALYTICS Disclaimer This report represents solely the views, analysis, and judgement of the Cepheus research team and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Funds Managing Partners, Advisors, or Investors. 7 below the 24 percent expansion expected in nominal GDP 8 percent growth in real GDP growth plus 16 percent growth in the GDP deflator for FY 2019-20. Balance of payments We broadly retain the balance of payments outlook for FY 2019-20 our Q2 macro review anticipated a near 1bn increase in reserves conditional on privatization related inflows being booked by June 2020. Relative to our projections from last quarter, we think exports will be slightly higher and imports slightly lower both of which will further reduce the trade deficit. At the same time, there are likely to be some shortfalls to our previous projections for tourism and FDI inflows excluding privatization given recent developments and first quarter outturns. These projections broadly offset each other, and we thus still expect a surplus of just above 1bn on the balance of payments this year. Given a starting central bank fx reserves stock of 3.4bn at end-June 2019 we had estimated 3.6bn, we thus now see end-June 2020 reserves at 4.5bn including prospective privatization receipts. As monthly imports are 1.25bn and annual external debt service near 2.0bn including principal and interest payments, the projected fx reserves stock as of June 2020 would cover 3.4 months of imports and 2.3 times annual debt service dues. Exchange rate With respect to the exchange rate outlook, this months faster pace of depreciation will continue into 2020, in our view. Simply extrapolating the trend seen so far this month suggests a depreciation of more than 1 Birr for the full month of Novemberwhich is a pace of adjustment that, if sustained, would imply a very significant depreciation for the year ahead. However, such a pace of monthly depreciation cannot be expected to continue for too long, in our view, and it should indeed begin to moderate once inflation falls towards single digit levels. Given our expectation that inflation will drop markedly by early 2020, we anticipate a slower pace of monthly exchange rate adjustments at that time. Thus, despite the uncertainties involved, we presume the current pace of rate adjustment around 1 Birr per month will be in place for only a couple months, followed thereafter by a much more moderate pace of adjustment in line with declining inflation. Reflecting these assumptions, we forecast the exchange rate will reach 32.8 BirrUSD by June 2020a roughly 13 percent depreciation from year-ago levels that if realized would be a welcome and warranted move to help address Ethiopias acute fx constraints.

We forecast 5 percent growth in major crops, partly due to higher fertilizer usage this year judging from the 22 percent growth seen in fertilizer import data Rainfall in the kiremt months was significantly above the ten-year average and higher than last year, further suggesting favourable agricultural outcomes Growth projections We expect GDP growth be 8 percent in FY 2019-20, aided by 5 percent growth in crop production Industry growth is expected at 12 percent, given the strength of construction activity. The service sub-sector will growth by close to 8 percent, in our view, judging by first quarter outturns in VAT collections, banking activity, and tourist arrivals.

Investment trends Investment indicators for last fiscal year were broadly positive, but had shown a slowdown in a few areas such as FDI. For the first quarter of this fiscal year, a positive trend is now seen in FDI, but imports of capital goods continue to show year-on-year declines.

Inflation has now been above 15 percent for six consecutive months. Several items with large CPI weights continue to show double-digit inflation Vegetables 35, Bread Cereals 30, and meat 27. Inflation of domestically produced items remains much higher than inflation for imports or for services. Five major food categoriesvegetables, breads, fruits, meat, and alcoholic beverages showed inflation of over 20 percent The top non-food items that showed double-digit inflation were transport, housing, and health services.

This has translated to an annual depreciation of around 6 percent. Recent monthly depreciation For November 2019, however, the pace of depreciation has been much faster, amounting to 50 cents during just the first 20 days of the month. At the current pace, the monthly deprecation will surpass 1 Birr for the month of November. Exchange rate projections We expect the current accelerated pace of depreciation will be in place for only a couple months. A more moderate pace of Birr depreciation is likely once inflation declines markedly in early 2020.

Sovereign Bond Prices With falling yields, prices on Ethiopia's bonds are now above their par value of 100 and reached 104.2 as of September 2019. Spread vs US Treasuries Reflecting the falling yield, spreads vs US Treasuries have also declined and now stand at just 412 basis points, roughly at their average levels since the start of the year.
