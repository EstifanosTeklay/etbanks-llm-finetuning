T his is a moment of great felicity for me in warmly welcoming you all, on behalf the Board of Directors and on my own behalf to the 27th Awash Banks Shareholders Annual General Meeting AGM of the FY 202122. I would also like to convey my sincere gratitude to our respected clientele for the esteemed cooperation, continued trust and support extended to enable Awash Bank to score yet another astonishing result in all of the banking operation parameters during the FY 202122. The devotion and the hardworking commitment of the Management and the entire employees of the Bank is also incomparable and extraordinary that deserves honorary recognition. I am also confident that this multidimensional support from all stakeholders will also continue to make the Bank remain the pioneer leading private bank in the country as well as realizing of its future ambition of achievement. Awash Bank is committed to maintaining upholding good corporate governance in order to protect the interests of shareholders, customers and the employees. The Bank is governed by twelve Board of Directors elected by the General Assembly and the Management team comprising of the Chief Executive OfficerCEO, Chief Deputy Chief Officers, Directors and Deputy Directors. With these compositions, Awash Bank showed a continued progress in building a stronger and safer Bank that is capable of delivering higher returns to its shareholders. Particularly, over the past ten years, the Bank has recorded an amazing result that shown an augmented income and earning per share, with a track record of creating a significant value for its owners. The FY 202122 was characterized by significant socio- economic and geopolitical challenges particularly to the banking industry with stagnant global trade, disrupted lively hoods, subdued investments and uncertainties. The major challenges of the year at global level were the negative impacts of the Russia- Ukraine war and the consequent high inflation. The war has also caused major supply disruptions which led to higher prices for a number of commodities. It also affected global economic prospects and according to the World Bank Report of June 2022, the global growth is projected to slow down from 5.7 percent in 2021 to 2.9 percent in 2022 and average of 3 percent 11 Nurturing Like the River Annual Report 202122 in 202324. When coming to the domestic economy, the political instability in some parts of the country, the effect of COVID 19, drought, inflation, a sharp fall in donor financing, foreign exchange shortages and stiff competitions among the banks were the major challenges. Despite of these considerable hurdles, however, the year was an exciting year enabling the Bank to operate efficiently and once again record a commendable result which is unique of its kind. The major and key financial and non-financial highlights for the year ended June 30, 2022 can be summed up as under The aggregate deposit increased by 41percent from last year same period and reached Birr 152 billion including LC margin and deposit from IFB, Loans and Advances surged up by 47.6 percent as compared to last year same period and reached Birr 129.2 billion, Total income of the Bank escalated by 50.2 percent from last year same period and arrived at Birr 20.6 billion, The total expense of the Bank stood at Birr 13.2 billion as at June 30, 2022, up by 47.9 percent from previous year similar period, The profit grew by 54.5 percent over previous year and reached Birr 7.45 billion, as at ended June 2022, Total Foreign Currency generated during the year crossed one Billion and stood at USD 1.25 billion surpassing the amount generated last year same period by USD 343.5 million or 38 percent, The aggregate deposit customer base rose to 7.8 million, The branch network as at June 30, 2022 has reached 725. The increments registered in the major performances is exceptional in the history of the private banks and the history of Awash Bank itself, reflecting the underlying strengths of the ABs business. The other major contributory factors for the growth are the efforts exerted in the resource mobilization activities and the continuous hard work applied in the collection of loans and advances, as a result of which the status of the Non-Performing Loans NPLs has shown a significant reduction to less than 1.5 percent as at the end of June 30, 2022. In general, the overall success of the Bank is coiled on the wise guidance of the Board of Directors, the prudent and coordinated quality leadership of the CEO, the Management Members as well as the unreserved dedication of the entire employees and the overall strong efforts made by the Bank-wide community to maximize the wallet share of the Bank. Though the year was turbulent and daunting, it is worth mentioning to raise one miraculous victory which the Bank enjoyed during the year under review. This amazing event was that a well-known world-wide Finance Magazine named Global Finance Magazine has chosen Awash Bank, as one of the Worlds Best Bank in the year 2022. In connection with this particular selection, the Bank was recognized during the IMFWorld Bank Annual Meeting which was held in Washington DC on October 15,2022. This has changed the history of Awash Bank and repositioned it to another higher growth level of the world standard. At this point, it should be noted the Board is always committed to ensuring that Awash Bank is a resilient organization with a focus on long-term value creation. The fast-track actions taken by the Board during the year, for fundamental changes ensuring sustainable profitable growth through excellence in operation, technology ultimately customer experience have all contributed to the success of the Bank. Awash Bank is engaged in many different project activities, such as Corporate Strategy Development by a well-known international consultant, McKinsey Co., IT Projects and the construction of own building projects at different parts of the country. To make the future IT Platform more user-friendly for the clients and also to go abreast along with the unprecedented surge in the digitalization of financial services, the Bank has planned to review the current technology system and replace some of them with modern and standardized technology. Concerning the Human Capital Management, the Board believes that having an engaged motivated workforce a sound governance risk management are pivotal to attain the sustainable growth and the vision that the Bank aspires for. In this regard, the Bank is crafting a strategy that enables attract, motivate and retain qualified and skilled manpower. Concurrent with this, steps were taken to improve staff productivity, focusing on optimizing the existing resource through internal job postings, transfers and skill developmentcapacity building initiatives. In connection with the capital structure, the payment of the Birr 12 billion paid up capital of the Bank would be completed before June 2023. The strategic growth aspiration of the Bank, which is to become one of the top ten African Banks by the year 2030 have to be backed by a solid capital base. On top of that, the capital adequacy ratio of the Bank also should comfortably be above the regulatory requirement and should provide strong foundation for the company. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the growth of the Bank itself entails capital growth. 12 Nurturing Like the River Annual Report 202122 Therefore, in consideration of the above points, the Board solicits the Shareholders to approve a new paid up capital proposed by the Board as included in the extra-ordinary agenda items to maintain the Bank with a strong capital position for the coming years. Moreover, the Board and the Management are still courageous to work hard during the FY 202223, in spite of the entry of foreign banks and consequent fierce competition amongst Banks, the persistence of the impacts of living costs and political instability globally and domestically. Given the dedication of the Board, the commitment of the Management Team, the competency of the entire employees and the results registered to date, the attainment of the new vision of becoming One of the Top Ten African Banks by 2030 is inevitable. The Bank will continue to deliver on its strategic commitments, which drive the operational performances and create value for the shareholders as well as the communities at large. On top of its corporate objectives, the contribution of the Bank to the growth of the national economy of the country and the wellbeing of its citizens during the year under review is eye-catching as observed from the annual tax paid, the financial contributions made for the national development projects as well as the various financial supports given to the disaster victims. During the year under review, Awash Bank has provided financial support to the displaced and drought stricken people of Oromia and Somali Regional States. It also supported the flood victims in the Amhara Regional State, during the reporting period. In conclusion, on behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to express my honest appreciations to all shareholders, loyal customers and the public at large for their unwavering and indispensable support and the confidence they have on our Bank. I look forward to their continuous and renewed commitment to work with the Bank in the future to come. My special thanks goes to the Management Members and the entire employees for their passion and commitment, belongingness and hard work to upswing their Bank, in delivering commendable results and enabling the Bank to maintain its leading position among the private commercial banks in the country. I would also like to commend the National Bank of Ethiopia NBE for providing our Bank a constructive guidance and enthusiastic support. Finally, recalling that the Bank has come a long way so far, and has still a long way to go, I want to assure you that in the years to come, our Bank will strongly scrutinize the laid down new vision and strategy to bring about further excellence by exploiting opportunities and vigilantly withstanding the challenging environment.

All other stakeholders of the Bank would also deserve due recognition and appreciation for their relentless support rendered to us to enable us achieve this extra-ordinary performance in the history of our Bank as well as in the industry of private banks of the country. The financial year just ended was challenging. COVID-19, which was declared as a global pandemic, has still been a concerning health problem world-wide. As a result, movement to and from countries has not been as wide-open as it used to be. The war between Russia and Ukraine has seriously affected the economic and political situations of the world and its impact is still being felt by many countries. Domestically, the war in the northern part of our country is utterly affecting the national economy in general and the banking business in particular. The instability in the western part and subsequent intermittent closure of branch offices has negatively affected our day-to-day operations and undesirably restricted our endeavor in reaching the unbanked and under-banked parts of the society. Apart from the above, the following were some of the most visible hurdles that we were exposed to during the financial year 1. During the year, month-to-month inflation rate peaks at above 30, showing an increase from CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS STATEMENT Tsehay Shiferaw Chief Executive Officer 22 Nurturing Like the River Annual Report 202122 similar periods of last year. Both food and non- food parts of the index showed an upward momentum and sometimes, it has reached to the level of 42.9 compared to the same period of last year. As it goes without saying, this inflationary situation nation-wide has similarly escalated the various expenses of the Bank. 2. In January 2022, the central bank slashed foreign currency retention rates by half to 20. Thus, foreign account holders can only retain 20 of their transfers in foreign currencies, and they shall surrender only 10 to the commercial banks. More significantly, the surrender requirement has been changed from 50 to 70. Thus, the majority 70 forex earnings from exports, remittances, and transfers to non-governmental organizations NGOs were being surrendered to the central bank. This has significantly eroded the foreign currency position of the Bank and we faced challenges to address the high demand of our importers satisfactorily. 3. In line with the letter of the Ministry of Finance, public institutions were instructed to close their accounts at private banks and transfer their resources to the coffer at public bank, which has been assigned by the central bank to manage public money on its behalf. Apparently, this will affect the deposit balance of private banks in the short and long term and will make doing business with public institutions in the future uncertain. The impact of the above and other factors on our business was substantial. However, our Bank has been and is still putting in place different strategies to withstand the circumstances and be able to sustain our businesses. The above being the facts on the ground, however, the following prospects were also available during the year and our Bank was able to make use of the opportunities to the fullest extent possible. 1. Nation-wide, the export of goods over the 202122 financial year brought in USD 4.12 Billion, nearly 14 higher than the revenue generated last year. Agricultural commodities accounted for close to three-quarters of the revenue. Coffee remained the most valuable export item, generating USD 1.4 Billion by exporting close to 300,000 tons. As a result, the foreign currency generated by our Bank through different sources, which was USD 1.25 Billion, was by far higher than last year same period of USD 902 Million. 2. Memorandum of Understanding MoU has been signed with various organizations during the year. These organizations have been channeling a good sum of local and hard currencies through our Bank and that has enabled us to address the demands of our customers as much as possible. 3. As a result of the strength of our Bank in terms of its total asset, capital, branch network and other financial parameters, local prominent giant organizations have chosen Awash Bank as their business partner. As a result, substantial amount of local deposits has been mobilized during the year. Our business relationships with these strategic partners will be reinforced with greater vigor and enthusiasm in the times to come. 4. Customers Week of the Bank was colorfully celebrated and successfully concluded in March 2022. The celebration of the program has enabled us to renew our commitment to serving our customers diligently and taking a lesson from the program, it has been resolved to conduct such type of program bank-wide every year. 5. For the first time in the industry, our Bank has introduced an innovative payment solution known as Awash E-School Management System to various local schools, colleges and universities free of charge. The solution will basically provide parents and students a wide-range of payment options, ensuring the payment of the fees timely, efficiently and conveniently. This will definitely avoid the burden of manual collection and the risks associated with it and help the Bank in its resource mobilization endeavor. 6. In an effort to expand business relationship and thereby enhance the foreign exchange stock of the Bank, our Bank has officially started relationship with Swiss Remit, Thunes and Remitly remittance companies during the year. 23 Nurturing Like the River Annual Report 202122 7. As a result of an impressive growth of our Bank in deposits, loans and advances, assets, profit, capital, branch network, customer base expansion, product innovation and digital banking expansion efforts over the last ten years, the Global Finance Magazine has named our Bank as the Best Bank of Ethiopia for the Year 2022 in its May 2022 Edition of the Best Bank Awards. This will definitely enhance the reputation of our Bank world-wide. 8. Our Bank has become a member of Small and Medium Enterprises SME Financing Forum. The Forum has 240 member banks and fintech companies. The Forum will enable to promote members best practices, transfer knowledge among members and to foster cooperation. No doubt, being a member of the Forum will enhance the reputation of our Bank in the times to come. 9. In May 2022, an Entrepreneurship Competition coined under the name Tatariwochu was launched with a primary objective of empowering the visionaries. The project will provide training, business development support and access to finance for entrepreneurs with innovative and problem-solving business ideas and it is expected to play its role in nation- building activities and last, but not least, 10.Our Bank has signed loan agreement with Nine Private Micro-Finance Institutions MFIs to bridge reaching out to the under- served segment of the market through these institutions. The Bank has made Br. 5.5 Billion available in credit for small enterprises and farmers to be disbursed through these MFIs in the coming three years. This will somehow address the access to finance of the under- financed groups of the society and at the same time bring in the money in circulation to the banking system. Exploiting the available opportunities and learning from drawbacks, our Bank, with a coordinated effort of all, has performed remarkably well in all parameters during the year. Accordingly, profit before tax stood at Birr 7.45 Billion from Birr 4.82 Billion of last year same period i.e. Birr 2.6 Billion or 54.5 percent growth. This is the highest profit ever registered in the history of our Bank as well as in the history of private banks. The paid-up capital has reached Birr 10.29 Billion from Birr 8.19 Billion of last year same period that is, an increment of Birr 2.1 Billion or 25.65. In spite of the capital increment, the pace of the growth of profit was even higher and as a result, earnings per share EPS has shown a significant growth from 470 in 2021 to 570 in 2022 for a par value of Birr 1,000 which, I believe, is very lucrative to the shareholders. As a result of, among others, enhanced operation of the Bank and inflationary situation for goods and services, total expense of the Bank, including interest expense, has gone up from Birr 8.40 Billion in 2021 to Birr 12.33 Billion in 2022. Of the total expense items, personnel expenses, interest expense, and other operating expenses took the highest share in their order. Total deposit as at June 30, 2022 stood at Birr 151.64 Billion and that was the highest deposit balance ever registered in our Bank as well as in the history of private banks. The deposit balance grew by Birr 43.87 Billion or 41 in 2022 as compared to 2021. Total asset significantly grew from Birr 128.70 Billion in 2021 to Birr 183.4 Billion in 2022 i.e., a growth of Birr 54.70 Billion or 42.51, and that was the highest figure by all standards. Loans and advances took the biggest share of the total asset accounting for Birr 126.9 Billion or 69.20 of the total asset of the Bank. The NPLs ratio as at June 30, 2022 stood at 1.2 and this was far below the threshold i.e. 5, set by the NBE. The NPLs ratio in comparison with the total loan portfolio was not as such a concerning issue but still all possible effort will be exerted to keep it at the lowest possible limit. Our Bank has opened 159 branches in the fiscal year and the total number of branches as at end of June 2022 reached 725. Despite the ups and downs, the financial year 2021 was thriving in many aspects to the banking industry in general and to our Bank in particular. Some of the major success stories were the following 1. For the sixth time, our Bank has successfully achieved all the targets set in the Grand 24 Nurturing Like the River Annual Report 202122 iv. Country-level double-digit inflation rate for food and non-food items is expected to escalate the expenses of the Bank. Thus, cost minimization strategies have to be devised internally and put in place to tackle the problem, etc I am, however, very optimistic that things will settle down in due course of time and Awash will keep on doing even better to satisfy the interests of its stakeholders. I believe that with our renewed commitment and concerted effort, we can succeed in our business objectives as success is nothing but its all about Seeing our ultimate goals, Understanding the obstacles, Creating a positive mental picture, Clearing our mind of self-doubt, Embracing the challenges, Staying on track and Showing the world that we can do it! Taking this opportunity, I would like to extend my heart-felt appreciation once again to our valued customers for their loyalty, and committed Management and hardworking staff members for the remarkable performance registered in 202122. Finally, I would like to extend my gratitude to all Shareholders, Board of Directors, our Correspondent Banks, Federal and Regional Government Offices and particularly the National Bank of Ethiopia and Financial Intelligence Center for their unreserved support, advice and guidance rendered to us in our day-to-day activities. God bless you all and our country! Strategy. Hence, our journey framed six years before to Become One of the Top Ten East African Commercial Banks by the Year 2025 is likely to be attainable and 2. Our Bank has entered into a contractual agreement with an internationally renowned strategy development company named McKinsey and Company for the development of a Corporate Strategy. Once everything is finalized, the recommendations of the consultancy company will be put in place and that will enhance the competitive position of our Bank in the industry. Going forward, the year 202223 and ahead are expected to be very challenging. Banks are especially expected to be challenged with the following realities i. The Council of Ministers of the F .D.R.E. has approved a new policy that will open up the banking industry to foreigners. Thus, a lot of foreign banks are expected to join the industry which will make the competition more stiff. ii. A number of new local banks have joined the industry in the fiscal year. Thus, business will not be as usual from now on and we need to tighten our belts for the upcoming fierce competition between local and foreign banks. iii. The 70 foreign currency surrender requirement will erode the foreign currency stocks of banks and as a result, the ever- increasing demands of importers may not be satisfactorily addressed and finally, 25 Nurturing Like the River Annual Report 202122 PICTORIAL PRESENTATION OF SHAREHOLDERS MEETING Partial View of 26th Ordinary Shareholders Meeting 26 Nurturing Like the River Annual Report 202122 PICTORIAL PRESENTATION OF MANAGEMENT MEETING, 202122 Partial View of Management Meeting, 202122 Awarded Best Performing Regions, RMs Branches Picture with the Bord of Director Management, 202122 27 Nurturing Like the River Annual Report 202122 T he Board of Directors of Awash Bank is honored to present the Banks Annual Report and Audited Financial Statements for the Financial Year ended June 30, 2022 to the 27th Annual General Meeting of its esteemed Shareholders. During the reporting period, Awash Bank continued to deliver superior operational and financial performances, in spite of slowdown in global economic growth and challenging domestic economic environments. During the financial year 202122, the world economy has been suffering from a series of destabilizing shocks. After more than two years of Covid 19 pandemic, the war between Russia and Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the Ukraine-Russia war has soared energy and agricultural commodity prices, exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging markets and developing economies EMDEs. The domestic macroeconomy was also challenged by double-digit inflation, shortage of foreign currency and internal conflicts in some parts of the country. Similarly, the banking industry has faced various challenges during FY 202122, including stiff competition among existing and new entrant banks, weak business environment and stringent policies by the National Bank of Ethiopia such as provisional suspension of collateral-based loan disbursements for about four months and 70 foreign exchange surrender requirements. 1. OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCES Awash Bank has registered another set of impressive operational and financial results during FY 202122, indicating the fact that the Bank is on the right track towards attaining its aspiration of becoming One of the Top Ten Private Banks in East Africa by 2025. Indeed, the Bank has cemented its leading position in key performance areas such as total deposits, total loans and advances, total assets, profit and capital base. 1.1 Deposits Mobilization Total deposits of the Bank, including LC margin and deposits from Interest Free Banking IFB rose to Birr 152 billion at the end of June 30,2022, up by Birr 43.9 billion 41 percent from last year same period. This commendable and consistent deposit growth of the Bank is attributed to the implementation of various strategic initiatives including expansion of service delivery channels and customer base, and offering of different deposit products to different customer segments. During FY 202122 alone, more than 2.6 million new customers have opened deposit accounts at Awash Bank. Deposits mobilized from Interest Free Banking line of business has witnessed encouraging performance and reached Birr 11.4 billion as at June 30, 2022 registering a net increment of Birr 3.9 billion 52 percent over previous year same period. Based on the strategic direction of the Bank to focus more on stable and low-cost deposits, saving deposits continued to account for the lions share 59.7 percent of the total deposit, followed by demand deposits 32.7 percent, time deposits 5 percent and letter of credit margin 2.6 percent.

"Awash Bank or the Bank" is a private commercial bank domiciled in Ethiopia. The Bank was established in November 1994, in accordance with the provisions of the Commercial Code of Ethiopia of 1960 and the Licensing and Supervision of Banking Business Proclamation No. 5922008. The Bank's registered office is at The Bank is principally engaged in the provision of diverse range of financial products and services to corporate, retail and SME clients base in Ethiopian market. Summary of significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. The financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2022 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards "IFRS" as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board "IASB". Additional information required by National regulations is included where appropriate. The financial statements comprise the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the statement of financial position, the statement of changes in equity, the statement of cash flows and the notes to the financial statements. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern principle under the historical cost concept, except for the following defined benefit pension plans plan assets measured at fair value. Equity investments which is measured at fair value. All values are rounded to the nearest thousand, except when otherwise indicated. The financial statements are presented in thousands of Ethiopian Birr ETB' 000. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Banks accounting policies. Changes in assumptions may have a significant impact on the financial statements in the period the assumptions changed. Management believes that the underlying assumptions are appropriate and that the Bank's financial statements, therefore, present the financial position and results fairly. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in Note 3. 13 61 Nurturing Like the River Annual Report 202122 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts IFRS 17 was issued in May 2017 as replacement for IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts. It requires a current measurement model where estimates are re-measured in each reporting period. The new rules will affect the financial statements and key performance indicators of all entities that issue insurance contracts or investment contracts with discretionary participation features. The standard Originally 1 January 2021, but extended to 1 January 2023 by the IASB in March 2020. amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7. This did not have an impact on the Banks financial statements as the Bank does not have hedging contracts. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The management have no doubt that the Bank would remain in existence after 12 months. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments clarifies which fees should be included in the 10 test for derecognition of financial liabilities. This change did not have an impact on the Banks financial statements.

Before recognising a separate provision for an onerous contract, the entity recognises any impairment loss that has occurred on assets used in fulfilling the contract. The standard effective on 1 January 2022. These standards are not expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions. Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current Amendments to IAS 1 The narrow-scope amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements clarify that liabilities are classified as either current or non- current, depending on the rights that exist at the end of the reporting period. Classification is unaffected by the expectations of the entity or events after the reporting date e.g., the receipt of a waver or a breach of covenant. The amendments also clarify what IAS 1 means when it refers to the settlement of a liability. The amendments could affect the classification of liabilities, particularly for entities that previously considered managements intentions to determine classification and for some liabilities that can be converted into equity. They must be applied retrospectively in accordance with the normal requirements in IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. The standard effective on 1 January 2022 deferred to 1 January 2023. Property, Plant and Equipment Proceeds before intended use Amendments to IAS 16 The amendment to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment PPE prohibits an entity from deducting from the cost of an item of PPE any proceeds received from selling items produced while the entity is preparing the asset for its intended use. It also clarifies that an entity is testing whether the asset is functioning properly when it assesses the technical and physical performance of the asset. The financial performance of the asset is not relevant to this assessment. Entities must disclose separately the amounts of proceeds and costs relating to items produced that are not an output of the entitys ordinary activities. The standard effective on 1 January 2022. Reference to the Conceptual Framework Amendments to IFRS 3 Minor amendments were made to IFRS 3 Business Combinations to update the references to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting and add an exception for the recognition of liabilities and contingent liabilities within the scope of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and Interpretation 21 Levies. The amendments also confirm that contingent assets should not be recognised at the acquisition date.

Any change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Banks OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the Bank recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Bank and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate. After application of the equity method, the Bank determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its associate. At each reporting date, the Bank determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Bank calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, then recognises the loss as Share of profit of an associate and a joint venture in the statement of profit or loss. Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Bank measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in statement of profit or loss. The following amended standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements of the Bank. Amendments to references to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards Sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 IFRS 3 Definition of a Business Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards An associate is an entity over which the Bank has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over those policies. The Banks investments in its associates are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Banks share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment. 16 64 Nurturing Like the River Annual Report 202122 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty. The Bank earns income from interest on loans and advances given to customers, service charges and commissions from customers, interest income from Deposits with local and correspondent banks, investment in NBE National Bank of Ethiopia bills. Other income includes incomes like foreign currency transactions, dividend, rental, and other miscellaneous incomes. Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Bank operates 'the functional currency'. The functional currency and presentation currency of the Bank is the Ethiopian Birr ETB. Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and from the translation at exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Bank's functional currency are recognised in profit or loss within other lossincome. Monetary items denominated in foreign currency are translated using the closing rate as at the reporting date. Changes in the fair value of monetary securities denominated in foreign currency classified as available for sale are analysed between translation differences resulting from changes in the amortised cost of the security and other changes in the carrying amount of the security. Translation differences related to changes in amortised cost are recognised in profit or loss, and other changes in carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at fair value, such as equities classified as FVOCI, are included in other comprehensive income. 17 65 Nurturing Like the River Annual Report 202122 Awash International Bank S.C.

Effective interest rate and amortised cost b. Amortised cost and gross carrying amount c. Calculation of interest income and expense the gross carrying amount of the financial asset the amortised cost of the financial liability. Summary of significant accounting policies continued However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis. For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the asset. The calculation of interest income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves. Interest income and expense are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset when the asset is not credit-impaired or to the amortised cost of the liability. When calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments other than credit-impaired assets, the Bank estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not expected credit losses. For credit-impaired financial assets, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate is calculated using estimated future cash flows including expected credit losses. The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, if the amount is material. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability. The amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance or impairment allowance before 1 July 2018. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance. 18 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

This is recognised when the Banks right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when the shareholders approve and declare the dividend. These are gains and losses arising on settlement and translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the functional currencys mid rate of exchange at the reporting date. This amount is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and it is further broken down into realised and unrealised portion. The monetary assets and liabilities include financial assets within the foreign currencies deposits received and held on behalf of third parties etc. Summary of significant accounting policies continued interest on financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost calculated on an effective interest basis interest on debt instruments measured at FVOCI calculated on an effective interest basis the effective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivatives designated in cash flow hedges of variability in interest cash flows, in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect interest incomeexpense and the effective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivatives designated in fair value hedges of interest rate risk. When a loan commitment is not expected to result in the draw-down of a loan, loan commitment fees are recognised on a straight-line basis over the commitment period.

Classification and subsequent measurement i Financial assets b. Classification and subsequent measurement In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI or at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise . All other financial assets that do not meet the classification criteria at amortised cost or FVOCI, above, shall be classified as measured at FVTPL. The Bank shall initially recognise loans and advances, deposits, debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities on the date on which they are originated. All other financial instruments including regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets shall be recognised on the trade date, which is the date on which the Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset or financial liability shall be measured initially at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. On initial recognition, a financial asset shall be classified either as measured at either amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI or fair value through profit or loss FVTPL. The Bank shall measure a financial asset at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated at FVTPL Summary of significant accounting policies continued On initial recognition, an equity investment that is held for trading shall be classified at FVTPL. However, for equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest SPPI. A debt instrument shall be measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated at FVTPL the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI. 20 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Bank considers For the purposes of this assessment, principal shall be defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. Interest shall be defined as the consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs, as well as profit margin. the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular, whether managements strategy focuses on earning contractual interest revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Banks management the risks that affect the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model and its strategy for how those risks are managed how managers of the business are compensated e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected and the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Banks stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised. Summary of significant accounting policies continued Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis shall be measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. Financial assets shall not be reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Bank changes its business model for managing financial assets. The Bank shall make an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes 21 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

At each reporting date, the Bank shall assess whether there is objective evidence that financial assets except equity investments, other than those carried at FVTPL, are impaired. Summary of significant accounting policies continued Financial guarantees issued by the Bank are initially measured at their fair values and, if not designated as at FVTPL, are subsequently measured at the higher of the amount of the obligation under the guarantee, as determined in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with the revenue recognition policies. The Bank shall recognise loss allowances for expected credit losses ECL on the following financial instruments that are not measured at FVTPL debt investment securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other financial instruments other than lease receivables on which credit risk has not increased significantly since their initial recognition. financial assets that are debt instruments lease receivables financial guarantee contracts issued and loan commitments issued. No impairment loss shall be recognised on equity investments. The Bank shall classify its financial liabilities, other than financial guarantees and loan commitments, as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial guarantee is an undertakingcommitment that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified party fails to meet its obligation when due in accordance with the contractual terms. 22 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset. ECL is a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. It shall be measured as follows Summary of significant accounting policies continued Loss allowances for lease receivables shall always be measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. 12-month ECL is the portion of ECL that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Financial instruments for which a 12-month ECL is recognised are referred to as Stage 1 financial instruments. Life-time ECL is the ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument.

A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrowers condition shall be considered to be credit-impair unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more shall be considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different. Summary of significant accounting policies continued for financial assets measured at amortised cost as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets for loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts generally, as a provision where a financial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Bank cannot identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from those on the drawn component the Bank presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The combined amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision and for debt instruments measured at FVOCI no loss allowance is recognised in the statement of financial position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance shall be disclosed and is recognised in the fair value reserve. At each reporting date, the Bank shall assess whether financial assets carried at amortised cost, debt financial assets carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit impaired referred to as Stage 3 financial assets. A financial asset shall be considered credit impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. 24 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

The Bank shall assess whether a financial guarantee contract held is an integral element of a financial asset that is accounted for as a component of that instrument or is a contract that is accounted for separately. Summary of significant accounting policies continued Loans and debt securities shall be written off either partially or in full when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the amount in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Bank determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment shall be carried out at the individual asset level. The Bank shall derecognise a financial asset when Where the Bank determines that the guarantee is not an integral element of the debt instrument, then it shall recognise an asset representing any prepayment of guarantee premium and a right to compensation for credit losses. Where the Bank determines that the guarantee is an integral element of the financial asset, then any premium payable in connection with the initial recognition of the financial asset shall be treated as a transaction cost of acquiring it. The Bank shall consider the effect of the protection when measuring the fair value of the debt instrument and when measuring ECL. Recoveries of amounts previously written off shall be included in impairment losses on financial instruments in the statement of profit or loss and OCI. Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Banks procedures for recovery of amounts due. 25 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

Modifications of financial assets and financial liabilities i Financial assets fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs shall be included in the initial measurement of the asset and other fees are included in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition. If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the Bank plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it shall first consider whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. Where the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the Bank shall first recalculate the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognises the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. Any costs or fees incurred and fees received as part of the modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and shall be amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset. Any interest in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Bank shall be recognised as a separate asset or liability. If the terms of a financial asset are modified, then the Bank shall evaluate whether the cash flows of the modified asset are substantially different. On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised and the sum of i the consideration received including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed and ii any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI shall be recognised in profit or loss.

The Bank shall derecognise a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset shall be deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset shall be derecognised see 1.3 and a new financial asset shall be recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs.

Where such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower, then the gain or loss shall be presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it shall be presented as interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method. The Bank shall derecognise a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms shall be recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. Consideration paid shall include non-financial assets transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability. Financial assets and financial liabilities shall be offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Bank currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Summary of significant accounting policies continued Where the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost of the liability shall be recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any costs and fees incurred are recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial liability by re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument. 27 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

They are disclosed when reclassified during the year. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows The Bank construct buildings in different cities mainly for image building, branches office and issue accounts use. The remaining is rented out. If the building is rented up to 90 of the floor of the building, the building shall be treated as PPE. If the building is rented out for more than 90 of the floor of the building, we ought to transfer it to Investment property IP. Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Bank recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in statement of profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying value or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. Summary of significant accounting policies continued An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value of the asset is included in statement of profit or loss. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. 29 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in statement of profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred . The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life, or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset, are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or methodology, as appropriate, which are then treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expenses on intangible assets with finite lives are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss, if significant. Amortisation is calculated using the straightline method to write down the cost of intangible assets to their residual values over the lower of their estimated useful lives of six years orbthe license duration for purchased computer software. The Bank assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Bank estimates the assets recoverable amount. An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units CGU fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. The Bank bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Banks CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. 30 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

If such indication exists, the Bank estimates the assets or CGUs recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Other assets are generally defined as claims held against other entities for the future receipt of money. The other assets in the Bank's financial statements include the following Summary of significant accounting policies continued Prepayments are payments made in advance for services to be enjoyed in future. The amount is initially capitalized in the reporting period in which the payment is made and subsequently amortised over the period in which the service is to be enjoyed. Other receivables are recognised upon the occurrence of an event or transaction as they arise and are cancelled when payment is received. The Bank measures financial instruments classified as available-for-sale at fair value at each statement of financial position date. Fair value related disclosures for financial instruments and non-financial assets that are measured at fair value or where fair values are disclosed are, summarised in the following notes Disclosures for valuation methods, significant estimates and assumptions Notes 3 and Note 4.7.1 Quantitative disclosures of fair value measurement hierarchy Note 4.7.2 Financial instruments including those carried at amortised cost Note 4.7.2 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either In the principal market for the asset or liability, or In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. 31 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

Wages, salaries, other allowances, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Bank. The Bank operates an accumulating leave policy this can be encashed when the employee is leaving employment or paid in cash if the bank rarely decides to pay in cash. The Bank measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount that the entity expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end of each reporting period. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. The Bank uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole Level 1 Quoted unadjusted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable. Level 3 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Bank determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period. The Banks management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement, such as available-for-sale financial assets.

The Bank operates two defined contribution plans i pension scheme in line with the provisions of Ethiopian Pension of Private Organisation Employees Proclamation No. 7152011. Funding under the scheme is 7 and 11 by employees and the Bank respectively 2 provident fund contribution is made by the bank for employees covered under pension scheme. ii provident fund contribution, funding under this scheme is 7 and 13 by employees and the Bank respectively based on the employees' salary. Employer's contributions to this scheme are charged to profit or loss and other comprehensive income in the period to which they relate. The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognised in the statement of profit or loss in employee benefit expense, except where included in the cost of an asset, reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes curtailments and settlements. Past-service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Termination benefits are payable to executive directors when employment is terminated by the Bank before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Bank recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.

When the Bank expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in statement of profit or loss net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as other operating expenses. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The legal reserve which is a statutory reserve to which no less than 25 of the net profits after taxation shall be transferred each year until such fund is equal to the capital. When the legal reserve equals the capital of the Bank, the amount to be transferred to the legal reserve account shall be 10 of the annual net profit. Profit-sharing and bonus plans The Bank recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to the companys shareholders after certain adjustments. The Bank recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation. Summary of significant accounting policies continued The Bank presents basic earnings per share for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Bank by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Bank allocates consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone price. However, for leases of branches and office premises the Bank has elected not to separate non-lease components and accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. 34 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Banks estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Bank changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment. The Bank recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of- use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove any improvements made to branches or office premises. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. Summary of significant accounting policies continued Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. The Bank presents right-of-use assets in property and equipment and lease liabilities in other liabilities in the statement of financial position. The Bank determines its incremental borrowing rate by analysing its borrowings from various external sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of asset leased. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Banks incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Bank uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. 35 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

The Bank further regularly reviews estimated unguaranteed residual values used in calculating the gross investment in the lease. When the Bank acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether the lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Bank makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Bank considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset. The income tax expense or credit for the year is the tax payable on the current years taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in Ethiopia. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. Deferred tax is recognised as temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. At inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Bank allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone selling prices.

The Bank based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances beyond the control of the Bank. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur. Judgments In the process of applying the Banks accounting policies, management has made the following judgments, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements Lease commitments - Bank as lessee The Bank has entered into commercial property leases. The Bank has determined, based on an evaluation of the terms and conditions of the arrangements, such as the lease term not constituting a substantial portion of the economic life of the commercial property, that it does not retain all the significant risks and rewards of ownership of these properties and accounts for the contracts as leases. The preparation of the Banks financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets or liabilities affected in future periods. Other disclosures relating to the Banks exposure to risks and uncertainties include Capital management Note 4.6 Financial risk management and policies Note 4 Estimates and assumptions The Banks management has made an assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern and is satisfied that it has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, management is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Banks ability to continue as a going concern, except that it has to make significant effort to reach the minimum capital requirement. However, the financial statements continue to be prepared on going concern basis. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions 37 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2022 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 3 3.2 a b Impairment losses on loans and receivables The Bank reviews its loan portfolios for impairment on an on-going basis. The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for loans and receivables that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for loans and receivables that are not individually significant. Impairment provisions are also recognised for losses not specifically identified but which, experience and observable data indicate are present in the portfolio at the date of assessment. For individually significant loans and receivables that have been deemed to be impaired, management deems that the cash flow from collateral would arise within one year where the loans and receivables is back by collateral. Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the portfolio when scheduling its future cash flows. The methodology and assumptions used for estimating both the amount and timing of future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience. The use of historical loss experience is supplemented with significant management judgment to assess whether current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual level of inherent losses is likely to differ from that suggested by historical experience. In normal circumstances, historical experience provides objective and relevant information from which to assess inherent loss within each portfolio. In other circumstances, historical loss experience provides less relevant information about the inherent loss in a given portfolio at the balance sheet date, for example, where there have been changes in economic conditions such that the most recent trends in risk factors are not fully reflected in the historical information. In these circumstances, such risk factors are taken into account when calculating the appropriate levels of impairment allowances, by adjusting the impairment loss derived solely from historical loss experience. The detailed methodologies, areas of estimation and judgment applied in the calculation of the Bank's impairment charge on financial assets are set out in the financial risk management section. The estimation of impairment losses is subject to uncertainty, which has increased in the current economic environment and is highly sensitive to factors such as the level of economic activity, unemployment rates, property price trends and interest rates. The assumptions underlying this judgement are highly subjective. The methodology and the assumptions used in calculating impairment losses are reviewed regularly in the light of differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience. See note 3.2 for more information. Fair value measurement of financial instruments When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the statement of financial position cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow DCF model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required in establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. As at year end, no financial instrument was measured at fair value. See Note 4.7.1 for further disclosures.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2022 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 3 3.2 c d e f Income Taxes Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The fair value less costs of disposal calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions, conducted at arms length, for similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a DCF model. The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Bank is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the assets performance of the CGU being tested. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. Defined benefit plans The cost of the defined benefit pension plan, long service awards and gratuity scheme and the present value of these defined benefit obligations are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. Depreciation and carrying value of property, plant and equipment The estimation of the useful lives and residual values of assets is based on managements judgement. Any material adjustment to the estimated useful lives of items of property and equipment will have an impact on the carrying value of these items.

This process of risk management is critical to the Banks continuing profitability and each individual within the Bank is accountable for the risk exposures relating to his or her responsibilities. The Bank is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and different operational risks. It is also subject to various risks that affect the financial sector of the country. The independent risk control process does not include business risks such as changes in the environment, technology and industry. The Bank's policy is to monitor those business risks through the Banks strategic planning process. The Board Risk Sub-Committee, a subset of the Board of Directors is responsible for the overall risk management approach and for approving the risk management strategies and principles. It also has the responsibility to monitor the overall risk process within the Bank. The Senior Management chaired by the chief Executive Officer CEO has the overall responsibility for the development of the risk strategy and implementing principles, frameworks, policies and limits. It is also responsible for managing risk decisions and monitoring risk levels and reports on a monthly basis to the Board Risk Sub- Committee. The Risk Management Unit is responsible for implementing and maintaining risk related procedures to ensure an independent control process is maintained. The unit works closely with the Senior Management to ensure that procedures are compliant with the overall framework. The Risk Management Unit is responsible for monitoring compliance with risk principles, policies and limits across the Bank. It carries out an assessment of risk on an ad hoc basis to monitor the Bank's independent control of risks, including monitoring the risk of exposures against limits and the assessment of risks of new products and structured transactions. This unit also ensures the complete capture of the risks in risk measurement and reporting systems. Exceptions are reported, where necessary, to the Senior Management, and further to the Board Risk Sub-Committee and the relevant actions are taken to address exceptions and any areas of weakness. The Bank Finance and Treasury function is responsible for managing the Banks financial assets, financial liabilities and the overall financial structure. It is also primarily responsible for the funding and liquidity risks of the Bank. The Banks policy is that risk management processes throughout the Bank are audited annually by the Internal Audit Function, which examines both the adequacy of the procedures and the Banks compliance with the procedures. The Internal Audit Function discusses the results of all assessments with management, and reports its findings and recommendations to the Board Audit Sub-Committee. 40 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

The models make use of probabilities derived from historical experience, adjusted to reflect the economic environment. The Bank also runs worst-case scenarios that would arise in the event that extreme events, which are unlikely to occur, do in fact, occur. Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily performed based on limits established by the Bank. These limits reflect the business strategy and market environment of the Bank as well as the level of risk that the Bank is willing to accept, with additional emphasis on selected regions. In addition, the Banks policy is to measure and monitor the overall risk bearing capacity in relation to the aggregate risk exposure across all risk types and activities. Risk controls and mitigates, identified and approved for the Bank, are documented for existing and new processes and systems. The adequacy of these mitigates is tested on a periodic basis through administration of control self-assessment questionnaires, using an operational risk management tool which requires risk owners to confirm the effectiveness of established controls. These are subsequently audited as part of the review process. The Bank's financial assets are classified into the following measurement categories Financial assets at fair value through OCI and Financial assets at amortized cost and the financial liabilities are classified into other liabilities at amortised cost. Financial instruments are classified in the statement of financial position in accordance with their legal form and substance. - Financial assets at amortized cost 41 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

Our credit exposure comprises wholesale and retail Financial assets at amortized cost which are developed to reflect the needs of our customers. The Banks policy is to lend principally on the basis of our customers repayment capacity through quantitative and qualitative evaluation. However we ensure that our loans are backed by collateral to reflect the risk of the obligors and the nature of the facility. Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Bank if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Banks loans and advances to customers and other banks and other financial assets. Exposure to credit risk is managed through periodic analysis of the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to determine their capacity to meet principal and interest thereon, and restructuring such limits as appropriate. Exposure to credit risk is also mitigated, in part, by obtaining collateral, commercial and personal guarantees . The Bank structures the levels of credit risk it undertakes by placing limits on the amount of risk accepted in relation to one borrower, or groups of borrowers, and to term of the financial instrument and economic sectors. The National Bank of Ethiopia NBE sets credit risk limit for a single borrower, one related party and all related parties to not exceed 25, 5 and 35 of Banks total capital amount as of the reporting quarterly period respectively. Credit management is conducted as per the risk management policy and guideline approved by the board of directors and the Risk Management Committees. Such policies are reviewed and modified periodically based on changes and expectations of the markets where the Bank operates, regulations, and other factors. 42 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

However, collateral provides additional security and the Bank generally requests that corporate borrowers provide it. The Bank may take collateral in the form of a first charge over real estate, floating charges over all corporate assets and other liens and guarantees. Because of the Banks focus on customers creditworthiness, the Bank does not routinely update the valuation of collateral held against all loans to customers. Valuation of collateral of real estates buildings is updated and reviewed every three year and at the same time whenever the loan foreclosure measure is opted. For credit- impaired loans, the Bank obtains appraisals of collateral because it provides input into determining the management credit risk actions. AS at 30 June 2022, the net carrying amount of credit impaired loans and advances to customers amounted to ETB 2.440 billion 2021 ETB 1.247 billion and the value of identifiable collateral held against those loans and advances amounted to ETB 4.779 billion 2021 ETB 2.835 million. For each loan, the value of disclosed collateral is capped at the nominal amount of the loan that it is held against. As at 30 June 2022, the Bank had no exposure to credit risk of the investment securities designated as at FVTPL. Amounts arising from ECL ii Significant increase in credit risk When determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Bank considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Banks historical experience and expert credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The objective of the assessment is to identify whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred for an exposure by comparing 50 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2022 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 4 Financial risk management Continued 4.3 Credit risk Continued 4.3.6 iii Credit risk grades The Bank allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on a variety of data that is determined to be predictive of the risk of default and applying experienced credit judgement. Credit risk grades are defined using qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of risk of default. These factors vary depending on the nature of the exposure and the type of borrower. Credit risk grades are defined and calibrated such that the risk of default occurring increases exponentially as the credit risk deteriorates so, for example, the difference in risk of default between credit risk grades 1 and 2 is smaller than the difference between credit risk grades 2 and 3. Each exposure is allocated to a credit risk grade on initial recognition based on available information about the borrower. Exposures are subject to ongoing monitoring, which may result in an exposure being moved to a different credit risk grade. The monitoring typically involves use of the following data a. Term loan exposures Information obtained during periodic review of customer files e.g. audited financial statements, management accounts, budgets and projections. Examples of areas of particular focus are gross profit margins, financial leverage ratios, debt service coverage, compliance Data from credit reference agencies, press articles, changes in external credit ratings Actual and expected significant changes in the political, regulatory and technological environment of the borrower or in its business activities Internally collected data on customer behaviour e.g. utilisation of credit card facilities Affordability metrics Payment record this includes overdue status as well as a range of variables about payment ratios Utilisation of the granted limit Requests for and granting of forbearance Existing and forecast changes in business, financial and economic conditions Amounts arising from ECL Continued Credit risk grades are a primary input into the determination of the term structure of PD for exposures. The Bank collects performance and default information about its credit risk exposures analysed by type of product and borrower as well as by credit risk grading. The Bank employs statistical models to analyse the data collected and generate estimates of the remaining lifetime PD of exposures and how these are expected to change as a result of the passage of time. b.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2022 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 4 Financial risk management Continued 4.3 Credit risk Continued 4.3.6 As a backstop, the Bank considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when an asset is more than 30 days past due. Days past due are determined by counting the number of days since the earliest elapsed due date in respect of which full payment has not been received. Due dates are determined without considering any grace period that might be available to the borrower. The Bank monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify significant increases in credit risk by regular reviews to confirm that there is no unwarranted volatility in loss allowance from transfers between 12-month PD Stage 1 and lifetime PD Stage 2. The Bank considers a financial asset to be in default when vi Definition of default If there is evidence that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk relative to initial recognition, then the loss allowance on an instrument returns to being measured as 12-month ECL. Some qualitative indicators of an increase in credit risk, such as delinquency or forbearance, may be indicative of an increased risk of default that persists after the indicator itself has ceased to exist. In these cases, the Bank determines a probation period during which the financial asset is required to demonstrate good behaviour to provide evidence that its credit risk has declined sufficiently. When contractual terms of a loan have been modified, evidence that the criteria for recognising lifetime ECL are no longer met includes a history of up-to-date payment performance against the modified contractual terms. the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank in full, without recourse by the Bank to actions such as realising security if any is held Overdrafts are considered as being past due once the customer has breached an advised limit or been advised of a limit smaller than the current amount outstanding or it is becoming probable that the borrower will restructure the asset as a result of bankruptcy due to the borrowers inability to pay its credit obligations. The Bank assesses whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition at each reporting date. Determining whether an increase in credit risk is significant depends on the characteristics of the financial instrument and the borrower. The credit risk may also be deemed to have increased significantly since initial recognition based on qualitative factors linked to the Banks credit risk management processes that may not otherwise be fully reflected in its quantitative analysis on a timely basis. This will be the case for exposures that meet certain heightened risk criteria, such as placement on a watch list. Such qualitative factors are based on its expert judgment and relevant historical experiences. v Determining whether credit risk has increased significantly Amounts arising from ECL Continued 52 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

Amounts arising from ECL Continued Periodically, the Bank carries out stress testing of more extreme shocks to calibrate its determination of the upside and downside representative scenarios. A comprehensive review is performed at least annually on the design of the scenarios by a panel of experts that advises the Banks senior management. In assessing whether a borrower is in default, the Bank considers indicators that are Inputs into the assessment of whether a financial instrument is in default and their significance may vary over time to reflect changes in circumstances. vii Incorporation of forward-looking information Continued vii Incorporation of forward-looking information The Bank incorporates forward-looking information into both the assessment of whether the credit risk of an instrument has increased significantly since its initial recognition and the measurement of ECL. For each segment, the Bank formulates three economic scenarios a base case, which is the median scenario, and two less likely scenarios, one upside and one downside. For each sector, the base case is aligned with the macroeconomic models information value output, a measure of the predictive power of the model, as well as base macroeconomic projections for identified macroeconomic variables for each sector. The upside and downside scenarios are based on a combination of a percentage error factor of each sector model as well as simulated optimistic and pessimistic macroeconomic projections based on a measure of historical macroeconomic volatilities. The Bank has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for each portfolio of financial instruments and, using an analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between macro-economic variables and credit risk and credit losses. External information considered includes economic data and forecasts published by Business Monitor International, an external and independent macroeconomic data body. This is in addition to industry level, semi annual NPL trends across statistically comparable sectors. 53 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

A customer needs to demonstrate consistently good payment behaviour over a period of time before the exposure is no longer considered to be credit- impairedin default or the PD is considered to have decreased such that the loss allowance reverts to being measured at an amount equal to Stage 1. Scenario probability weightings As at June 2022 As at June 2021 The contractual terms of a loan may be modified for a number of reasons, including changing market conditions, customer retention and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of the customer. An existing loan whose terms have been modified may be derecognised and the renegotiated loan recognised as a new loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy set out. The Bank renegotiates loans to customers in financial difficulties referred to as forbearance activities to maximise collection opportunities and minimise the risk of default. Under the Banks forbearance policy, loan forbearance is granted on a selective basis if the debtor is currently in default on its debt or if there is a high risk of default, there is evidence that the debtor made all reasonable efforts to pay under the original contractual terms and the debtor is expected to be able to meet the revised terms. The revised terms usually include extending the maturity, changing the timing of interest payments and amending the terms of loan covenants. Both retail and corporate loans are subject to the forbearance policy. The Bank Credit Committee regularly reviews reports on forbearance activities. For financial assets modified as part of the Banks forbearance policy, the estimate of PD reflects whether the modification has improved or restored the Banks ability to collect interest and principal and the Banks previous experience of similar forbearance action. As part of this process, the Bank evaluates the borrowers payment performance against the modified contractual terms and considers various behavioural indicators. viii Modified financial assets When the terms of a financial asset are modified and the modification does not result in derecognition, the determination of whether the assets credit risk has increased significantly reflects comparison of its remaining lifetime PD at the reporting date based on the modified terms with the remaining lifetime PD estimated based on data on initial recognition and the original contractual terms. Amounts arising from ECL Continued When modification results in derecognition, a new loan is recognised and allocated to Stage 1 assuming it is not credit-impaired at that time. 55 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2022 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 4 Financial risk management Continued 4.3 Credit risk Continued 4.3.6 The key inputs into the measurement of ECL are the term structure of the following variables Probability of default PD loss given default LGD and exposure at default EAD As described above, and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for Stage 1 financial assets, the Bank measures ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period including any borrowers extension options over which it is exposed to credit risk, even if, for credit risk management purposes, the Bank considers a longer period. The maximum contractual period extends to the date at which the Bank has the right to require repayment of an advance or terminate a loan commitment or guarantee. However, for overdrafts that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment component, the Bank measures ECL over a period longer than the maximum contractual period if the Banks contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the Banks exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period. These facilities do not have a fixed term or repayment structure and are managed on a collective basis. The Bank can cancel them with immediate effect but this contractual right is not enforced in the normal day-to-day management, but only when the Bank becomes aware of an increase in credit risk at the facility level. This longer period is estimated taking into account the credit risk management actions that the Bank expects to take, and that serve to mitigate ECL. These include a reduction in limits, cancellation of the facility andor turning the outstanding balance into a loan with fixed repayment terms. ix Measurement of ECL EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Bank derives the EAD from the current exposure to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract and arising from amortisation. The EAD of a financial asset is its gross carrying amount at the time of default. For lending commitments, the EADs are potential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated based on historical observations and forward-looking forecasts. For financial guarantees, the EAD represents the amount of the guaranteed exposure when the financial guarantee becomes payable. For some financial assets, EAD is determined by modelling the range of possible exposure outcomes at various points in time using scenario and statistical techniques. LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Bank estimates LGD parameters based on the history of recovery rates of claims against defaulted counterparties. The LGD models consider the structure, collateral, seniority of the claim, counterparty industry and recovery costs of any collateral that is integral to the financial asset. Amounts arising from ECL Continued The methodology of estimating PDs is discussed above under the heading Generating the term structure of PD. ECL for exposures in Stage 1 is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD by LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated by multiplying the lifetime PD by LGD and EAD. 56 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

The maximum exposure to credit risk relating to a loan commitment is the full amount of the commitment. The table below shows the Banks maximum credit risk exposure for commitments and guarantees. Loans with renegotiated terms Loans with renegotiated terms are defined as loans that have been restructured due to a deterioration in the borrowers financial position, for which the Bank has made concessions by agreeing to terms and conditions that are more favourable for the borrower than the Bank had provided initially and that it would not otherwise consider. A loan continues to be presented as part of loans with renegotiated terms until maturity, early repayment or write-off. Loans that were past due but not impaired Loans that were past due but not impaired are those for which contractual interest or principal payments were past due but the Bank believed that impairment was not appropriate on the basis of the level of security or collateral available andor the stage of collection of amounts owed to the Bank.

The cash flows presented are the undiscounted amounts to be settled in future. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank cannot meet its maturing obligations when they become due, at reasonable cost and in a timely manner. Liquidity risk arises because of the possibility that the Bank might be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due as a result of mismatches in the timing of the cash flows under both normal and stress circumstances. Such scenarios could occur when funding needed for illiquid asset positions is not available to the Bank on acceptable terms. Liquidity risk management in the Bank is solely determined by the Asset and Liability Committee ALCO, which bears the overall responsibility for liquidity risk. The main objective of the Bank's liquidity risk framework is to maintain sufficient liquidity in order to ensure that we meet our maturing obligations. Assets held for managing liquidity risk Cash flow forecasting is performed by the Finance and Treasury function. The Finance and Treasury function monitors rolling forecasts of liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs. The Bank has incurred indebtedness in the form of borrowings. The Bank evaluates its ability to meet its obligations on an ongoing basis. Based on these evaluations, the Bank devises strategies to manage its liquidity risk. Prudent liquidity risk management implies that sufficient cash is maintained and that sufficient funding is available to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk of damage to the Banks reputation. 61 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

Market risk is defined as the risk of loss that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market risk factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads and their volatilities. Market risk can arise in conjunction with trading and non-trading activities of a financial institutions. The Bank does not ordinarily engage in trading activities as there are no active markets in Ethiopia. The main objective of Market Risk Management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. Assets held for managing liquidity risk Total financial liabilities Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will be affected by changes in market interest rates. Borrowings and lending obtained at variable rates give rise to interest rate risk. The Banks exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Banks obligations and financial assets with floating interest rates. The Bank is also exposed on fixed rate financial assets and financial liabilities. The Banks investment portfolio is comprised of treasury bills, Ethiopian government bonds and cash deposits. 62 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources unobservable inputs reflect the Bank's market assumptions. - Financial assets at amortized cost Loans and advances to customers The following table summarises the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts are based on the values recognised in the statement of financial position. Level 1 Inputs that are quoted market prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i.e. as prices or indirectly i.e. derived from prices .This category includes instruments valued using quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active, another valuation technique in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data. In conclusion, this category is for valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable. Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs. This category includes all assets and liabilities for which the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the asset's or liability's valuation.

The employee benefit plan is made up of two 2 unfunded schemes which are severance benefits that are paid on voluntary withdrawal and retirement gratuity paid on retirement. These plans have been aggregated in determining the retirement benefit obligation as the inherent risks applicable to these plans have been assessed not to be materially different. The key financial assumptions are the discount rate and the rate of salary increases. The provision for gratuity was based on an independent actuarial valuation performed by QED Actuaries Consultants Pty Ltd using the projected unit credit method. The Bank does not maintain any assets for the schemes but ensures that it has sufficient funds for the obligations as they crystallise. 87 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

Employees who attain this age while in a managerial position are entitled to 3 months final monthly salary while for other employees, it is 2 months final salary. The scheme is not funded hence, there are no plan assets. Bank Paid Benefits The bank valued severance benefits payable on death or resignation after a minimum of 5 years service only for all employees, as it is applied by the Bank. Furthermore, one months salary is divided by 30 to get the daily salary applied in the severance benefit calculation. The severance benefits are based on statutory severance benefits in Ethiopia. The statutory severance benefits are set out in Labour Proclamation No. 11562019. This benefit is summarised below Clause 39 1 h of the Labour Proclamation sets out that any worker who has completed their probation and who is not eligible for pension is entitled to a severance benefit h Where he has given service to the employer for a minimum of five years service and his contract of employment is terminated because of sickness or death or his contract of employment is terminated on his own initiative provided that he has no contractual obligation relating to training to render service to the employer Clause 40 of the Labour Proclamation sets out the amount of the benefit, as follows The benefit applicable would be thirty times the average daily wages of their last week of service for the first year of service, with part- years pro-rata, plus ten times the average daily wages of their last week of service for each completed year of service after the first. To a maximum of one years wages payable to the member.Where the Company closes or reduces its work force, an additional multiple of sixty times the average daily wages of their last week of service is payable. 88 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.

Provisions under prudential guidelines are determined using the time based provisioning prescribed by the National Bank of Ethiopia NBE Directives. This is at variance with the expected credit loss model required by IFRS under IFRS 9. As a result of the differences in the provision, there will be variances in the impairments allowances required under the two methodologies. Similarly, interest on non-performing loans are suspended as per NBE directive, while IFRS 9 prescribes to recognize stage 3 loans interest income net of impairement losses. The proclamation Financial Reporting Proclamation No.8472014 stipulates that Banks would be required to make provisions for financial assets as prescribed in the relevant IFRS Standards when IFRS is adopted. However, Banks would be required to comply with the following a Provisions for loans advances and other assets are recognised in the income statement based on the requirements of IFRS. However, the IFRS provision should be compared with provisions determined under the NBE Directives and the expected impactchanges in other reserves are treated as follows Prudential provisions is greater than IFRS provisions the excess resulting should be transferred from the general reserve retained earnings account to a regulatory risk reserve. Interest suspended in the previous years and regularized in the current year is compared with current year stage 3 loans interest income recognized net of impairment losses. The difference between the two is transferred to regulatory risk reserve. Prudential provisions is less than IFRS provisions IFRS determined provision is charged to the statement of comprehensive income. The cumulative balance in the regulatory risk reserve is thereafter reversed to the general reserve account. 93 AWASH INTERNATIONAL BANK S.C.
