As the government furthers its reform objectives, various policy reforms actions were rolled out during the ﬁscal year. Signiﬁcant among these included the National Bank of Ethiopias measures aimed at enhancing ﬁnancial sector stability which introduced new directives in the areas of limiting large borrower exposures, exposure to related parties, asset classiﬁcation and provisioning, persons of signiﬁcant inﬂuence, and bank corporate governance. These revised directives would play important roles in instituting more prudence in the banks practices as well as strengthening the framework of the ﬁnancial sector oversight. More of such change initiatives are expected to emerge as the National Bank of Ethiopia rolls out its strategic plan implementation, that includes framework development for creation of enabling environment for the potential introduction of a central bank digital currency CBDC. Other reform steps involve the increase in momentum of the opening up of the banking business for foreign investors and the establishment of a functioning capital market. On behalf of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Abyssinia S.C and myself, it is my honor to present the Board of Directors report along with the Audited Financial Statements of the Bank to the 28th Ordinary Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of the Bank for the Fiscal Year 202324 that ended June 30, 2024. In the Fiscal Year 202324, the global economy continued to face challenges that passed through from preceding years, including slower activities following the central banks policy tightening to ﬁght inﬂations, varied momentum in activity across economies, and geopolitical developments. Nonetheless, the world economy largely remained resilient, as the efforts of central banks in abating inﬂation bore fruit and global activity and world trade ﬁrmed up IMF WEO update, July 2024. The global economic growth rate is estimated to have slowed slightly to 3.2 in 2024 from 3.3 in 2023 in escalating trade tensions and increased policy uncertainty. The Ethiopian economy has also gone through challenges wherein domestic and external shocks that prevailed in the past two years have affected the overall activities and growth. Faced with such challenges as lack of peace and security, persistent inﬂation, foreign exchange shortage, and drought prevalence, the economy remained resilient and showed positive growth. Annual Report 202324 Annual Report 202324 12 13 DEAR SHAREHOLDERS, Despite challenges in the overall economy and major changes in the ﬁnancial sector, Bank of Abyssinia maintained its balance sheet growth momentum. In the reporting period, the Banks assets grew by 17.30 and maintained proﬁtability, and this is commendable given the multiple shocks that the economy experienced with a notable repercussion on the banking industry. Total assets reached Birr 222.30 billion, while the Bank earned a gross proﬁt before tax of Birr 5.28 billion. Deposits increased by Birr 33.97 billion, which is a 21.43 growth over that of the preceding year, and the total deposits amount was raised to Birr 192.51 billion as at June 30, 2024. Total loans and advances increased by 14.49 from last years position and reached Birr 167.74 billion PI. The Banks interest free banking business has continued to register remarkable growth. During the year, the Bank mobilized a total of Birr 6.07 billion in IFB deposits, which brought total IFB deposits to Birr 24.14 billion. In addition, the Bank has been increasing its interest free ﬁnancing products, and outstanding ﬁnancing has become Birr 4.91 billion as at June 30, 2024. The Bank shall continue to further strengthen IFB services with more innovative products and service offerings tailored to the needs and preferences of customers. The number and composition of service outlets across the Bank in which the Bank extends the IFB services have increased over time accompanied by enhanced operational efficiency and service excellence. As part of its plan of expanding business reach, the Bank has continued to increase its service outlets both in the physical and digital channels which saw a considerable growth during the year. The Bank continues to bring forth modern digital banking solutions and products which are value-adding to customers and new to the market. In one of such cases, the Bank of Abyssinia has pioneered in introducing a digital visa card wherein customers are enabled to use their mobile phones as a visa card to conduct transaction, on Banks ATMs and PoS terminals, using the Apollo digital bank platform. A number of other solutions that are aimed at creating convenience to individual users as well as delivering business process solutions to customers, such as a comprehensive school management solution, have been successfully implemented and are delivering value to the Banks esteemed customers. Towards enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in its IT and digital banking undertakings, the Bank has also implemented, a few among the notable ones included, full roll out of identity management solution, loan origination and instant loan solution, and data lifecycle management. Such investments have proven to be boosting the Banks processes and systems performances to a greater extent. The Bank also further upgraded its PCI DSS certiﬁcation to the highest level and latest version. As the PCI DSS is a continuous engagement, the Bank proceeds with the security exercises and remains compliant. Besides, the Bank has implemented a set of IT security management programs that would enable the safe conduct of the Banks business. Utmost attention is placed towards the human resource which, we believe, is the most important resource of the Bank. In this regard, the Bank has implemented a number of strategic initiatives and programs to develop and empower the workforce, and in providing convenient working environment. The Bank has achieved a lot of progress in implementing a range of HR development programs. These implemented programs are of paramount importance in building organizational capability which play a critical role in meeting its long term goals and aspirations. During the year, the Board, together with the Executive Management, have collectively invested time and energy in navigating through the tough environment, wherein the Bank has come out resilient and upheld the growth momentum. The Board remains committed to sustain delivering on the Banks strategic objectives and the highest of values to stakeholders in the future too. Honorable Shareholders, Mekonnen Manyazewal Chairman of the Board The Bank recognizes the changes in the overall environment which ushered in fast-paced changes, and proactively working towards addressing the possible side effects while striving to seize opportunities. The Board remains ﬁrm in its guidance and strategic direction as well as in oversight of risk management and ensuring sound practices, in the face of newly introduced regulatory requirements, changes in legislations relevant to the Bank and in overcoming challenges in relation to changes in technological and market forces. In the years ahead, the Bank sees positive prospects for the Banks growth as the Bank strengthens its delivering capability built up through the years. In the wake of conclusion of the previous strategic plan implementation, the Bank has now crafted a new Five-Year Strategy to be rolled out and implemented in a renewed team spirit and dedication. By drawing from lessons of the Banks past implementation journey and building upon internal strength, it is with high hope and anticipation of successful implementation that the Board observes the future. The year saw a warm welcome of a new Board, wherein a smooth transition was made to the incoming Board of Directors who have taken up the roles of advancing the strategic guidance and oversight roles with equal commitment and dedication. I am conﬁdent that with the support of all stakeholders by our side, the Bank will uphold its unique capabilities of delivering on key strategic objectives in the years ahead, and register higher ﬁnancial and operational results to the satisfaction of all stakeholders. Finally, on behalf of the Board of Directors and myself, I express my sincere gratitude to our esteemed customers for their continued business connections with us. I would also like to thank our shareholders for their support, to my fellow members of the Board of Directors, to the Executive Management and employees of BoA for their dedication and commitment, and to the National Bank of Ethiopia for its guidance and support. Annual Report 202324 Annual Report 202324 14 Annual Report 202324 16 Message of the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer HONORABLE SHAREHOLDERS, It is with great honor that I present to you the annual performance of the Bank of Abyssinia for the ﬁscal year ended June 30, 2024. Bank of Abyssinia has once again registered a positive growth in assets and proﬁt while passing through a myriad of challenges that the industry faced as a whole. The year has been one in which a subdued global economic activity was observed, a tough macroeconomic environment in the local econ- omy and the ﬁnancial industry facing a number of changes with a signiﬁcant impact on operations. Over the past year, the global economy, while still weak, showed signs of resilience and stabilizing in spite of persistent high interest rates, geopolitical tensions, and trade fragmentation. Global inﬂation has been slowing down, yet the ongoing war in Ukraine kept causing price instability worldwide. The domestic economy was facing challenges too, when it has been passing through impeding situa- tions such as continuing civil conﬂict, foreign exchange shortages, high inﬂation and global spillover effects. These situations have weakened economic activities, especially the productive sector, yet the countrys economy remained resilient and registered a positive growth. Bank of Abyssinia concluded the ﬁscal year 202324 operating amidst a number of challenges emanating from global as well as domestic fronts, and most importantly disruptions of the Banks business activi- ties affected by the armed conﬂicts in various parts of the country. Against the backdrop of such daunting conditions, Bank of Abyssinia achieved growth in assets and overall business. With unrelenting and focused efforts in effectively implementing business strategies, the Bank achieved an incremental total deposit growth of Birr 33.97 billion, while the total deposits reached at Birr 192.51 billion a 21.43 growth. The total outstanding loans and advances amount PI reached Birr 167.74 billion including Birr 4.91 billion of interest-free ﬁnance, showing a 14.49 increase over that of the preceding year. The interest-free ﬁnance alone showed a 59.51 growth over the preceding year showing the Banks ﬁrm commitment towards scaling up and meeting the ﬁnancing needs of BoAs IFB customers. Total asset of the Bank has increased to Birr 222.30 billion during the year from Birr 189.51 billion last year, i.e. an increase of Birr 32.79 billion representing a 17.30 increment, while the proﬁt before tax for the year reached Birr 5.28 billion. BoA continued strengthening its expansion effort in physical and digital footprint during the year such that its branch outlets reached 930. Moreover, the Banks virtual banking centers reached 35 as an additional 15 centers were launched during the reporting year. Annual Report 202324 17 Respected Shareholders, The Banks customer base in both traditional as well as in digital banking platform has attracted nearly 13.12 million deposit account holders, out of which Interest Free Banking accounts comprised more than 2.10 million customers. In the same way, the Banks digital banking user base increased, and at the end of the year there were 3.32 million card holders, 4.27 million mobile banking users, while the number of internet banking users reached more than ninety-three thousand. During the year, the Apollo Digital Bank services have gathered pace and the number of users, and the volume and value of transactions have been growing. In line with the strategic aim of strengthening its digital capability, the Bank continued investing resources in digital banking service expansion with a view to satisfy the ever changing customer needs and to explore the opportunities. To this end, a number of value-adding service features and digital solutions have been implemented. BoA has implemented a number of new initiatives aimed at introducing more value-addition in terms of convenience, quick service, and security to customers. During the year, BoA has upgraded its PCI DSS certiﬁcation to the latest version of PCI DSS v4.0 security controls for protecting cardhold- er account data and privacy. More value-added solutions introduced during the year include issuance of Digital Visa Card which enables customers to make card transactions using only their mobile apparatus. The Bank also introduced Instant Card Issuance services made available at ﬁve of the Banks ITMs virtual banking centers to enable customers obtain cards without the need for visiting branches. These efforts further strengthen customer account safety as well as ensure ease and convenience of digital banking services that will enhance customer satisfaction. The banking industry is poised to accommodate fast paced changes in the operating environment which we anticipate to observe both challenges as well as opportunities as the future unfolds. As the governments reform measures bring in a number of initiatives with implications to the Banks operations, we remain steadfast in fulﬁlling the new requirements, as well as explore ways of leveraging opportunities out of the anticipated positive results as the measures stimulate the economy. In line with the Banks aspirations of growth and sustainability, the Board has approved a new ﬁve-year strategy that strikes ground from July 2024 which is expected to consolidate the Banks business and leverage emerging and cutting-edge technologies as we go forward. The Banks ﬁrm stance on modernizing its service offerings by deploying latest technology solutions will continue to be a game changer in its favor. Further- more, BoA has long understood that delivery of conve- nient services deﬁnes customers preference and that it is instrumental for building strong relationship in this dynamic business environment. To this end efforts are geared towards ensuring that customers stay and grow with the Bank once they taste its services and user- friendly banking technology solutions. The Bank shall take advantage of its key resources of available banking technology infrastructure, compe- tent staff and the newly redesigned strategic frame- work which will redeﬁne and redirect our approach to effectively meet our customers expectations- and to position itself a step ahead of the competition. With the Board of Directors farsighted leadership, and the strong commitment and dedication from the exec- utive management and staff, I am conﬁdent that the Bank will exhibit another strong ﬁnancial performance and growth in the coming year. Finally, I would like to extend my gratitude to the Board of Directors for their guidance and foresight, and heartfelt thanks to our esteemed customers for their trust, and the Banks shareholders for their unwaver- ing support and patronage. I would like to thank also the Management Team and the entire staff for their commitment and dedication and the National Bank of Ethiopia for the assistance provided to us during the ﬁnancial year.

Going forward, the Bank shall implement a number of strategic initiatives which will support the Banks digital transformation and innovation, enhance resource mobilization and business growth, and increase its efficiency and effectiveness, which would ultimately secure the Banks growth and sustainable proﬁtability.

The Bank was established in 1996 in accordance with the Licensing Supervision of Banking Business Proclamation No. 841994 as amended by 5922008 and the Commercial Code of Ethiopia of 1960. The Bank opened branches throughout the Country. The Banks registered office is at The Bank is principally engaged in the provision of diverse range of ﬁnancial products and services to a wholesale, retail and SME clients base in Ethiopian Market. Assets held for sale measured at fair value less cost of disposal, and Deﬁned employee beneﬁt obligation measured at fair value Equity Investment at fair value through other comprehensive income are measured at fair value. The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these ﬁnancial statements are set out below These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. The ﬁnancial statements for the period ended 30 June 2024 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB. Additional information required by national regulations is included where appropriate. The ﬁnancial statements comprise the statement of proﬁt or loss and other comprehensive income, the statement of ﬁnancial position, the statement of changes in equity, the statement of cash ﬂows and the notes to the ﬁnancial statements. The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern principle under the historical cost concept, except for the following All values are rounded to the nearest thousand except when otherwise indicated. The ﬁnancial statements are presented in thousands of Ethiopian Birr Birr 000. The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Banks accounting policies. Changes in assumptions may have a signiﬁcant impact on the ﬁnancial statements in the period the assumptions changed. Management believes that the underlying assumptions are appropriate and that the Banks ﬁnancial statements therefore present the ﬁnancial position and results fairly. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are signiﬁcant to the ﬁnancial statements are disclosed in Note 4. 49 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. 1. GENERAL INFORMATION 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 2.1. INTRODUCTION TO SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 2.2. BASIS OF PREPARATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Legehar Building Gambia Street P.O Box 12947 Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Annual Report 202324 The Banks management made an assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern and is satisﬁed that it has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, management is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast signiﬁcant doubt upon the Banks ability to continue as a going concern, therefore, the ﬁnancial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis, the management have no doubt that the Bank will remain in existence after 12 months. The Bank present the statements of ﬁnancial position in the order of liquidity, ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are offset and the net amount are reported in the statements of ﬁnancial position of the Bank only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. Income and expenses are not offset in the income statements of the Bank unless required or permitted by an accounting standard or interpretation, and as speciﬁcally disclosed in the accounting policies of the Bank. The ﬁrst amendment clariﬁes how to classify debt and other liabilities as current or non-current. The objective of the amendment is aimed to promote consistency in applying the requirements by helping entities determine whether debt and other liabilities with an uncertain settlement date should be classiﬁed as current due or potentially due to be settled within one year or non-current. The amendment also includes clarifying the classiﬁcation requirements for debt an entity might settle by converting it into equity. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Bank's ﬁnancial statements. The second amendment to IAS 1 requires a company to classify debt as non-current only if the company can avoid settling the debt in the 12 months after the reporting date. However, a companys ability to do so is often subject to complying with covenants. For example, a company might have long-term debt that could become repayable within 12 months if the company fails to comply with covenants in that 12-month period. The amendments specify that covenants to be complied with after the reporting date do not affect the classiﬁcation of debt as current or non-current at the reporting date. Instead, the amendments require a company to disclose information about these covenants in the notes to the ﬁnancial statements and the aim of the amendments therefore is to improve the information companies provide about long-term debt with covenants. A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 July 2023 and earlier applications are permitted which have not been applied in preparing the ﬁnancial statements 50 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. i.

The amendments add to requirements explaining how a company accounts for a sale and leaseback after the date of the transaction. IFRS 16 had not previously speciﬁed how to measure the transaction when reporting after that date. The amendments add to the sale and leaseback requirements in IFRS 16, thereby supporting the consistent application of the standard. These amendments will not change the accounting for leases other than those arising in a sale and leaseback transaction. The amendments will be applied retrospectively and are not expected to have a material impact on the Banks ﬁnancial statements. The amendments introduce new disclosures to clarify the characteristics of supplier ﬁnance arrangements and require additional disclosure of such arrangements. The disclosure requirements in the amendments are intended to assist users of ﬁnancial statements in understanding the effects of supplier ﬁnance arrangements on an entitys liabilities, cash ﬂows and exposure to liquidity risk. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Banks ﬁnancial statements. The amendment to IAS 21 speciﬁes how an entity should assess whether a currency is exchangeable and how it should determine a spot exchange rate when exchangeability is lacking. A currency is considered to be exchangeable into another currency when an entity is able to obtain the other currency within a time frame that allows for a normal administrative delay and through a market or exchange mechanism in which an exchange transaction would create enforceable rights and obligations. IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information sets out the general requirements for a company to disclose information about its sustainability-related risks and opportunities that is useful to users of general-purpose ﬁnancial reports referred to as investors throughout this document in making decisions relating to providing resources to the company. the amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Banks ﬁnancial statements. IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures sets out the requirements for a company to disclose information about its climate-related risks and opportunities, while building on the requirements described in IFRS S1.

LACK OF EXCHANGEABILITY AMENDMENTS TO IAS 21, EFFECTIVE DATE IS 01 JANUARY 2025 A ﬁnancial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a ﬁnancial asset of one entity and a ﬁnancial liability or equity instrument of another entity. All ﬁnancial assets are initially recognized on the trade date, i.e. the date that the Bank become a party to the contractual provisions of instrument. 2.4.1. FINANCIAL ASSETS 2.4.1.1 DATE OF RECOGNITION a. FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY Items included in the ﬁnancial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Bank operatesthe functional currency. The functional currency and presentation currency of the Bank is the Ethiopian Birr. Foreign currency transactions are translated into Birr using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary items denominated in foreign currency are translated using the closing rate as at the reporting date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation of year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognized in the income statement. At the end of a reporting period non-monetary items carried at historical amounts continue to be measured using transaction-date exchange rates, monetary items are retranslated using the closing rate and non-monetary items carried at fair value are measured at valuation-date exchange rates. 52 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Annual Report 202324 2.3. FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY TRANSALATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY 2.4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS If a currency is not exchangeable into another currency, an entity is required to estimate the spot exchange rate at the measurement date. an entitys objective in estimating the spot exchange rate is to reﬂect the rate at which an orderly exchange transaction would take place at the measurement date between market participants under prevailing economic conditions. The amendments note that an entity can use an observable exchange rate without adjustment or another estimation technique. The amendments will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025. Early adoption is permitted, but will need to be disclosed. The bank is not early adopted. The objective of this standard is to set out requirements for the presentation and disclosure of information in general purpose ﬁnancial statements ﬁnancial statements to help ensure they provide relevant information that faithfully represents an entitys assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. It applies to all ﬁnancial statements that are prepared and presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs. Standards for recognizing, measuring, and disclosing speciﬁc transactions are addressed in other Standards and Interpretations. PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IFRS 18 EFFECTIVE DATE 1 JAN -2027 KEY REQUIREMENTS b. TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES How the performance of the portfolio and the ﬁnancial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the key management personnel The risks that affect the performance of the business model and the ﬁnancial assets held within that business model and, in particular, the way those risks are managed How managers of the business are compensated for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash ﬂows collected and The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Banks assessment. Solely payments of principal and interestproﬁt SPPI test upon determination of business model, the Bank will assess the contractual terms of ﬁnancial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. Principal for the purpose of this test is deﬁned as the fair value of the ﬁnancial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the ﬁnancial asset for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortization of the premiumdiscount. The most signiﬁcant elements of interestproﬁt within a lending arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. The Bank apply judgment and consider relevant factors such as the currency in which the ﬁnancial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interestproﬁt rate is set in assessing the SPPI. Purchases or sales of ﬁnancial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place regular way trades are recognized on the settlement date, i.e., the date that the Bank receives the asset on purchase or delivers the asset on sale. For purposes of subsequent measurement, ﬁnancial assets are classiﬁed in four categories Financial assets at amortized cost debt instruments Financial assets at fair value through OCI with recycling of cumulative gains and Losses debt instruments Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition equity instruments Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss. 2.4.1.3. SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT THE BANK ASSESS THE BUSINESS MODEL ON AN INSTRUMENT-BY-INSTRUMENT BASIS, AND IS BASED ON OBSERVABLE FACTORS SUCH AS 53 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Annual Report 202324 Financial assets are classiﬁed, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income OCI, and fair value through proﬁt or loss. The classiﬁcation of ﬁnancial assets at initial recognition depends on the ﬁnancial assets contractual cash ﬂow characteristics and the Banks business model for managing them. The Bank initially measures a ﬁnancial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a ﬁnancial asset not at fair value through proﬁt or loss, transaction costs. In order for a ﬁnancial asset to be classiﬁed and measured at amortized cost or debt instruments at fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash ﬂows that are solely payments of principal and interest SPPI on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level. The Banks business model for managing ﬁnancial assets refers to how it manages its ﬁnancial assets in order to generate cash ﬂows. The business model determines whether cash ﬂows will result from collecting contractual cash ﬂows, selling the ﬁnancial assets, or both. 2.4.1.2. INITIAL RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 54 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Annual Report 202324 This category is the most relevant to the Bank. The Bank measures ﬁnancial assets at amortized cost if both of the following conditions are met The ﬁnancial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold ﬁnancial assets in order to collect contractual cash ﬂows and the contractual terms of the ﬁnancial asset give rise on speciﬁed dates to cash ﬂows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest EIR method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognized in proﬁt or loss when the asset is de-recognized, modiﬁed or impaired. The Bank measures debt instruments at fair value through OCI if both of the following conditions are met The ﬁnancial asset is held within a business model with the objective of both holding to collect contractual cash ﬂows and selling and the contractual terms of the ﬁnancial asset give rise on speciﬁed dates to cash ﬂows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. For debt instruments at fair value through OCI, interest income, foreign exchange revaluation and impairment losses or reversals are recognized in proﬁt or loss and computed in the same manner as for ﬁnancial assets measured at amortized cost. The remaining fair value changes are recognized in OCI. Upon de-recognition, the cumulative fair value change recognized in OCI is recycled to proﬁt or loss. Upon initial recognition, the Bank can elect to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI when they meet the deﬁnition of equity under IAS 32 Financial Instruments Presentation and are not held for trading. The classiﬁcation is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Gains and losses on these ﬁnancial assets are never recycled to proﬁt or loss. Dividends are recognized as other income in proﬁt or loss when the right of payment has been established, except when the Bank beneﬁts from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the ﬁnancial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment assessment. The Bank elected to classify irrevocably its non-listed equity investments under this category as it intends to hold these investments for the foreseeable future. Included in ﬁnancial assets at FVTPL are ﬁnancial investments, ﬁnancial assets designated upon initial recognition, subsequent to initial recognition, ﬁnancial assets designated at FVTPL are recorded in the statement of ﬁnancial position at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized in the income statements. The designation eliminates or signiﬁcantly reduces inconsistent treatment that would otherwise arise from measuring the assets or liabilities or recognizing gains or losses on them on a different basis or The assets and liabilities are part of ﬁnancial assets, ﬁnancial liabilities or both, which are managed and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy. I FINANCIAL ASSETS AT AMORTIZED COST DEBT INSTRUMENTS II FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH OCI DEBT INSTRUMENTS III FINANCIAL ASSETS DESIGNATED AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH OCI EQUITY INSTRUMENTS IV FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss include ﬁnancial assets held for trading, ﬁnancial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through proﬁt or loss, or ﬁnancial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value. Financial assets are classiﬁed as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classiﬁed as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial assets with cash ﬂows that are not solely payments of principal and interest are classiﬁed and measured at fair value through proﬁt or loss, irrespective of the business model. Notwithstanding the criteria for debt instruments to be classiﬁed at amortized cost or at fair value through OCI, as described above, debt instruments may be designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss on initial recognition if doing so eliminates, or signiﬁcantly reduces, an accounting mismatch. Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss are carried in the statement of ﬁnancial position at fair value with net changes in fair value recognized in proﬁt or loss. The Bank recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses ECL for ﬁnancial assets that are debt instruments and are not measured at FVTPL. The Bank measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL except for the following for which they are measured as 12-month ECL Fixed income securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date And other ﬁnancial instruments for which credit risk has not increased signiﬁcantly since initial recognition. Financial liabilities are classiﬁed, at initial recognition, as ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All ﬁnancial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. The measurement of ﬁnancial liabilities depends on their classiﬁcation, as described below Financial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss include ﬁnancial liabilities held for trading and ﬁnancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through proﬁt or loss. Financial liabilities are classiﬁed as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in proﬁt or loss. Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through proﬁt or loss are designated at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in IFRS 9 are satisﬁed. The Bank has not designated any ﬁnancial liability as at fair value through proﬁt or loss. 55 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C.

INITIAL RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 2.4.2.2. SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT i ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss Annual Report 202324 2.4.3. IMPAIRMENT This is the category most relevant to the Bank. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognized in proﬁt or loss when the liabilities are de-recognized as well as through the EIR amortization process. Amortized cost is calculated by considering any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included as ﬁnance costs in proﬁt or loss. Where the terms of a ﬁnancial asset are renegotiated or modiﬁed or an existing ﬁnancial asset is replaced with a new one due to ﬁnancial difficulties of the borrower, then the Bank shall assess whether the ﬁnancial asset should be derecognized and ECL are measured as follows If the expected restructuring will not result in de-recognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash ﬂows arising from the modiﬁed ﬁnancial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset. If the expected restructuring will result in de-recognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is related as the ﬁnal cash ﬂow from the existing ﬁnancial asset at the time of its de-recognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing ﬁnancial asset that are discounted from the expected date of de-recognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing ﬁnancial asset. At each reporting date, the Bank shall assess whether ﬁnancial assets carried at amortized cost, debt ﬁnancial assets carried at FVOCI, and ﬁnance lease receivables are credit-impaired referred to as Stage 3 ﬁnancial assets. A ﬁnancial asset shall be considered credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash ﬂows of the ﬁnancial asset have occurred. Evidence that a ﬁnancial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data Signiﬁcant ﬁnancial difficulty of the borrower or issuer A breach of contract such as a default or past due event The restructuring of a loan or advance by the Bank of terms that the Bank would not consider otherwise It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other ﬁnancial reorganization or The disappearance of an active market for a security because of ﬁnancial difficulties. A loan that has been renegotiated due to deterioration in the borrowers condition shall be considered to be credit- impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash ﬂows has reduced signiﬁcantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more shall be considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory deﬁnition of default is different. ii Loans and Borrowings i Restructured ﬁnancial Assets ii Credit-impaired ﬁnancial assets 56 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Annual Report 202324 Loss allowance for ECL shall be presented in the statement of ﬁnancial position as follows For ﬁnancial assets measured at amortized cost as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets For loan commitments and ﬁnancial guarantee contracts generally, as a provision Where a ﬁnancial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Bank cannot identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from those on the drawn component the Bank presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The combined amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision and For debt instruments measured at FVOCI no loss allowance is recognized in the statement of ﬁnancial position because the carrying amount of those assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance shall be disclosed and is recognized in the fair value reserve Loans and debt securities shall be written off either partially or in full when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the amount in its entirety or a portion there of. This is generally the case when the Bank determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash ﬂows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment shall be carried out at the individual asset level. Recoveries of amounts previously written off shall be included in impairment losses on ﬁnancial instruments in the statement of proﬁt or loss and OCI. The Banks shall assess whether a ﬁnancial guarantee contact held is an integral element of a ﬁnancial asset that is accounted for as a component of that instrument or is a contract that is accounted for, separately. Where the Bank determines that the guarantee is an integral element of the ﬁnancial asset, then any premium payable in connection with the initial recognition of the ﬁnancial asset shall be treated as a transaction cost of acquiring it. The Bank shall consider the effect of the protection when measuring the fair value of the debit instrument and when measuring ECL. Where the Bank determines that the guarantee is not an integral element of the debt instrument, then it shall recognize an asset representing any prepayment of guarantee premium and a right to compensation for credit losses. iii Presentation of allowance for ECL in the statement of ﬁnancial position iv Write-off v Non-integral ﬁnancial guarantee contracts 57 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Annual Report 202324 The Bank shall derecognize at ﬁnancial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. If the terms of a ﬁnancial asset are modiﬁed, then the Bank shall evaluate whether the cash ﬂows of the modiﬁed asset are substantially different. If the cash ﬂows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash ﬂows from the original ﬁnancial asset shall be deemed to have expired. In this case, the original ﬁnancial asset shall be derecognized and a new ﬁnancial asset shall be recognized at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modiﬁcation shall be accounted for as follows Fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs shall be included in the initial measurement of the asset and Other fees are included in proﬁt or loss as part of the gain or loss on de-recognition. If cash ﬂows are modiﬁed when the borrower is in ﬁnancial difficulties, then the objective of the modiﬁcation is usually to maximize recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the Bank plans to modify a ﬁnancial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash ﬂows, then it shall ﬁrst consider whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modiﬁcation takes place. Where the modiﬁcation of a ﬁnancial asset measured at amortized cost or FVOCI does not result in de-recognition of the ﬁnancial asset, then the Bank shall ﬁrst recalculate the gross carrying amount of the ﬁnancial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognizes the resulting adjustment as a modiﬁcation gain or loss in proﬁt or loss. Any costs or fees incurred and fees received as part of the modiﬁcation adjust the gross carrying amount of the modiﬁed ﬁnancial asset and shall be amortized over the remaining term of the modiﬁed ﬁnancial asset. Where such a modiﬁcation is carried out because of ﬁnancial difficulties of borrower, then the gain or loss shall be presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it shall be presented as interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method. The Bank shall derecognize a ﬁnancial liability when its terms are modiﬁed and the cash ﬂows of the modiﬁed liability are substantially different. In this case, a new ﬁnancial liability. Based on the modiﬁed terms shall be recognized at fair value. I FINANCIAL ASSETS II FINANCIAL LIABILITIES I. FINANCIAL ASSETS II. FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 2.4.4. DE-RECOGNITION 2.4.5.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Annual Report 202324 i Financial Assets The difference between the carrying amount of the ﬁnancial liability derecognized and consideration paid is recognized in proﬁt or loss. Consideration paid shall include non-ﬁnancial assets transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modiﬁed ﬁnancial liability Where the modiﬁcation of a ﬁnancial liability is not accounted for as de-recognition, then the amortized cost of the liability shall be recalculated by discounting the modiﬁed cash ﬂows at the original effective interest rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognized in proﬁt or loss. Any costs and fees incurred are recognized as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortized over the remaining term of the modiﬁed ﬁnancial liability by re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities shall be offset and the net amount presented in the statement of ﬁnancial position when, and only when, the Bank currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Income and expenses shall be presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS, or for gains and losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Banks trading activity. At initial recognition, the Bank may designate certain ﬁnancial assets as at FVTPL because this designation eliminates or signiﬁcantly reduces an accounting mismatch, which would otherwise arise. ii Financial Liabilities The Bank shall designate certain ﬁnancial liabilities as at FVTPL in either of the following circumstances The liabilities are managed, evaluated and reported internally on a fair value basis or The designation eliminates or signiﬁcantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. Cash and cash equivalents include notes and coins on hand, unrestricted and restricted reserve requirement balances held with NBE and highly liquid ﬁnancial assets with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are subject to an insigniﬁcant risk of changes in their fair value, and are used by the Bank in the management of its short-term commitments.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Annual Report 202324 The amount capitalized at initial recognition is the purchase price of the asset along with any further costs incurred in bringing the asset to its present condition and location. Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount of recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic beneﬁts associated with the item will ﬂow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment if the recognition criteria are met. When signiﬁcant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Bank recognizes such parts as individual assets with speciﬁc useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized in income statement as incurred. I INITIAL RECOGNITION II SUBSEQUENT VALUATION 60 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Annual Report 202324 2.6. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follow. The Bank commences depreciation when the asset is available for use. Land is not depreciated. Capital work-in-progress is not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use. They are disclosed when reclassiﬁed during the year.

Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is included in income statement when the asset is derecognized. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each ﬁnancial year end and adjusted prospectively. Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalized development costs, are not capitalized and the related expenditure is reﬂected in income statement in the period in which the expenditure is incurred. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either ﬁnite or indeﬁnite. Intangible assets with ﬁnite live are amortized over the useful economic life. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a ﬁnite useful life are reviewed at least at each ﬁnancial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life, or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic beneﬁts embodied in the asset, are accounted for by changing the amortization period or methodology, as appropriate, which are then treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expenses on intangible assets with ﬁnite lives is presented as separate line item in the income statement. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method to write down the cost of intangible assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives. Except for undisclosed useful life in the contract the Bank has used 6 years useful life for all intangible assets the rest will use as per contract, the residual rate will be zero percent for all intangible asset. 61 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Annual Report 202324 2.7. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, are classiﬁed as investment properties. Recognition of investment properties takes place only when it is probable that the future economic beneﬁts that are associated with the investment property will ﬂow to the Bank and the cost can be reliably measured. This is usually when all risks are transferred. Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. The Bank has opted to subsequently carry investment property at cost and disclose fair value. Fair value is based on comparative market prices, adjusted, if necessary, for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the speciﬁc asset. If this information is not available, the Bank uses alternative valuation methods, such as recent prices on less active markets or discounted cash ﬂow projections. Valuations are performed as of the reporting date by professional values who hold recognized and relevant professional qualiﬁcations and have recent experience in location and category of the investment property being valued. These valuations from the basis for the carrying amounts in the ﬁnancial statements. The fair value of investment property reﬂects, the near current market conditions. The fair value of investment property does not reﬂect future capital expenditure that will improve or enhance the property and does not reﬂect the related future beneﬁts from this future expenditure other than those a rational market participant would consider when determining the value of the property. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized to the assets carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic beneﬁts associated with the expenditure will ﬂow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. When part of an investment property is replaced, the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. Investment properties are derecognized when they have been disposed. Where the Bank disposes of a property at fair value in an arms length transaction, the carrying value immediately prior to the sale is adjusted to the transaction price, and the adjustment is recorded in the statement of changes in net assets available for beneﬁt. At an inception of a contract, the Bank assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identiﬁed asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identiﬁed assets, the Bank uses the deﬁnition of a lease in IFRS 16. This policy is applied to contracts entered into before, on or after 1 July 2019 that were previously identiﬁed as leases. 2.8. INVESTMENT PROPERTY 2.9. LEASE 62 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Annual Report 202324 BANK ACTING AS A LESSEE SHORT-TERM LEASES AND LEASES OF LOW-VALUE ASSETS 63 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 At commencement or on modiﬁcation of a contract that contains a lease component, the Bank allocates consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone price. However, for leases of branches and office premises the Bank has elected to separate non-lease components from the space rental payment obligations. The Bank recognizes a right-of-use of asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date, The right-of-use of asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove any improvements made to branches or office premises The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain re-measurement of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, and the banks incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Bank uses its incremental borrowing rate at the discount rate. The Bank determines its incremental borrowing rate by analyzing its borrowings from various external sources and makes certain adjustments to reﬂect the terms of the lease and type of asset leased. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is re-measured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Banks estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Bank changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase extension or termination option if there is a revised in-substance ﬁxed lease payment. When the lease liability is re-measured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in proﬁt or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. The Bank presents right-of-use assets in property and equipment and lease liabilities in other liabilities in the statement of ﬁnancial position. The Bank has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for lease of low value assets and short-term leases, including ATM rent payments. The Bank recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Fixed payments, including in-substance ﬁxed payments Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as the commencement date Amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and The exercise price under a purchase option that the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Bank is reasonably certain not to terminate early. Annual Report 202324 At inception or on modiﬁcation of a contract that contains a lease component, the Bank allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the bases of their relative stand-alone selling prices. When the Bank acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether the lease is a ﬁnance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Bank makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset, if this is the case, then the lease is a ﬁnance lease if not then it is an operating lease as part of this assessment, the Bank considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset. The Bank applies the de-recognition and impairment requirement in IFRS 9 to the net investment in the lease. The Bank further regularly reviews estimated unguaranteed residual values used in calculating the gross investment in the lease. Non-current assets or disposal groups are classiﬁed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and as safe is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee beneﬁts, ﬁnancial assets and investment property that are carried at fair value and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which are speciﬁcally exempted from this requirement. Non-current assets are classiﬁed as held for sale and measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell when An impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset or disposal group to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognized for any subsequent increases in fair value less cost to sell of an asset or disposal group. But not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognized. A gain or loss not previously recognized by the date of the sale of the non-current asset or disposal group is recognized at the date of de-recognition. Non-current assets including those that are part of a disposal group are not depreciated or amortized while they are classiﬁed as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classiﬁed as held for sale continue to be recognized. Non-current assets classiﬁed as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classiﬁed as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal group classiﬁed as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the balance sheet. BANK ACTING AS A LESSOR 2.10. NON-CURRENT ASSETS OR DISPOSAL GROUPS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERA- TIONSACQUIRED COLLATERAL 64 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Annual Report 202324 a. Their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through sale b. They are available for immediate sale in their present condition c. Their sale is highly probable. The Bank assesses, each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required. The Bank estimates the assets recoverable amount. An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or Cash-Generating Units CGU fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inﬂows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk speciﬁc to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are considered. If no such transactions can be identiﬁed, and appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. The Bank bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Banks CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of ﬁve years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash ﬂows after the ﬁfth year. For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognized impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Bank estimates the assets or CGUs recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognized in the income statement. Other assets are generally deﬁned as claims held against other entities for the future receipt of money. The assets in the Banks ﬁnancial statements include the following a Prepayment Prepayments are payment made in advance for services to be enjoyed in future. The amount is initially capitalized in the reporting period in which the payment is made and subsequently amortized over the period in which the service is to be enjoyed. b Other receivables Other receivables are recognized upon the occurrence of event or transaction as they arise and cancelled when payment is received. The Banks other receivables are rent receivables and other receivables from debtors. Acquired collateral held for sale presented under the held for sale account if meets the IFRS-5 requirement, but if the management decide for banks use recorded under PPE. A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classiﬁed as held for sale and that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single coordinated plant to dispose of such a line of business of area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view of resale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the statement of proﬁt or loss. 2.11. IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS 2.12 OTHER ASSETS 65 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Annual Report 202324 The Bank measures ﬁnancial instruments classiﬁed as FVTPL and FVOCI at fair value at each statement of ﬁnancial position date. Fair value related disclosures for ﬁnancial instruments and non-ﬁnancial assets that are measured at fair value or where fair values are disclosed are, summarized in the following notes Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Bank. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. The Bank uses valuation technique that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value measurement as a whole For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the ﬁnancial statements on a recurring basis. The Bank determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization based on the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period. The Banks management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement, such as available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Bank has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. 2.13.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS The Bank operates various post-employment schemes, including both deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution pension plans and post-employment beneﬁts. a. Deﬁned contribution plan The Bank operates two deﬁned contribution plans i. Pension scheme in line with the provisions of Ethiopian Pension of private organization employees proclamation 7152011. Funding under the scheme is 7 and 11 by employees and the Bank, respectively ii. Provident fund contribution, funding under this scheme is 6 and 12 by employees and the Bank, respectively based on the employees salary. Employers contribution to this scheme are charged to proﬁt or loss and other comprehensive income in the period in which they relate. The liability or asset recognized in the balance sheet in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans is the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The liability recognized in the statement of ﬁnancial position in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans if the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outﬂows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the beneﬁts will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. The current service cost of the deﬁned beneﬁt plan, recognized in the income statement in employee beneﬁt expense, except where included in the cost of an asset, reﬂects the increase in the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, beneﬁt changes curtailments and settlements. Past-service costs are recognized immediately income. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Termination beneﬁts are payable to Bank employees and executive directors when employment is terminated by the Bank before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these beneﬁts. The Bank recognizes termination beneﬁts when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or providing termination beneﬁts as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. c. Termination beneﬁts 67 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 The Bank recognizes a liability and an expense for bonuses and proﬁt-sharing based on a formula that takes into consideration the proﬁt attributable to the companys shareholders after certain adjustments. The Bank recognizes a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a construction obligation. d. Proﬁt-sharing and bonus plans Annual Report 202324 b. Deﬁned beneﬁt plan a. Current Income tax The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current periods taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in Ethiopia. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. 68 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C.

EARNINGS PER SHARE 2.19. INCOME TAXATION Provisions are recognized when the Bank has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, its probable that an outﬂow of resources embodying economic beneﬁts will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Bank expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in income statement net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reﬂects, when appropriate, the risks speciﬁc to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as other operating expenses. That require the Bank to make speciﬁed payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a speciﬁed party fails to meet its obligation when it is due in accordance with the contractual terms. In the ordinary course of business, the Bank give ﬁnancial guarantees, consisting of letters of credit, guarantees and acceptances. The Bank presents basic earnings per share for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the proﬁt or loss attributable to ordinary shareholder of the Bank by weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The Banks share capital represents the fully paid up capital contributed paid by shareholders for the value of subscribed shares. Dividends declared on ordinary shares are recognized as a liability in the period in which all relevant approvals have been obtained. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options or to the acquisition of a business are shown in equality as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds 69 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 c Income tax Current tax assetsrecoverable and current tax liabilitiesprovisions are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date Income taxes for the year comprises current and deferred taxes. Current tax expenses are determined according to the tax laws of each jurisdiction in which the Bank generate taxable income. Current tax expenses relating to items recognized directly in equity, are recognized in other comprehensive income or in equity and not in the income statements. d Deferred tax assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁt will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized except When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting proﬁt nor taxable proﬁt or loss and in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable proﬁt will be available against which the Temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realized or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁt will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when they arise in the same tax reporting group and where there is both the legal right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. b. Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the ﬁnancial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt nor loss.

RECOGNITION OF INCOME AND EXPENSES The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable proﬁt will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax assets to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable proﬁt will allow the deferred tax assets to be utilized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside income statements is recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Deferred tax arising from a business combination is adjusted against goodwill on acquisition. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic beneﬁts will ﬂow to the Bank and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, considering contractually deﬁned terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty. The Bank earns income from interest on loans given for domestic trade and services, building and construction, manufacturing, agriculture and personal loans. Other incomes include margins on letter of credits and performance guarantees. For all the government bills measured at amortized cost and interest-bearing ﬁnancial assets classiﬁed as available for-sale interest income or expense is recorded using the effective interest rate EIR, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the ﬁnancial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the ﬁnancial asset or ﬁnancial liability. The calculation considers all contractual terms of the ﬁnancial instruments for example, prepayment options and includes any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and are an integral part of the effective interest rate EIR, but not future credit losses. 2.20.2. NET TRADING INCOME 2.20.3. NET INTEREST INCOME 71 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Net trading income comprises gains less losses related to trading assets and liabilities, and includes all fair value changes, interest, dividends and foreign exchange differences. The carrying amount of the ﬁnancial asset or ﬁnancial liability is adjusted if the Bank revises its estimates of payments or receipts. The adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the original EIR and the change in carrying amount is recorded as Interest and similar income for ﬁnancial assets and interest and similar expenses for ﬁnancial liabilities. Once the recorded value of a ﬁnancial asset or a group of similar ﬁnancial assets has been reduced due to an impairment loss, interest income continues to be recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash ﬂows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss. The interest income has been calculated using the contractual interest rate since the loan processing fees have no material effect on the contractual interest rate. So, consider that the contractual interest rate and EIR are the same. a Effective interest rate and amortized cost Interest income and expense are recognized in proﬁt or loss using the contractual cash ﬂow. The gross carrying amount of the ﬁnancial asset or The amortized cost of the ﬁnancial liability. The calculation of contractual loans and advances interest rate does not include transaction costs and fees and payments paid or received. b Amortized cost and gross carrying amount The amortized cost of a ﬁnancial asset or ﬁnancial liability is the amount at which the ﬁnancial asset or ﬁnancial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method or any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for ﬁnancial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance or impairment, allowance before 1 July, 2018. The gross carrying amount of a ﬁnancial asset is the amortized cost of a ﬁnancial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance. c Calculation of interest income and expense In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset when the asset is not credit-impaired or to the amortized cost of the liability. However, for ﬁnancial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the ﬁnancial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts the gross basis. For ﬁnancial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the asset. The calculation of interest income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves. Annual Report 202324 In measuring the amortized cost, the Bank applied the contractual interest rate since additional transaction costs, fees have no material impact, and there is no material difference when we compare EIR calculation. d Presentation Interest income and expense presented in the statement of proﬁt or loss and OCI include Interest income and expense on all trading assets and liabilities are considered to be incidental to the Banks trading operations and are presented together with all other changes in the fair value of trading assets and liabilities in net trading income. Interest income and expense on other ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities at FVTPL are presented in net income from other ﬁnancial instruments at FVTPL. In measuring the amortized cost, the Bank applied the contractual interest rate since additional transaction costs, fees have no material impact, and there is no material difference when we compare EIR calculation. Fees and commission income and expenses that are integral to the effective interest rate on a ﬁnancial asset government bills or liability are included in the measurement of the effective interest rate. Other fees and commission income money transfer, letter of credit, payment orders, un cleared effects, ATM and POS transactions etc. are recognized as the related services are performed. When a loan commitment is not expected to result in the draw-down of a loan, loan commitment fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the commitment period. Other fees and commission expense relate mainly to transaction and service fees are expensed as the services are received. In accordance IFRS 15 core principle that BoA recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reﬂects the consideration to which, BoA expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. 72 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Annual Report 202324 The preparation of ﬁnancial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of income, expenses, assets, liabilities, the accompanying disclosures and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although these estimates and judgments are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may differ. The most signiﬁcant uses of judgments and estimates are as follows The Banks management have assessed its ability to continue as a going concern and is satisﬁed that it has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, management is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast signiﬁcant doubt upon the Banks ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the ﬁnancial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis. The measurement of the ECL for ﬁnancial assets measured at amortized cost and FVOCI is an area that requires the use of complex models and signiﬁcant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behavior. 74 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C.

EVEBITDA works better in case of service companies and where the gestation is too long and net debt can be high. For example, capital intensive sectors like telecom and sunrise sectors like Fintech, E-commerce can better use of EVEBITDA as a measure of valuation. EVEBITDA can also be a better measure where the leverage and net proﬁts are more vulnerable to business cycles and ﬁnancial solvency. PBV ratio works well in the case of manufacturing companies and where the business model is matured. PBV calculates the stock price as a ratio of the book value of the stock net worth.

The ﬁnancial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold ﬁnancial assets in order to collect contractual cash ﬂows and b. The contractual terms of the ﬁnancial asset give rise on speciﬁed dates to cash ﬂows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. A ﬁnancial asset shall be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both of the following conditions are met a. The ﬁnancial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash ﬂows and selling ﬁnancial assets and b. The contractual terms of the ﬁnancial asset give rise on speciﬁed dates to cash ﬂows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. As per IFRS 9 para 4.1.4, a ﬁnancial asset shall be measured at fair value through proﬁt or loss unless it is measured at amortized cost in accordance with paragraph 4.1.2 or at fair value through other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 4.1.2A. However, BoA may make an irrevocable election at initial recognition for particular investments in equity instruments that would otherwise be measured at fair value through proﬁt or loss to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income. IFRS 13 para 74 The availability of relevant inputs and their relative subjectivity might affect the selection of appropriate valuation techniques. However, the fair value hierarchy priorities the inputs to valuation techniques, not the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Para 81 Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a speciﬁed contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the following a. quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets. b. quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. c. inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, for example i. interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals ii. implied volatilities and iii. credit spreads. d. market-corroborated inputs. Annual Report 202324 The Bank shall consider a ﬁnancial asset to be in default when The borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank in full, without recourse by the Bank to actions such as realizing security if any is held or The borrower is more than 90 days past due on any material credit obligation to the Bank. This will be consistent with the rebuttable criteria set out by IFRS 9 and existing practice of the Bank or if it meets the National Bank of Ethiopia NBEs deﬁnition of default, if in the future the NBE prescribes the criteria of default for IFRS 9 purposes. In assessing whether a borrower is in default, the Bank shall consider indicators that are Qualitative senior management using professional judgment may resort to this approach guided by matters such as breaches of covenants which are deemed material, declaration of bankruptcy by the customer, death of borrower individual proprietorships with no succession plan, loss of a signiﬁcant portion of revenue stream or any other event signiﬁcantly impacting the ability of the customer to repay and other customer speciﬁc factors. This will be applied on a case by case basis and is not limited to the above factors Quantitative such as overdue status and non-payment of another obligation of the same issuer to the Bank and Based on data developed internally and obtained from external sources. Inputs into the assessment of whether a ﬁnancial instrument is in default and their signiﬁcance may vary over time to reﬂect changes in circumstances. In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, management has made judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively. The Bank will use judgment to determine the valuation approach and technique that is most appropriate to the Bank. This will be the approach that is Most appropriate in the circumstances For which sufficient data is available and Maximizes the use of observable inputs, and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. We involved the consideration of similar approaches the Bank has taken in the past, and of the approach that makes most use of external data and relies least on internal estimates.

This is as outlined in the steps below. Obtain historical periodic receivables ageing reports for 2 years. Flow rate represents the probability of a receivable moving into the next ageing bucket in the subsequent tracking period. Each ﬂow rate is assumed to be independent of the next. A loss rate is calculated for each bucket as a product of subsequent ﬂow rates. This represents the probability that the receivables in a given bucket will reach the 90 DPD. 79 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 The Bank consider current tax as the amount of income tax payable recoverable in respect of taxable proﬁt, recognize deferred tax for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences, unused tax losses carried forward and unused tax credits carried forward. Annual Report 202324 3.8 PROVISION ON GUARANTEE AND LETTER OF CREDIT 3.9 DEFERRED TAX ASSET AND LIABILITIES The cost of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension plan, long service awards, gratuity scheme and post-employment medical beneﬁts and the present value of these deﬁned beneﬁt obligations are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the pension increases. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. Description of any funding arrangements and funding policy that affect future contributions. The expected contributions to the plan for the next annual reporting period. Information about the maturity proﬁle of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation. This will include the weighted average duration of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation and may include other information about the distribution of the timing of beneﬁt payments, such as a maturity analysis of the beneﬁt payments. 3.10. DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS 3.10.1 DEFINED BENEFIT PLANSFUNDING ARRANGEMENTS AND FUNDING POLICY Guarantees will be assumed by management to have a CCF of 100. The on-balance sheet economic sector PDs and LGD have been assumed to be the off-balance sheet PD and LGD. The PD has been assumed to follow the Basel minimum PD and the LGD has been assumed to follow either the minimum Basel LGD or the unsecured LGD. For LCs, default occurs when a customer does not honor their obligation at the point of maturity. LCs with a 100 cash-backed margins will not be considered for impairment as the LGD is zero. Default for a letter of credit is deﬁned as any default experience that the Bank has after converting the LC into an on-balance sheet facility, i.e. 90DPD after the conversion date. These default rates will be estimated as the total defaulted LCs amounts as a proportion of the total LC portfolio as at a reporting date. In instances where there are no historical default rates for the LCs It is recommended that the Basel minimum PD of 5 basis points 0.05 is assigned. This is assumed because the credit risk of an LC is expected to be lower than that of an on-balance sheet facility. For ECL computation purposes, the following will be assumed by management when determining the LCs LGD For secured customers with on-balance sheet facilities, assign the on-balance sheet LGD. For unsecured customers without on-balance sheet facilities, assign the unsecured LGD computed for the respective economic sector. The exposure at default for the LC will be calculated as the committed amount less any cash margin in lien that has been used to cover the LC. The estimate of the useful lives of assets is based on Managements judgment. Any material adjustment to the estimated useful lives of items of property and equipment will have an impact on the carrying value of these items The Bank determine the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The fair value less costs of disposal calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions, conducted at arms length, for similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a DCF model. The cash ﬂows are derived from the budget for the next ﬁve years and do not include restructuring activities that the Bank is not yet committed to or signiﬁcant future investments that will enhance the assets performance of the CGU being tested. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash ﬂow model as well as the expected future cash-inﬂows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purpose. BoA recognize ROU assets at the commencement date of the lease i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use. ROU assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any re-measurement of lease liabilities. The cost of ROU assets includes the amount of lease liabilities adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. ROU assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life and the lease term. Lease liabilities at the commencement date of the lease, the Bank recognize lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. Interest expense on the lease liability is presented separately from depreciation of the right-of-use asset, as a component of ﬁnance costs. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets, the Bank apply the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less. 3.11 DEPRECATION AND CARRYING VALUE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 3.13.

Signiﬁcant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable proﬁts together with future tax planning strategies. The Bank capitalizes development costs for a project in accordance with the accounting policy. Initial capitalization of costs is based on Managements judgment that technological and economic feasibility is conﬁrmed, usually when a product development project has reached a deﬁned milestone according to established project management model. In determining the amounts to be capitalized, management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, discount rates to be applied and the expected period of beneﬁts Risk is the effect of uncertainty on objectives of an entity an effect can be either positive or negative deviation from what is expected. Therefore, risk is the chance that there will be a positive or negative deviation from the objective that is expected to be achieved. Risk management is a systematic approach to identify, analyses, evaluate, and treat risks that may have an adverse impact on targeted objectives of an entity and it is also a process of understanding and managing risks that the entity is inevitably subjected to in due process of achieving its corporate objectives. Risk management has evolved into an important driver for strategic decisions in support of business strategies while balancing the appropriate levels of risk taken to the desired levels of returns. Financial risk management overview Risk management has evolved into an important driver for strategic decisions in support of business strategies while balancing the appropriate levels of risk taken to the desired levels of returns. The Board of Directors is the ultimate governing body, which has overall responsibility for establishing a sound risk management and internal control system, as well as for reviewing its adequacy and effectiveness in identifying, assessing and responding to risks that may hinder the Bank from achieving its objectives. The Management at executive levels has assist and support the Board committees in overseeing core areas of business operations and controls, Governance and Risk Oversight There is a clear, effective and robust governance structure with well-deﬁned, transparent and consistent lines of responsibility. Risk Management Practices and Processes BoA risk management processes are in place to actively identify, measure, control, monitor and report risks inherent in all products and activities undertaken by the Bank. Stress Test Stress testing is used to test the resilience of the Banks exposure against future ﬁnancial scenarios and gauge the resulting various risks and adequacy of capital. 3.15. DEVELOPMENT COST 4.1. INTRODUCTION 4. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 81 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Annual Report 202324 The Board of Directors shall generally be responsible for ensuring the appropriateness of the Banks risk management program and its proper implementation. The Board has already established Loan Review and Risk Management Subcommittee that facilitates Board function. In view of the strategic direction and risk appetite by the Board, the senior Management shall be responsible for the implementation of risk management policies and procedures. Business unitsoperational units are primarily responsible for ensuring the Banks compliance with regulatory requirement and internal policies and procedures. Bank of Abyssinia considers Liquidity, Credit, Market, Operational, Legal, Strategic, Compliance, and Reputational risks as core risks of the Bank. Treasury and Financial Accounting Department establishes management information system that promptly conveys information between the organs in the liquidity risk management structure. ALCO shall closely control asset and liability structure of the Bank for maximization of its earning without endangering its liquidity status and report the status periodically for the board of directors. The Banks risks are measured using a method that reﬂect both the expected loss likely to arise in normal circumstances and unexpected losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss based on scenario analysis. The analysis makes used probabilities derived from historical experience, adjusted to reﬂect the economic environment. The Bank also runs worst-case scenarios that would arise in the event that extreme events which are unlikely to occur do, in fact occur. Monitoring and reviewing of risk management practice should be planned part of the risk management process and involve regular checking to ensure that adequate and important Information is generated by the risk management process. Furthermore, the information shall be captured, used and maintained effectively. This ensures that risk management is Effective, and provides evidence of a demonstrable risk management system. Thus, its important to have a documented formal record of the risk management process outcomes, Risk review report will be generated periodically, which is outcome of monitoring and review of risk management practice of the Bank. The report will propose plausible solution for identiﬁed loopholes besides describing the current status of risk management practice. The targeted audience are Board of Directors and executive management. Risk controls and mitigates, identiﬁed and approved for the Bank, are documented for existing and new processes and systems. The adequacy of this mitigates is tested on a periodic basis through administration of control self- assessment questionnaires, using an operational risk management tool which requires risk owners to conﬁrm the effectiveness of established controls. These are subsequently audited as part of the review process. 4.1.1. RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE 4.1.2. RISK MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING SYSTEMS 4.1.3. RISK MITIGATION 82 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Annual Report 202324 The Banks ﬁnancial assets are classiﬁed in to the following measurement categories measured at amortized cost and fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI. Financial instruments are classiﬁed in the statement of ﬁnancial position in accordance with their legal form and substance. Credit risk is the risk that the Bank borrowers are either unwilling to discharge their obligation or their ability to discharge such obligation is impaired resulting in economic loss to the Bank. Credit Risk also arise from off-balance commitments such as guarantees letter of credits and placement with other banks both domestic and foreign banks. The Bank shall strive to ensure the existence of fundamental credit risk management elements that enable to effectively manage the credit risk exposure. Sound and prudent risk management involves the minimization of concentration risk by diversifying Credit portfolio therefore, the Bank shall have credit diversiﬁcation policies state clearly the goals for Portfolio mix and place exposure limits on single counterparties and groups of associated counterparties, key industries or economic sectors, geographical regions and new and existing products, Collateral type, NPLs and off-balance sheet exposure. Moreover, the Bank shall strictly observe the directives, rules and regulations of the NBE in this respect. The National Bank of Ethiopia NBE sets credit risk limit for a single borrower, one related party and all related parties to not exceed 25, 15 and 35 of Banks total capital amount as of the reporting quarterly period respectively. 83 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C.

The exposures to credit risk are unilateral and only the lending bank faces the risk of loss. Credit risk assessed jointly by business and credit units where each counterparty is assigned a credit rating based on the assessment of relevant qualitative and quantitative factors, including the counterpartys ﬁnancial position, future cash ﬂows, types of facilities and collateral offered. In determining whether the credit risk that is risk of default on a ﬁnancial instrument has increased signiﬁcantly since initial recognition, the Bank shall consider reasonable and supportable Information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort, including both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on the Banks historical experience, expert credit assessment and forward-looking information. Credit risk measurement The Bank shall consider a ﬁnancial asset to be in default when The borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank in full, without recourse by the Bank to actions such as realizing security if any is held or The borrower is more than 90 days past due on any material credit obligation to the Bank. This will be consistent with the rebuttable criteria set out by IFRS 9 and existing practice of the Bank or if it meets the National Bank of Ethiopia NBEs deﬁnition of default, if in the future the NBE prescribes the criteria of default for IFRS 9 purposes. In assessing whether a borrower is in default, the Bank shall consider indicators that are qualitative senior management using professional judgment may resort to this approach guided by matters such as breaches of covenants which are deemed material, declaration of bankruptcy by the customer, death of borrower individual proprietorships with no succession plan, loss of a signiﬁcant portion of revenue stream or any other event signiﬁcantly impacting the ability of the customer to repay and other customer speciﬁc factors. This will be applied on a case-by-case basis and is not limited to the above factors Quantitative such as overdue status and non-payment of another obligation of the same issuer to the Bank and Based on data developed internally and obtained from external sources. Inputs into the assessment of whether a ﬁnancial instrument is in default and their signiﬁcance may vary over time to reﬂect changes in circumstances. 84 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C.

The management view and judgment shall include, but not limited to, the following assessments Classiﬁcation of exposures by any other Banks and Financial institutions or local Credit Reference Bureau CRB. Unavailable inadequate ﬁnancial informationﬁnancial statements Qualiﬁed report by external auditors Signiﬁcant contingent liabilities Loss of key staff to the organization Increase in operational risk and higher occurrence of fraudulent activities Continued delay and non-cooperation by the borrower in providing key relevant documentation Deterioration in credit worthiness due to factors other than those listed above.

BOA shall identify a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk where Exposures have a regulatory risk rating of special mention an exposure is greater than 30 days past due this is in line with the IFRS 9 30 DPD rebuttable presumption An exposure has been restructured in the past due to credit risk related factors or which was non-performing and is now regular subject to the regulatory cooling off period or By comparing an exposures credit risk quality at the date of reporting with the credit risk quality on initial recognition of the exposure. The assessment of signiﬁcant deterioration is key in establishing the requirement to measure an allowance based on 12-month expected credit losses and one that is based on lifetime expected credit losses. Determining whether credit risk has increased signiﬁcantly BoA shall establish a framework that incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information to determine whether the credit risk on a particular ﬁnancial instrument has increased signiﬁcantly since initial recognition. The framework should align with the Banks internal credit risk The criteria for determining whether credit risk has increased signiﬁcantly will vary by portfolio and will include a backstop based on delinquency 30 DPD presumption. Quantitative factors BoA Bank shall deem the credit risk of a particular exposure to have increased signiﬁcantly since initial recognition based on a loan being in arrears for a period of 31 to 90 days in accordance with IFRS 9 paragraph 5.5.11. The Bank shall develop an internal rating model going forward and movement in rating grades between the reporting period and the initial recognition date date of initial application of IFRS 9 of the loan will form the basis of signiﬁcant increases in credit risk.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Annual Report 202324 As a backstop, and as required by IFRS 9, the Bank shall presumptively consider that a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when an asset is more than 30 days past due. The Bank shall determine days past due by counting the number of days since the earliest elapsed due date in respect of which full payment has not been received The following analysis represents the Banks maximum exposure to credit risk of on-balance sheet ﬁnancial assets and off-balance sheet exposure, excluding any collateral held or other credit enhancements. For on-balance sheet ﬁnancial assets, the exposure to credit risk equals their carrying amount. For off-balance sheet exposure, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount that the Bank would have to pay if the obligations of the instruments issued are called upon andor the full amount of the undrawn credit facilities granted to customersborrowers. 30 June 2023 Birr'000 Credit exposure for on-balance sheet ﬁnancial assets Cash and cash equivalents Loans and advances to customers Debt securities at amortized cost Other Financial Assets 30 June 2024 Birr'000 27,943,909 163,922,581 10,821,281 8,140,862 210,828,634 21,148,143 143,796,167 8,475,363 6,596,667 180,016,341 Credit exposure for off-balance sheet items Letter of Credit Loans Commitments Letter of Guarantee Total maximum credit risk exposure 2,571,134 8,276,868 10,531,742 21,379,745 232,208,379 983,323 5,500,000 3,861,742 10,345,065 190,361,406 Maximum exposure 4.3.3 CREDIT QUALITY ANALYSIS CONTINUED 87 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C.

However, collateral provides additional security and the Bank generally requests that corporate borrowers provide it. The Bank may take collateral in the form of a ﬁrst charge over real estate, ﬂoating charges over all corporate assets and other liens and guarantees. Because of the Banks focus on corporate customers creditworthiness, the Bank does not routinely update the valuation of collateral held against all loans to corporate customers. Valuation of collateral is updated when the loan is put on a watch list and the loan is monitored more closely. For credit-impaired loans, the Bank obtains appraisals of collateral because it provides input into determining the management credit risk actions. VI.

Investment securities designated as at FVTPL 91 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 b. Overdraft exposures The Bank allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on a variety of data that is determined to be predictive of the risk of default and applying experienced credit judgment. Credit risk grades are deﬁned using qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of risk of default. These factors vary depending on the nature of the exposure and the type of borrower. Credit risk grades are deﬁned and calibrated such that the risk of default occurring increases exponentially as the credit risk deteriorates so, for example, the difference in risk of default between credit risk grades 1 and 2 is smaller than the difference between credit risk grades 2 and 3. Each exposure is allocated to a credit risk grade on initial recognition based on available information about the borrower. Exposures are subject to ongoing monitoring, which may result in an exposure being moved to a different credit risk grade. The monitoring typically involves use of the following data The objective of the assessment is to identify whether a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk has occurred for an exposure by comparing The remaining lifetime probability of default PD as at the reporting date with The remaining lifetime PD for this point in time that was estimated at the time of initial recognition of the exposure adjusted where relevant for changes in prepayment expectations. The Bank uses three criteria for determining whether there has been a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk Quantitative test based on movement in PD Qualitative indicators and A backstop of 30 days past due, a. Term loan exposures Payment record this includes overdue status as well as a range of variables about payment ratios Utilisation of the granted limit Requests for and granting of forbearance Existing and forecast changes in business, ﬁnancial and economic conditions. Information obtained during periodic review of customer ﬁles e.g. audited ﬁnancial statements, management accounts, budgets and projections. Examples of areas of particular focus are gross proﬁt margins, ﬁnancial leverage ratios, debt service coverage, and compliance Data from credit reference agencies, press articles, changes in external credit ratings Actual and expected signiﬁcant changes in the political, regulatory and technological environment of the borrower or in its business activities Internally collected data on customer behavior e.g. utilization of credit card facilities Affordability metrics Annual Report 202324 iii. Credit risk grades The Bank assesses whether credit risk has increased signiﬁcantly since initial recognition at each reporting date. Determining whether an increase in credit risk is signiﬁcant depends on the characteristics of the ﬁnan- cial instrument and the borrower. What isconsidered signiﬁcant differs for different types of lending. The credit risk may also be deemed to have increased signiﬁcantly since initial recognition based on qualita- tive factors linked to the Banks credit risk management processes that may not otherwise be fully reﬂected in its quantitative analysis on a timely basis. This will be the case for exposures that meet certain heightened risk criteria, such as placement on a watch list. Such qualitative factors are based on its expert judgment and relevant historical experiences. As a backstop, the Bank considers that a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when an asset ismore than 30 days past due. Days past due are determined by counting the number of days since the earli- est elapsed due date in respect of which full payment has not been received. Due dates are determined with- out considering any grace period that might be available to the borrower. If there is evidence that there is no longer a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk relative to initial recognition, then the loss allowance on an instrument returns to being measured as 12-month ECL. Some qualitative indicators of an increase in credit risk, such as delinquency or forbearance, may be indicative of an increased risk of default that persists after the indicator itself has ceased to exist. In these cases, the Bank determines a probation period during which the ﬁnancial asset is required to demonstrate good behaviour to provide evidence that its credit risk has declined sufficiently. When contractual terms of a loan have been modiﬁed, evidence that the criteria for recognising lifetime ECL are no longer met includes a history of up-to-date payment performance against the modiﬁed contractual terms. iv. Generating the term structure of PD v. Determining whether credit risk has increased signiﬁcantly Credit risk grades are a primary input into the determination of the term structure of PD for exposures. The Bank collects performance and default information about its credit risk exposures analysed by type of product and borrower as well as by credit risk grading. The Bank employs statistical models to analyse the data collected and generate estimates of the remaining lifetime PD of exposures and how these are expected to change as a result of the passage of time. The criteria are capable of identifying signiﬁcant increases in credit risk before an exposure is in default The criteria do not align with the point in time when an asset becomes 30 days past due The average time between the identiﬁcation of a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk and default appears reasonable Exposures are not generally transferred directly from 12-month ECL measurement to credit- impaired and There is no unwarranted volatility in loss allowance from transfers between 12-month PD Stage 1 and lifetime PD Stage 2. 92 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 The Bank monitor s the effectiveness of the criteria used to identif y signiﬁcant increases in credit risk by regular reviews to conﬁrm that Annual Report 202324 The borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank in full, without recourse by the Bank to actions such as realising security if any is held The borrower is more than 90 days past due on any material credit obligation to the Bank.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 The Bank considers a ﬁnancial asset to be in default when In assessing whether a borrower is in default, the Bank considers indicators that are The Bank incorporates forward-looking information into both the assessment of whether the credit risk of an instrument has increased signiﬁcantly since its initial recognition and the measurement of ECL. For each segment, the Bank formulates three economic scenarios a base case, which is the median scenario, and two less likely scenarios, one upside and one downside. For each sector, the base case is aligned with the macroeconomic models information value output, a measure of the predictive power of the model, as well as base macroeconomic projec tions for identiﬁed macroeconomic variables for each sector. The upside and downside scenarios are based on a combination of a percentage error factor of each sector model as well as simulated optimistic and pessimistic macroeconomic projections based on a measure of historical macroeconomic volatilities The deﬁnition of default largely aligns with that applied by the Bank for regulatory capital purposes vi. Deﬁnition of default vii. Incorporation of forward-looking information External information considered includes economic data and forecasts published by Fitch Solutions formerly known as Business Monitor International, an external and independent market intelligence and research institution. This is in addition to industry level, semi annual NPL trends across statistically comparable sectors. Periodically, the Bank carries out stress testing of more extreme shocks to calibrate its determination of the upside and downside representative scenarios. A comprehensive review is performed at least annually on the design of the scenarios by a panel of experts thatadvises the Banks senior management. The Bank has identiﬁed and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for each portfolio of ﬁnancial instruments and, using an analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between macroeconomic variables and credit risk and credit losses Annual Report 202324 The key drivers for credit risk for each of the Banks economic sectors is summarized below The Bank deﬁned a statistically signiﬁcant correlation threshold with macroeconomic of 50.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Predicted relationships between the key indicators and default rates on various portfolios of ﬁnancial assets have been developed based on analysing semi annual historical data over the past 5 years. The below scenario weightings have been observed The contractual terms of a loan may be modiﬁed for a number of reasons, including changing market conditions, customer retention and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of the customer. An existing loan whose terms have been modiﬁed may be derecognised and the renegotiated loan recognised asa new loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy set out. When the terms of a ﬁnancial asset are modiﬁed and the modiﬁcation does not result in derecognition, the determination of whether the assets credit risk has increased signiﬁcantly reﬂects comparison of its remaining lifetime PD at the reporting date based on the modiﬁed terms withthe remaining lifetime PD estimated based on data on initial recognition and the original contractual terms. When modiﬁcation results in derecognition, a new loan is recognised and allocated to Stage 1 assuming it is not credit-impaired at that time. The Bank renegotiates loans to customers in ﬁnancial difficulties referred to as forbearance activities to maximise collection opportunities and minimise the risk of default. Under the Banks forbearance policy, loan forbearance is granted on a selective basis if the debtor is currently in default on its debt or if there is a high risk of default, there is evidence that the debtor made all reasonable efforts to pay under the original contractual terms and the debtor is expected to be able to meet the revised terms. The revised terms usually include extending the maturity, changing the timing of interest payments and amending the terms of loan covenants. Both retail and corporate loans are subject to the forbearance policy. The Bank Credit Committee regularly reviews reports on forbearance activities. For ﬁnancial assets modiﬁed as part of the Banks forbearance policy, the estimate of PD reﬂects whether the modiﬁcation has improved or restored the Banks ability to collect interest and principal and the Banks previous experience of similar forbearance action. As part of this process, the Bank evaluates the borrowers payment performance against the modiﬁed contractual terms and considers various behavioural indicators. Generally, forbearance is a qualitative indicator of a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk and an expectation of forbearance may constitute evidence that an exposure is credit-impaired. A customer needs to demonstrate consistently good payment behaviour over a period of time before the exposure is no longer considered to be credit-impairedin default or the PD is considered to have decreased such that the loss allowance reverts to being measured at an amount equal to Stage 1. viii.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 The key inputs into the measurement of ECL are the term structure of the following variables Probability of default PD Loss given default LGD and Exposure at default EAD. ECL for exposures in Stage 1 is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD by LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated by multiplying the lifetime PD by LGD and EAD. The methodology of estimating PDs is discussed above under the heading Generating the term structure of PD. LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Bank estimates LGD parameters based on the history of recovery rates of claims against defaulted counterparties. The LGD models consider the structure, collateral, seniority of the claim, counterparty industry and recovery costs of any collateral that is integral to the ﬁnancial asset. EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Bank derives the EAD from the current exposure to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract and arising from amortization. The EAD of a ﬁnancial asset is its gross carrying amount at the time of default. For lending commitments, the EADs are potential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated based on historical observations and forward-looking forecasts. For ﬁnancial guarantees, the EAD represents the amount of the guaranteed exposure when the ﬁnancial guarantee becomes payable. For some ﬁnancial assets, EAD is determined by modelling the range of possible exposure outcomes at various points in time using scenario and statistical techniques. As described above, and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for Stage 1 ﬁnancial assets, the Bank measures ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period including any borrowers extension options over which it is exposed to credit risk, even if, for credit risk management purposes, the Bank considers a longer period. The maximum contractual period extends to the date at which the Bank has the right to require repayment of an advance or terminate a loan commitment or guarantee. However, for overdrafts that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment component, the Bank measures ECL over a period longer than the maximum contractual period if the Banks contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the Banks exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period. These facilities do not have a ﬁxed term or repayment structure and are managed on a collective basis. The Bank can cancel them with immediate effect but this contractual right is not enforced in the normal day-to-day management, but only when the Bank becomes aware of an increase in credit risk at the facility level. This longer period is estimated considering the credit risk management actions that the Bank expects to take, and that serve to mitigate ECL. These include a reduction in limits, cancellation of the facility andor turning the outstanding balance into a loan with ﬁxed repayment terms. Annual Report 202324 ix.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 The Bank does not offset ﬁnancial assets against ﬁnancial liabilities. The general creditworthiness of a customer tends to be the most relevant indicator of credit quality of a loan extended to it. However, collateral provides additional security and the Bank generally requests that corporate borrowers provide it. Staff loans are secured to the extent of the employees continued employment in the Bank. The Bank may take collateral in the form of a ﬁrst charge over real estate, liens and guarantees. The Bank does not sell or repledge the collateral in the absence of default by the owner of the collateral. In addition to the Banks focus on creditworthiness, the Bank aligns with its credit policy guide to periodically update the validation of collaterals held against all loans to customers. For impaired loans, the Bank obtains appraisals of collateral because the fair value of the collateral is an input to the impairment measurement. The fair value of the collaterals are based on the last revaluations carried out by the Banks in-house engineers. The valuation technique adopted for properties is in line with the Banks valuation manual and the revalued amount is similar to fair values of properties with similar size and location. The fair value of collaterals other than properties such as share certiﬁcates, cash, NBE bills etc. as disclosed at the carrying amount as management is of the opinion that the cost of the process of establishing the fair value of the collateral exceeds beneﬁts accruable from the exercise. Liquidity Risk is the potential for loss to the Bank arising from either its inability to meet its obligations or to fund increase in assets as they fall due without incurring unacceptable cost or losses Liquidity risk may not be seen in isolation as it can be triggered by other ﬁnancial risks such as credit risk, Market risk generally, liquidity risk results from size and maturity mismatch of Assets and liabilities.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Liquidity risk may not be seen in isolation as it can be triggered by other ﬁnancial risks such as credit risk, market risk, etc. Generally, liquidity risk results from size and maturity mismatch of asset and liabilities. In order to keep optimal asset-liability structure, thereby adhere to regulation in jurisdiction Boa Adopts liquidity risk management system that is governed by adequate oversight, early warning system and proper implementation of risk management process. The Bank shall form the ALCO committee whose members are drawn from its senior Management and entrust in which the responsibility of managing the overall liquidity of the Bank. Cash ﬂow forecasting is performed by the ﬁnance department. The ﬁnance department monitors rolling forecasts of liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs. The Bank has incurred indebtedness in the form of borrowings. The Bank evaluates its ability to meet its obligations on an ongoing basis. Based on these evaluations, the Bank devises strategies to manage its liquidity risk. Prudent liquidity risk management implies that sufficient cash is maintained and that sufficient funding is available to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk damage to the Banks reputation. For day-to-day liquidity management, the treasury operations will ensure sufficient funding to meet its intraday payment and settlement obligations on a timely basis. Besides, the process of managing liquidity risk also includes Maintaining a sufficient amount of unencumbered high quality liquidity buffer as a protection against any unforeseen interruption to cash ﬂows Managing short and long-term cash ﬂows via maturity mismatch report and various indicators Monitoring depositor concentration at the Bank levels to avoid undue reliance on large depositors Managing liquidity exposure by domestic and signiﬁcant foreign currencies Diversifying funding sources to ensure appropriate funding mix Conducting liquidity stress testing under various scenarios as part of prudent liquidity control Maintaining a robust contingency funding plan that includes strategies, decision-making authorities, internal and external communication and courses of action to be taken under different liquidity crisis scenarios.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 Management of market risk is an area that has received increasing attention from managers and supervisors of the globe as banks ﬁnancial trading activities have been growing from time to time. In Ethiopia, the market is not that much sensitive and involvement of banks are so limited to a few types of exposures. The risk exposures considered as relevant are interest rate and exchange rate risks, and hence, these are incorporated in this risk management program me. The risk measurement techniques employed by the Bank comprise both quantitative and qualitative measures. 4.5.1. Management of market risk Interest rate risk is the potential impact on institutions earnings and on the net-asset values of the changes of its interest rates. IRR arises when an institutions principal and cash ﬂows, both on and off the balance sheets have mismatched reprising dates. Banks are exposed to IRR because they invariably operate with unmatched balance sheet i.e. being Either IR sensitive asset or IR sensitive liabilities. The Bank are exposed to various risks associated with the effects of ﬂuctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates on the ﬁnancial position and cash ﬂows. Interest rate risk exposure is identiﬁed, measured, monitored and controlled through limits and procedures set by the ALCO to protect total net interest income from changes in market interest rates. i.

This implies an asset or investment denominated in a foreign currency will lose value as a result of Unfavorable exchange rate ﬂuctuations between the investments foreign currency and the investment holders in domestic currency. Exchange risk is associated with potential gain or loss that occurs as a result of change on exchange rate based on foreign currency holdings and liability of the Bank. Such change in value of currencies affects net open position in terms of local currency. In general, foreign exchange rate risk is potential loss as a result of adverse movement in FOREX Rates.

The Banks objectives when managing capital are to comply with the capital requirements set by the National Bank of Ethiopia, safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, and to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market conﬁdence and to sustain future development of the business. Due to this, the capital increase decision has been passed from 12.5 billion to 15 billion on the 14th extra prdinary shareholders meeting due to the following reasons According to the Licensing and Supervision of Banking Business minimum Capital Requirement for Banks Amended Directive No SBB782021 of the National Bank of Ethiopia, the Bank has to maintain capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8 at all times, the risk-weighted assets being calculated as per the provisions of Directive No SBB995. The capital adequacy ratio is the quotient of the capital base of the Bank and the Banks risk weighted asset base The capital adequacy ratios of the Bank are computed in accordance primary capital sum this includes primary capital, share premium, general reserve and legal reserve over the risk weighted asset on balance sheet and off-balance sheet.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 IFRS 13 requires an entity to classify measured or disclosed fair values according to a hierarchy that reﬂects the signiﬁcance of observable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, which comprises of three levels as described below based on the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value measurement as a whole. The fair value of the equity investments was made by the internationally known consulting ﬁrm in collaboration with other Ethiopian private banks, By using this valuation method investment securities valuation based on by multiples on actual market prices the unknown value of the valuation object is calculated based on the known values of comparable objects companies, transactions or IPOs. The selection of the appropriate multiple within a range requires judgment, considering qualitative and quantitative factors speciﬁc to the measurement. We have selected the below market multiples for the purpose of our valuation Enterprise Value to Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization EVEBITDA and Price to Book Value PBV EVEBITDA is a better measure where the leverage and net proﬁts are more vulnerable to business cycles. PBV ratio works well in the case where the business model is matured, a common measure for valuation of ﬁnancial institutions banks and insurance Companies. These institution are subject to regulatory solvency and capital adequacy requirements therefore their liquidated value fairly approximates the book values. The above measures are also consistent with the Banks previously applied market multiples. 4.7.1.

Observable input reﬂect market data obtained from independent sources unobservable inputs reﬂect the Banks market assumptions. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value measurement as a whole. The following table summarizes the carrying amounts of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities at the reporting date by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorized. The amounts are based on the values recognized in the statement of ﬁnancial position. Level 1 Inputs that are quoted market prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i.e. as prices or indirectly i.e. derived from prices .This category includes instruments valued using quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active, or other valuation technique in which all signiﬁcant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data. In conclusion, this category is for valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable. Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs. This category includes all assets and liabilities for which the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a signiﬁcant effect on the asset or liabilitys valuation. This category includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments for which signiﬁcant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reﬂect differences between the instruments. 4.7.2 Valuation models 4.7.3 Financial instruments not measured at fair value - Fair value hierarchy 110 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 The Banks investment property is measured at cost. These properties include those held for rental purposes and those in which the Bank occupies an insigniﬁcant portion. These properties are held to earn rentals and for capital appreciation. There are currently no restrictions on the reliability of these properties. Investment property is initially measured at cost including transaction costs and subsequently measured at depreciated cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives of 50 years. The fair value of investment properties has been disclosed as required. The fair value of the Banks Investment property as at June 30,2024 and has been arrived at by in-house engineers qualiﬁed estate surveyors and reviewed and approved by independent valuers. These valuers have appropriate qualiﬁcations and recent experience in the valuation of properties in the relevant locations. The fair value was determined based on the replacement cost concept which approximates the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between knowledgeable willing parties in an arms length transaction after proper marketing, prudently and without compulsion. This implies a market comparable approach that reﬂects the recent transaction prices for similar properties. In estimating the fair value of the properties, the highest and best use of the properties is their current use. There has been no change to the valuation technique during the year.

The Past Service Income in the previous year reﬂects the combined effect of removing the retirement beneﬁt for all employees, adding the 3-year service minimum for management staff, and also adding all previous provident fund members to the valuation. 28a.

The valuation assumed a rate of withdrawal of 14 at the youngest ages falling with increasing age to 2.9 at age 40. The sensitivity of the overall deﬁned beneﬁt liability to changes in the weighted principal assumption is The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation to signiﬁcant actuarial assumptions the same method present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognized within the statement of ﬁnancial position. There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior years. The average duration of the severance pay plan at the end of the reporting period is 2.78 years. 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 Males mortality rate Age Females mortality rate 0.00306 0.00303 0.00355 0.00405 0.00515 0.00450 0.00628 0.00979 0.01536 0.00223 0.00228 0.00314 0.00279 0.00319 0.00428 0.00628 0.00979 0.01536 Discount rate 1 Discount rate -1 Discount rate 1 Discount rate -1 Discount rate 1 Discount rate -1 Discount rate 1 Discount rate -1 30 june 2024 Base DBO ETB'000 311,174 311,174 311,174 311,174 291,686 332,151 332,794 290,792 -6.30 6.70 6.90 -6.60 266,600 266,600 266,600 266,600 250,555 283,823 284,515 249,675 -6.00 6.50 6.70 -6.30 DBO on changed assumptions ETB'000 change 30 june 2023 Base DBO ETB'000 DBO on changed assumptions ETB'000 change Annual Report 202324 141 BANK OF ABYSSINIA S.C.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 33. REGULATORY RISK RESERVE The NBE Directive No. SBB495 states requires the Bank to transfer annually 25 of its annual net proﬁt to its legal reserve account until such account equals its capital. When the legal reserve account equals the capital of the Bank, the amount to be transferred to the legal reserve account will be 10 ten percent of the annual net proﬁt. This account contains amount apportioned and credited from the yearly proﬁt of the BoA in accordance with the prevailing rate as per relevant NBE directive, the account is debited only when the Bank ceases its operations. The previous year's adjustments indicate that the reclassiﬁcation of the other asset provision is in accordance with the National Bank of Ethiopia's provisioning requirements, moving it from the provision liability to the regulatory risk reserve account. Where the loan loss impairment determined using the National Bank of Ethiopia NBE guidelines is higher than the loan loss impairment determined using the incurred loss model under IFRS, the difference is transferred to regulatory risk reserve and it is non-distributable to the owners of the Bank. Where the loan loss impairment determined using the National Bank of Ethiopia NBE guidelines is less than the loan loss impairment determined using the incurred loss model under IFRS, the difference is transferred from regulatory risk reserve to the retained earning to the extent of the non-distributable reserve previously recognized. Suspended interest income kept under this regulatory reserve account until the regulatory organs NBE amended the directive related with provision. This account is affected for two possible reasons one is when NBE loan and other asset provision differs from the IFRS loan and other asset provision second 70 of suspended interest income is accumulated to this account.

However, during the year the revolution surplus amount has reduced by the deprecated amount and transfer to retained earnings.
