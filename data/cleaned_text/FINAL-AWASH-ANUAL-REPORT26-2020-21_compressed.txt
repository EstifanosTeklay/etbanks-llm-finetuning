Over recent years, the Bank has increased income, capital and dividend paid out with a track record of creating a significant value for its owners. The accomplishment of the Bank as at June 30, 2021 on its major operational activities is exceedingly higher when compared with the performances of the preceding year. Accordingly, during the year under review, the aggregate deposit increased by 46 and reached Birr 108.1 billion, loans and advances surged by 52.8 and reached Birr 87.5 billion, income escalated by 34.6 and stood at Birr 13.7 billion and the gross profit grew by 34 and reached Birr 4.8 billion. The gross operating profit registered during the year in particular, is unique of its kind in the history of the private banks and the history of Awash Bank itself, reflecting the underlying strengths of the ABs business. The increments registered in the major performances of the Bank in general, and that of income and gross profit in particular, are because of the strong efforts made bank-wide to maximize the wallet-share of the Bank. The other major contributory factors are the efforts exerted in the resource mobilization activities and also the continuous hard work applied in the collection of loans and advances, as a D istinguished Shareholders, Stakeholders, Honorable Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen!! It is my honor and great pleasure to welcome you all, on behalf of the Board of Directors and on my own behalf, to the 26th Awash Banks Shareholders Annual General Meeting AGM of the FY 202021. I would also like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to our valued Customers, dedicated Management Members and all hard working Employees of the Bank for their continued trust, unshakable backing and commitments delivered to our Bank all the years that enabled the Bank to register yet again another shinning result in all spheres of its operational activities during the FY 202021. Moreover, it is my strong belief that your multifaceted support will continue to make your Bank to remain the pioneer leading private bank in the country during the coming years. The FY 202021 was the year of full of challenges and uncertainty to the country in general, and to the banking industry in particular. Some of the challenges were the elevated political instability in some parts of the country, inflation, impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and stiff competition among the different banks. In spite of these considerable hurdles and challenges, however, Awash Bank operated efficiently and once again has recorded a commendable performance and a unique result of its kind during the FY 202021. It is also important to mention that the Banks annual achievement was by far greater than the cascaded yearly target planned to be implemented, on the fifth year of the Ten Years Strategy Transformation of the Banks Vision 2025 Project. Through its past experiences, Awash Bank showed a continued progress in building a stronger and safer Bank that is capable of BOARD CHAIRMANS MESSAGE Ambassador Dr. Dibaba Abdeta Chairman Nurturing Like the River Annual Report 202021 4 result of which the status of Non-Performing Loans NPLs has remained less than 2 as at end of June 30, 2021. In general, the registered significant performances of the Bank were the sum of the wise guidance of the Board of Directors, the prudent and coordinated quality leadership of the Senior and Middle-Level Management Members as well as the unreserved commitment of the entire staff of the Bank who deserve commendations of the Board. Likewise, it is believed that the efforts made and the fast-track actions taken by the Board during the year for fundamental changes ensuring sustainable profitable growth through excellence in operation, technology ultimately customer experience has contributed to the success of the Bank out of which the following major points are to be mentioned The approval of the new organizational structure of the Bank, which composes a wide range of additional new positions, including Chief Officers, DChief Officers, Directors, DDirectors and Division Managers The approval of the new salary scale, that is commensurate with the growth level of the Bank and that helps to maintain its own staff and also attract others from the market Recognition of the Senior Middle Level Management Members and outstanding employees of the Bank Reducing the interest rate charges on the staff loans for the purchase of houses, vehicles and others to the minimum savings deposit interest rate level of 7 and The approval of essential policy matters and the encouragement made in the branch expansion and introduction of new Information Technology products. Awash Bank also engages in many different project activities, namely, IT Projects, Strategy Development Projects and the Construction of own Building Projects. Regarding the IT Projects, considering the fact that the banking sector has become increasingly tech-driven, the Bank has been focusing on vendor related IT Projects and internally developed systems solutions by the IT staff of the Bank. Through both ways the Bank is improving the status of adapting implementing modern Information Technologies. The Strategy Development Projects include, among others, the development of Digital Financial Services Strategy, SME banking Strategy and PMS. As for PMS implementation, after developing the PMS guidelines in-house, the Bank cascaded it at all levels of the Bank and the project is now fully implemented at Branches and the Head Office levels. In an effort to strengthen its asset base, and to ensure long term and sustainable growth, the Bank focused on the construction of its own buildings at different strategic areas. The Bank has already built image representing buildings at some Regional Towns, including the two buildings in Addis Ababa City. The third building in Addis Ababa City is the 13-storey Bulbula Mixed-use Building, the construction work of which has now reached 8th floor. Furthermore, the Bank has acquired plots of land both at Bale Robe and Asella Towns and their construction works are in good progress. In addition, with the desire to construct its own new Head- Quarters Building in proportion to its image and size, Awash Bank is looking for the provision of favorable construction site, particularly at the financial institutions zone, around the National Theatre area. The Addis Ababa City Administration has approved and promised the Bank to handover an ideal place and it is hoped that the handing over of the plot of land would materialize during the FY 202122. Side by side, the Bank is also making continuous efforts to buy built up buildings for its branch operations. Concerning the Human Resource Management, the Board believes that having an engaged motivated workforce a sound governance risk management are pivotal to attain the sustainable growth and the vision that the Bank aspires for, which is to be One of the Top Ten East African Banks. In this regard, the Human Resource Management Policies and Procedures of the Bank were revised to enable attracting, motivating and retaining qualified and skilled manpower. To make it practical, steps were taken Nurturing Like the River Annual Report 202021 5 On top of its corporate objectives, the contribution of the Bank to the growth of the National Economy and the wellbeing of its citizens during the year is conspicuous as observed from the annual tax paid, the financial contributions made for the national development projects of the country Gebeta Lehager, the bond purchase made in support of the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam GERD and the corporate social responsibilities fulfilled to different organizations working on social developmental activities. In conclusion, on behalf of the Board of Directors, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude to all Shareholders, Customers, Business Partners and other Stakeholders for their unwavering and indispensable support of the Banks efforts. My special thank goes to the relevant authorities, management members and the entire employees, for their passion and commitment, belongingness and hard work to upswing their Bank, in delivering commendable results and enabling the Bank to maintain its pioneer leading position among the private commercial Banks in the country. I would like to commend the National Bank of Ethiopia NBE for providing our Bank a constructive guidance and enthusiastic support. I also wish to thank Awash Banks customers for working with us and the confidence they have on our Bank. Moreover, I look forward to their continuous commitment to work with the Bank in the future to come. Finally, recalling that the Bank has come a long way so far, and has still a long way to go, I want to assure you that in the years to come, our Bank will strongly scrutinize the laid down Vision and Strategy to bring about further excellence by exploiting opportunities and vigilantly withstanding the challenging environment. Thank you, to improve manpower efficiency, focusing on optimizing the existing resource through internal job postings, transfers and skill development capacity building initiatives. The nature of the business also requires massive re-skilling of the existing workforce and continuous skill upgrading through in-house or outsourced trainings. With this in mind, the Bank has organized and implemented short- term trainings for its staff inside and outside the country and also sponsored certain number of staff to pursue higher education at different levels during the year under review. I want to stress at this point that the Board and the Management are courageous to work hard during the financial year 202122, in spite of the continuing fierce competition amongst the Banks and the persistence of the impacts of coronavirus pandemic. The Board is also fully confident that Awash Bank shall remain the leading Private Commercial Bank in the country. In addition, given the dedication of the Board, the commitment of the Management Team, the competency of the entire employees and the results registered to date, the attainment of its grand vision of becoming World Class Bank is also inevitable! The Bank continues to deliver on its strategic commitments, which drive the operational performances and create value for the Shareholders as well as the communities at large. Both the Board and the Management are determined and dedicated as before to combine their skills and energies and have begun registering yet another superior performance to maintain ABs leading position amongst the private banks of the country.

Some credit and saving share companies have also graduated from micro-finance institutions MFIs to a full-fledged commercial banks and started to become major players in the field. This has tightened the existing stiff competition among local banks for resources, both local and foreign. The 30 foreign currency surrender requirement, which is still in place, has been eroding the foreign currency stock balance of the Bank and this has also been among the serious challenges encountered during the financial year. In spite of the above challenges, however, the following opportunities were available on the other side and our Bank was able to take advantage of same to the fullest extent possible. 1. Despite COVID-19 pandemic and instability in some parts of the country, the Foreign Direct Investment FDI secured and the commodity export performance of the country for the year just ended was F irst of all, on behalf of the entire Management of Awash Bank and on my own behalf, I would like to commend my heart-felt gratitude to all respected Shareholders, dedicated Board of Directors, most valued Customers, committed and hard- working Management and staff members as well as all other stakeholders of the Bank on a remarkable achievement our Bank has recorded in all financial and non-financial parameters for the financial year ended June 30, 2021. The financial year just ended was undeniably very challenging. The novel coronavirus COVID-19, which was declared by the World Health Organization WHO as a global pandemic, has still persisted and continued to be a concerning health problem world-wide. Its economic, political, social and cultural ramifications on the well-being of societies across the globe have been unparalleled and the negative effect of the pandemic is still undesirably restrictive to almost all countries of the world. The Domino Effect of the health crisis has resulted in economic and social crisis although the effect was progressively recovering this year as compared to the preceding year. In general, the coronavirus has far-reaching consequence and as a result, business could not be as it used to be. Many economic sectors have been hard hit and our Bank has put in place some ameliorating mechanisms so that the destructive situation on business could somehow be managed and our customers would be able to sustain their business. Apart from the above, instability in some parts of the country and outbreak of war in the Northern Region has resulted in closure of branches and this has seriously affected our business. CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS STATEMENT Tsehay Shiferaw Chief Executive Officer Nurturing Like the River Annual Report 202021 15 commendable as compared to last year same period. As a result, the foreign currency earned by our Bank, nearly USD 902 Million, was better this year as compared to last year same period, which was USD 869 Million. This was an increment of USD 32 Million, or 3.8. 2. The National Bank of Ethiopia issued Directive No. CMD22020 on Legal Tender Currency Notes Redemption on September 14, 2020. The currency redemption has gone and concluded extremely well and our Bank was able to mobilize a good sum of resources. A good number of new accounts has also been opened as a result. 3. As per the decision of the Board, 50,400 shares, worth Birr 50.4 Million, have been awarded to Senior Management, Middle Management and selected Branch Managers and this has greatly fortified the moral and belongingness of the awardees. Thanks to the Board, the remarkable performance of the Bank for the year just ended was a cumulative effect of this decision also, 4. According to African Business, Africas Top 100 Banks 2020, Awash Bank stood 90 out of a total of 100 and 14 from East African banks. No East African banks have managed to gain a place in the Top 10 of the overall ranking of Africas Top 100 banks in 2020. This has greatly enhanced the image of the Bank, 5. World Savings Banks Institute WSBI welcomed six new members at its recent Board and General Assembly and Awash Bank was one of the newly accepted members. The WSBI helps members to boost their business development efforts, promote members best practices, transfer knowledge among members and foster cooperation. No doubt, being a member of the group will enhance the reputation of our Bank in the times to come. These being the available opportunities, with a concerted effort of all, our Bank has performed extremely well in all parameters in the financial year just ended as can be seen below. Gross profit before tax stood at Birr 4.8 Billion from Birr 3.6 Billion of last year same period i.e. Birr 1.2 Billion or 34 growth. This is the highest performance ever registered in the history of our Bank. Following the Shareholders decision at the 16th Extra-ordinary Meeting to raise the paid-up capital of the Bank from Birr 6 Billion to Birr 12 Billion in three years time, the paid-up capital has now reached Birr 8.19 Billion from Birr 5.85 Billion of last year same period that is, an increment of Birr 2.34 Billion or an increase by 40. Reflecting the surge in paid-up capital, earning per share EPS has modestly declined to 470 in FY 202021 from 510 in FY201920 for a par value of Birr 1,000 which, I believe, is still very lucrative and encouraging to the shareholders. As a result of enhanced operation, inflationary situation for goods and services, opening of 100 new branches and unexpected costs in connection with the prevention of the spread of coronavirus COVID-19, total expense of the Bank has gone up from Birr 6.61 Billion in 2020 to Birr 8.92 Billion in 2021. Of the total expense items, personnel expense, interest expense, and other operating expenses took the highest share in their order. Total deposit as at June 30, 2021 stood at Birr 108.1 Billion and that was the highest deposit balance ever registered in our Bank as well as in the history of private banks. The deposit balance grew by Birr 33.81 Billion or an increase by 46 in 2021. Total asset drastically grew from Birr 89.30 Billion in 2020 to Birr 128.70 Billion in 2021 i.e., a growth of Birr 39.40 Billion or 44, and that is the highest figure registered by all standards. Loans and advances took the biggest share of the total asset accounting 67 of the total asset of the Bank. NBE bills accounted for Birr 9.92 Billion or 7.7 of the total asset, but this is being redeemed at maturity, which will enhance the liquidity position of the Bank. Nurturing Like the River Annual Report 202021 16 The NPLs ratio as at June 30, 2021 stood at 1.9 and this was by far lower than the threshold i.e. 5, set by the NBE. The NPLs ratio in comparison with the total loan portfolio is not as such big but all possible effort will be exerted to maintain it at the lowest possible limit. The total number of branches of the Bank as at end of June 2021 reached 566. In general, the financial year 202021 was blossoming in many aspects and the major success stories were the following 1. For the fifth time, our Bank has successfully achieved all the targets set in the Grand Strategy. Hence, our journey framed five years ago to Become One of the Top Ten East African Commercial Banks by the Year 2025 is expected to be attainable, 2. The Core Banking Upgrading project has gone live as of March 1, 2021. At this juncture, I would like to extend my gratitude to all IT teams and support staff for the work well done and that their commitment in making it a successful project is praiseworthy, 3. The Revised Organizational Structure of the Bank has been deliberated, approved and implemented since the second half of the year, 4. The Performance Management System PMS, which is internally developed for the planning, rewarding, capacity development and staff motivation, has been successfully implemented in the financial year. As a result, the rewards conferred to all staff members at the end of the year was based solely on their performance evaluation results, 5. The deposit balance of our Bank exceeded Br. 100 Billion mark as on June 17, 2021. This was the first of its kind in the private banking industry, and 6. The newly established regional offices named Wolayita Sodo Region and Dessie Region have become operational during the year. Despite the above success stories, however, the year ahead is expected to be challenging. Banks are especially expected to be challenged with the following objective realities i. The situation of peace and stability in some parts of the country and the war in the Northern Region, ii. The prevalence of the new version COVID-19 pandemic and its serious impact on doing business, iii. The stiff competition among existing and new banks for deposit, both local and foreign, and the 30 foreign currency surrender requirement, iv. Country-level double-digit inflation rate for food and non-food items, which is expected to escalate the expenses of the Bank etc Im, however, very optimistic and of the opinion that things will get better as time passes by and Awash will keep on doing even better to satisfy the interests of its stakeholders. Taking this opportune moment, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation once again to our valued customers for their loyalty, and committed Management and strong staff members for the remarkable performance registered in 202021. At the end, I would also like to thank all Shareholders, Board of Directors, our Correspondent Banks, Federal and Regional Government Offices and especially the National Bank of Ethiopia and Financial Intelligence Center for their relentless support, advice and guidance in our day-to-day activities. Thank you all! May God bless us and our country!

Awash Bank continues to deliver superior operational and financial performances among private banks operating in Ethiopia, further cementing its leading position in key performance areas such as total deposits, loans and advances, total assets, capital base and profit. The recovery of global economy from the negative impacts of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, conducive policy environment pursued by the Ethiopian Government and the executions of innovative and tailor-made strategy by the Bank has greatly helped for the impressive performances recorded by Awash Bank during FY 202021. On the other hand, double digit inflation for food and non-food items, foreign currency shortage as witnessed by widening of the gap between the parallel and the official exchange rates and prevalence of internal conflicts in some parts of the country were the major macro-economic challenges observed in FY 202021. During financial year 202021, the National Bank of Ethiopia has taken various reform measures that have directly or indirectly boosted the operational and financial performances of banks. These include, among others, introduction of cash withdrawal limit for individual persons and companies, redemption of the legal tender currency Birr notes of 10, 50, and 100 and introduction of new Birr 200 denomination and continuation of the waiver of the obligatory NBE bills purchase. 1. OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCES Awash Bank registered commendable operational results during the period under review, indicating on-track move of the Bank towards attaining its aspiration of becoming One of the Top Ten Private Banks in East Africa by 2025. 1.1. DEPOSITS MOBILIZATION Total deposits of the Bank, including LC margin and deposits from Interest Free Banking IFB, grew by Birr 33.8 billion 45.5 percent and reached Birr 108.1 billion at the end of June,2021. Awash Bank is, of course, not only the first but also the only Ethiopian private bank to surpass the Birr 100 billion mark in total deposits at the end of the reporting period. This historic and commendable achievement of the Bank was mainly attributable to aggressive expansion of the customer base of the Bank, offering of different deposit products to different customer segments, and expansion of different digital and conventional service delivery channels, including full-fledged IFB branches. During FY 202021 alone, about two million new customers have opened deposit accounts with Awash Bank. In addition, both mobile and internet banking services subscribers have reached over two million at the end of the report period. Moreover, deposit mobilized from Interest Free Banking line of business has witnessed encouraging performance and reached Birr 7.49 billion as at June 30, 2021 registering a net increment of Birr 3.54 billion 89.5 percent over last year same period. Nurturing Like the River Annual Report 202021 20 Composition of deposits revealed that the more stable saving deposits accounted for 59 percent, followed by low-cost demand deposits 30 percent, time deposits 6 percent and letter of credit margin 5 percent.

INTERNATIONAL BANKING SERVICES The overarching objectives of the Bank with regard to International Banking Services are facilitating the flow of goods and services across the globe and generation of foreign currency from different sources through maintaining good relationship with correspondent banks, international money transfer and payment operators, NGOs and recipients of remittances. During the period under review, Awash Bank has devised a new lottery-based scheme called ይቆጥቡይቀበሉይሸለሙ meaning Save, Receive and Win that will motivate both savers and recipients of remittances to conduct transactions through Awash Bank and win the lottery prizes. Moreover, Awash Bank has strengthened its relationship with correspondent banks to the extent of getting the Bank labeled as the most reliable and dependable private bank in Ethiopia. Reflecting the effort of the Bank, the foreign currency generated during the period under review grew by USD 32.4 million over the same period of last year and reached USD 901.8 million at the end of June, 2021. This result was commendable, given the existence of stiff competition among local banks, widening of foreign exchange premium in the parallel market and slowdown of foreign exchange inflows due to, among others, COVID 19 pandemic. 1.4. TOTAL ASSETS As at June 30,2021, total asset of the Bank reached Birr 128.7 billion, depicting a growth of Birr 39.4 billion 44.1 Percent over the corresponding period of last year. Of the total asset, net loans and advances took the lions share of Birr 86 billion 67 percent. The significant growth in the asset size of the Bank was largely attributed to the increase in loans and advances to customers and investment on fixed assets, which would ensure a sustainable growth of the Bank in the long run. The continuous surge in the asset position of the Bank over the last two decades reveals that Awash Banks growth is organic, in the right way and within the risk appetite of the Bank.
