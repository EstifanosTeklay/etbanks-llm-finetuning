Moreover, the bank has continued to instill saving culture in the society through aggressive awareness creation activities on its products and services. Remarkable achievement was registered in mobilizing incremental deposit, amounting to Birr 76.4 billion during the year, achieving the overall deposit position of Birr 365.1 billion. Furthermore, the bank has maintained its leading role in modernizing the countrys payment system through investing and introducing new banking technologies that enable to deliver effective and efﬁcient services to customers.

Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 2 Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 2 1. Global and Domestic Economic Highlights 1.1 Global Economy 1. 2 Ethiopian Economy The global economy is estimated to have grown by 3.7 in 2017, up from the post-crisis low of 2.4 in 2016 IMF, 2018. In emerging markets and developing economies barriers to growth among commodity exporters are gradually diminishing and activities in commodity importers remain generally robust. Growth in the advanced economies has strengthened with investment and exports regaining momentum after subdued growth in 2016. Import demand has strengthened, further contributing to a recovery in global trade. Thus, growth in the advanced economies is estimated to have increased to 2.3 in 2017. After the sharp deceleration to 1.3 in 2016, growth in Sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to recover to 2.6 in 2017 WB, 2017. The growth is supported by modestly rising commodity prices, strengthening external demand and the end of drought in several countries. It reﬂects the continued expansion in public investment, strong services sector and the recovery of agricultural production. Global trade growth is estimated to rebound to 4.7 in 2017 from 2.5 in 2016 IMF, 2018. The recovery in trade growth is supported by stronger import demand from major advanced economies, increased trade ﬂows to and from China. Generally, global output growth and trade appear to have assumed a healthy trend. But global prices for most primary commodities of interest to Ethiopia remain suppressed and volatile. The outlook for the coming year also looks no better for these commodities which will have some negative impact on Ethiopias export performance. The Ethiopian economy registered a 10.9 growth in 201617, showing a recovery from challenging macroeconomic and weather conditions of the previous year. The growth in real GDP was mainly due to 18.6 growth in industrial output, 10.3 increase in service sector, and 6.7 expansion in agriculture NBE, 2017. Industrial sector output growth accounted for 25.6 of GDP. The sector contributed 40.4 to the overall economic growth during the ﬁscal year. The service sector continued to dominate the economy as its share in GDP was about 39.3 and its contribution to GDP growth reached 36.7. The 10.3 growth in service sector was largely attributed to the expansion of public administration 22.1, transport and communication 12.1, and wholesale and retail trade 7.6 activities. This gradual but steady shift in the structure of the economy reﬂects the tremendous effort made in developing the manufacturing sector and promoting exported growth while continuing to give due attention to modernizing the agriculture sector that has long dominated the countrys economic base. Per capita income, which was USD 784 in 201516, grew to USD 863 in 201617. Poverty declined to 23. Moreover, investment to GDP ratio was high at 39, and domestic savings to GDP ratio at 24.1. Similarly, the annual average inﬂation went down to 7.2 from 9.7 a year ago. This was largely because of the 3.9 decline in food and non-alcoholic beverages inﬂation, and a 1.1 drop in non-food inﬂation from 8.1 to 7. In the meantime, annual headline inﬂation jumped to 8.8 in 201617 from 7.5 as food inﬂation increased by 4 percentage point, despite a 1.8 percentage point drop in non-food inﬂation NBE, 2017. Generally, economic performance remained robust in 201617. Nevertheless, poor export performance looks the weakest spot in the macroeconomic landscape of the country. Against this backdrop, however, the economic prospects for 201718 are envisaged to remain positive, despite some downside risks related to commodity price shocks, temporary inﬂation pressure and weather conditions.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. A, Group and consolidation The scope of our Group audit was determined by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope on the audit work at all companies operating within the Group, all of which were subject to full audits. Our audit work was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality. At the Bank level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures. B. Loans and advances There are risks that loans and advances may be given without proper managerial approval may not be accurately recorded do not exist may not be recorded at appropriate values and all bad and doubtful balances may not have been provided for or written off. In our response to these risks, we assessed the reasonableness of the design of the system of internal control by enquiring of relevant Bank personnel and reviewing the documented system developed by the Bank. We tested this system in order to confirm our understanding of it. We identified the preventive and detective controls. We checked a sample of selected transactions covering the whole year to see that all controls were exercised on all transactions. For a sample of disbursements made during the year, we checked the approval by the appropriate level of management and checked that all formalities necessary before disbursement of loans and advances had been fulfilled. We test checked loan agreements and legal documents to verify the terms and conditions of the loans and advances. We obtained an analysis of loans and verified that they had been classified in correct categories and we considered the value of collateral available against each loan for calculating the provision for doubtful loans and advances. Our testing did not identify major weaknesses in the design and operation of controls that would have required us to expand the nature or scope of our planned detailed test work. Overall, we found no concerns in respect to the completion of formalities or the recording of loans and advances at appropriate values. dee INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE SUPERVISING AUTHORITY OF COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA continued Key Audit Matters continued G Capital increase It was considered that there was a possible risk that specific aspects of the capital increase may not have been legally correct. We followed the legal steps involved by reference to the documentation and discussed the valuation of the additional contribution in cash and in kind with appropriate officials of the Bank. We have no concern regarding the increase in capital. D. Dividends A dividend based on the profit of the year is stated as a liability. The propriety of this was discussed with the appropriate officials and documentation obtained to support this contention. We found the inclusion of the dividend as a liability to be acceptable. Responsibilities of the Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRSs, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Groups financial reporting process. Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. dee INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE SUPERVISING AUTHORITY OF COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA continued Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements continued As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also e Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Groups internal control. e Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. e Conclude on the appropriateness of managements use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Groups ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. e Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. hac INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE SUPERVISING AUTHORITY OF COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA continued Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements continued From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors report is Woizero Banchiayehu Tamirat. 11 February 2019 6 Statement of Directors Responsibility The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements of Commercial Bank of Ethiopia The Group, comprising the statement of financial position as at 30 June 2017, statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended and the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes, in accordance with International Financial Reporting StandardsIFRS. To enable the Directors to meet those responsibilities, the Board of Directors the "Board" and management sets standards and management implements systems of internal control, accounting and information systems aimed at providing reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and the risk of error, fraud or loss is reduced in a cost effective manner. These controls, contained in established policies and procedures, include the proper delegation of responsibilities and authorities within a clearly defined framework, effective accounting procedures and adequate segregation of duties. To their best knowledge and belief, based on the above, the Directors are satisfied that no material breakdown in the operation of the systems of internal control and procedures has occurred during the year under review. The Directors have reviewed the performance and financial position of the Group to the date of signing of these financial statements and its prospects based on prepared budgets, and are satisfied that the Group is a going concern and, therefore, have adopted the going concern assumption in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements. Approval of the annual financial statements The financial statements on pages 7 to 140 were approved by the Board of Directors on 11 February, 2019.

Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 24 1 REPORTING ENTITY Commercial Bank of Ethiopia the Bank is a ﬁnancial institution established in 1942 as State Bank of Ethiopia and later incorporated as a limited liability public enterprise pursuant to the laws of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia on 16 December 1963 for an indeﬁnite time period as a holding Bank. The Bank's registered ofﬁce is in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and it has 1,222 branches. 2 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the ﬁnancial statements of the Bank and two entities controlled by the Bank- its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group or individually as Group entities. Control is achieved where the Bank has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operation policies of an entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities. 3 BASIS OF PREPARATION a Statement of compliance The Group's consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with interna- tional Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Stan- dards Board IASB. The designation IFRS includes all standards issued by the IASB and related interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC. b Basis of measurement The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the following signiﬁcant items 1. Equity instruments measured at fair value 2. Non-current assets held for sale measured at lower of their carrying amounts and fair value less costs to sell and 3.The liability for deﬁned beneﬁt obligations is recognized as the present value of the deﬁned obligation plus unrecognized actuarial gains less unrecognized past service cost and unrecognized actuarial losses. Continue COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 201617 25 3 BASIS OF PREPARATION -continued c Use of judgments and estimates In preparing these consolidated ﬁnancial statements, management has made judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Group's accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively. Judgments Information about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most signiﬁcant effects on the amounts recognized in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements is included in the following note Note 4 a- determination of control over investees. Management used the control model under IFRS 10, to determine whether the control indicators set out in note 4a indicate that the Group controls a trust, an investment fund or an entity without ownership interest. Assumptions and estimation uncertainties Note 4c,kand note 4 j - identiﬁcation and measurement of impairment for ﬁnancial instruments Note 4 g and note 4 j- useful lives of tangible and intangible assets Note 4 n - measurement of deﬁned beneﬁts obligations key actuarial assumptions Note 4m and note 4t - recognition and measurement of provisions and contingencies Note 4s - recognition of deferred taxes. Information on assumptions and uncertainty of estimates posing a signiﬁcant risk of resulting in a material adjustment is presented as follows a Allowance for loan losses Loans are assessed for impairment on a regular basis for any events that may produce such impair- ment and adjusted if appropriate in proﬁt or loss of the year. In determining whether an impairment loss should be recorded in proﬁt or loss, the Group makes decisions as to whether there is any observable data indicating that there is a reduction of the loan value that can be measured in the estimated future cash ﬂows of loans . Continue COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 26 3 BASIS OF PREPARATION -continued a Allowance for loan losses-continued This evidence includes observable data indicating that there has been an adverse change in the payment status of borrowers, or economic conditions that correlate with defaults on loans. The methodology and assumptions used to estimate the amount and time of future cash ﬂows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience see note 4c. b Deferred tax The Group is subject to income tax under different jurisdictions. Estimates are made through a tax projection for determining the provision for income taxes and liabilities resulting from this estimate are recognized. When the ﬁnal tax outcome is different from the amounts that were recorded, differences will impact the provision for income taxes and deferred taxes in the period in which such determination is made see note 4s. 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements. a Details of Consolidation i. Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are investees controlled by the Group. The Group controls a subsidiary if it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The Group reassesses whether it has control if there are changes to one or more of the elements of control. The ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries, as described below, and are included in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements from the date on which control commences until the date when control ceases. Continue COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 201617 27 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued a Details of Consolidation Continued The Group's subsidiaries are as follows ii. Associates Associates are all entities over which the Group has signiﬁcant inﬂuence but no control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20 and 50 of the voting rights. Investments in associ- ates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the investments are initially recognized at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize the investor's share of proﬁt or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but signiﬁcant inﬂuence is retained, only a propor- tionate share of the amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income OCI is reclassi- ﬁed to proﬁt or loss as appropriate. The Group's share of its associates' post-acquisition proﬁts or losses is recognized in proﬁt or loss. When the Group's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. Proﬁts and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the group and its associate are recognized in the Group's ﬁnancial statements only to the extent of unrelated par- ties' interests in the associates. iii. Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra- group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the invest- ment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. 30 June 2017 30 June 2016 Name Principal place of business Commercial Nominees PLC Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia 99.99 99.99 CBE Southern Sudan Limited South Sudan 100 100 CBE Djibouti Limited Djibouti 100 -- Continue COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 28 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued b Foreign currency i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currency of Groups entities at the spot exchange rate at the date of the transitions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between the amortized cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the year, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the year, and the amortized cost in the foreign currency translated at the spot exchange rate at the end of the year. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate at the date on which the fair value is determined. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction. These consolidated ﬁnancial statements are presented in Ethiopian Birr "ETB", which is the Group's functional currency. The loans granted and liabilities contracted are in Ethiopian Birr, which is the currency that predominates in the economic environment where the Group operates. Similarly, the main cash ﬂows for settled goods and services, taxes and other obligations are in Birr. For entities incorporated in Ethiopia the legal currency is the Ethiopian Birr whereas for the entities incorporated in South Sudan the legal currency is the South Sudanese pound while Djibouti Franc is the legal currency in Djibouti. ii Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into Ethiopian Birr ETB at the spot exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Ethiopian Birr ETB at the spot exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. In view of the hyperinﬂationary economy in some corresponding ﬁgures of the foreign subsidiary for previous periods are restated to adjust for changes in the purchasing power of the functional currency. That subsidiary's ﬁnancial statements are based on the historical cost approach. Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income OCI, and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve. Continue COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 201617 29 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued c Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities i Classiﬁcation Financial assets The Group classiﬁes its ﬁnancial assets into one of the following categories a loans and receivables b held to maturity c available-for-sale and d at fair value through proﬁt or loss. Financial liabilities The Group classiﬁes its ﬁnancial liabilities, other than ﬁnancial guarantees and loan commitments, as measured at amortized cost or fair value through proﬁt or loss. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the Group provides money directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable. They include mortgage and advances to customers, staff loans and placements with other banks. Loans and advances are subsequently measured at their amortised cost using the effective interest method. Held to maturity Held to maturity investments are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments and ﬁxed maturities that the Group's management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. If the Group were to sell other than an insigniﬁcant amount of held to maturity assets, the entire category would be tainted and reclassiﬁed as available for sale. These investments are held at amortised cost. Continue COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 30 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued c Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities Continued Available for sale Available for sale ﬁnancial assets are those non-derivative ﬁnancial assets that are designated as available for sale and are not classiﬁed as a loans and receivables b held to maturity or c ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss. These assets are measured at fair value. ii Recognition The Group initially recognizes loans and advances, deposits and borrowings from other banks on the date on which they are originate. All other ﬁnancial instruments including regular-way purchases and sales of ﬁnancial assets are recognized on the trade date, which is the date on which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A ﬁnancial asset or ﬁnancial liability is measured initially at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. iii Derecognition The Group derecognizes a ﬁnancial asset when the contractual rights to the cash ﬂows from the ﬁnancial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash ﬂows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the ﬁnancial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the ﬁnancial asset. On derecognition of a ﬁnancial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognized and the sum of i the consideration received including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed and ii any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in OCI is recognized in proﬁt or loss. In transactions in which the Group neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of a ﬁnancial asset and it retains control over the asset, the Group continues to recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset. Financial liabilities The Group derecognizes a ﬁnancial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. Continue Financial assets COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 201617 31 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued c Financial a ssets and ﬁnancial liabilities Continued Financial assets If the terms of a ﬁnancial asset are modiﬁed, the Group evaluates whether the cash ﬂows of the modi- ﬁed asset are substantially different. If the cash ﬂows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash ﬂows from the original ﬁnancial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original ﬁnancial asset is derecognized and a new ﬁnancial asset is recognized at fair value. If the terms of a ﬁnancial asset were modiﬁed because of ﬁnancial difﬁculties of the borrower and the asset was not derecognized, then impairment of the asset was measured using the pre-modiﬁcation interest rate. Financial liabilities The Group derecognizes a ﬁnancial liability when its terms are modiﬁed and the cash ﬂows of the modiﬁed liability are substantially different. In this case, a new ﬁnancial liability based on the modiﬁed terms is recognized at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the ﬁnancial liability extinguished and the new ﬁnancial liability with modiﬁed terms is recognized in proﬁt or loss. v Offsetting Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statement of ﬁnancial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intents either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS, or for gains and losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Group's trading activity. vi Amortized cost measurement The 'amortized cost' of a ﬁnancial asset or ﬁnancial liability is the amount at which the ﬁnancial asset or ﬁnancial liability is measured at initial recognition, minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between the initial amount recognized and the maturity amount, minus any reduction for impairment. Continue iv Modiﬁcations of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 32 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued c Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities Continued vii Fair value measurement Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reﬂects its non performance risk. When available, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufﬁcient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Group uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. There is no active market or observable prices to measure the Group's ﬁnancial assets or ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value. Fair value of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities is determined at each reporting date for disclosure in the ﬁnancial statement purposes only. viii Impairment At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that ﬁnancial assets not carried at fair value through proﬁt or loss are impaired. A ﬁnancial asset or a group of ﬁnancial assets is 'impaired' when objective evidence demonstrates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the assets and that the loss event has an impact on the future cash ﬂows of the assets that can be estimated reliably. Objective evidence that ﬁnancial assets are impaired includes signiﬁcant ﬁnancial difﬁculty of the borrower or issuer default or delinquency by a borrower the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise indications that a borrower or issuer will enter bankruptcy the disappearance of an active market for a security or Observable data relating to a group of assets such as adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or issuers in the group, or economic conditions that correlate with defaults in the group.

Impairment Continued A loan that was renegotiated due to deterioration in the borrower's condition was usually considered to be impaired unless there was evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash ﬂows had reduced signiﬁcantly and there were no other indicators of impairment. In addition, for an investment in an equity security, a signiﬁcant or prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost was objective evidence of impairment. The Group considers evidence of impairment for loans and advances and held-to-maturity Debt securities at both a speciﬁc asset and a collective level. All individually signiﬁcant loans and advances and held-to-maturity.Debt securities are assessed for speciﬁc impairment. Those found not to be speciﬁcally impaired are then collectivelyassessed for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet identiﬁed. Loans and advances and held-to-maturity Debt securities that are not individually signiﬁcant are collectively assessed for impairment by group - ing together loans and advances and held-to-maturity Debt securities with similar characteristics. In making an assessment of whether an investment in sovereign debt was impaired, theGroup considered the following factors. The market's assessment of creditworthiness as reﬂected in the bond yields. The rating agencies' assessments of creditworthiness. The country's ability to access the capital markets for new debt issuance. The probability of debt being restructured, resulting in holders suffering losses through voluntary or mandatory debt forgiveness. The international support mechanisms in place to provide the necessary support as 'lender of last resort' to that country, as well as the intention, reﬂected in public statements, of governments and agencies to use those mechanisms. This included an assessment of the depth of those mechanisms and, irrespective of the political intent, whether there was the capacity to fulﬁll the required criteria. An individual measurement of impairment was based on management's best estimate of the present value of the cash ﬂows that were expected to be received. Inestimating these cash ﬂows, management made judgments about a debtor's ﬁnancial situation and the net realisable value of any underlying collateral. Each impaired asset was assessed on its merits, and the workout strategy and estimate of cash ﬂows considered recoverable were independently approved by the Credit Risk function. Individual and collective assessment COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 34 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued c Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities Continued viii. Impairment Continued Individual or collective Assessment Continued In assessing the need for collective loss allowance, managementconsidered factors such as credit quality, portfolio size, concentrations and economic factors. To estimate the required allowance, assumptions were made to deﬁne how inherent losses were modeled and to determine the required input parameters, based on historical experience and current economic conditions. The accuracy of the allowance depended on the model assumptions and parameters used in determining the collec - tive allowance. Loans that were subject to a collective IBNR provision were not considered impaired. Measurement of impairment Impairment losses on assets measured at amortised cost were calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. Impairment losses on available-for-sale assets were calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value. In respect of assets measured at amortised cost If, an event occurring after the impairment was recognised caused the amount of impairment loss to decrease, then the decrease in impairment loss was reversed through proﬁt or loss. In respect of available-for-sale debt security If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of an impaired debt security increased and the increase could be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, then the impairment loss was reversed through proﬁt or loss otherwise, any increase in fair value was recognised through OCI. Any subsequent recovery in the fair value of an impaired available-for-sale equity security was always recognised in OCI. Presentation Impairment losses were recognised in proﬁt or loss and reﬂected in an allowance account against loans and receivables or held-to-maturity debt securities. Interest on the impaired assets continued to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount. Impairment losses on available-for-sale Debt securities were recognised by reclassifying the losses accumulated in the fair value reserve in equity to proﬁt or loss. The cumulative loss that was reclassiﬁed from equity to proﬁt or loss was the difference between the acquisition cost, net of any principal repayment and amortisation, and the current fair value, less any The collective allowance for groups of homogeneous loans was established using statistical methods such as roll rate methodology or, for small portfolios with insufﬁcient information, a formula approach based on historical loss rate experience. The roll rate methodology used statistical analysis of historical data on delinquency to estimate the amount of loss. Management applied judgement to ensure that the estimate of loss arrived at on the basis of historical information was appropriately adjusted to reﬂect the economic conditions and product mix at the reporting date. Roll rates and loss rates were regularly benchmarked against actual loss experience. The IBNR incurred but not reported allowance covered credit losses inherent inportfolios of loans and advances, and held-to-maturity Debt securities with similarcredit risk characteristics when there was objective evidence to suggest that they contained impaired items but the individual impaired items could not yet be identiﬁed.

Impairment Continued impairment loss previously recognised in proﬁt or loss. Changes in impairment attributable to the application of the effective interest method were reﬂected as a component of interest income. Write-off The Group wrote off a loan or an investment debt security, either partially or in full, and any related allowance for impairment losses, when Group Credit determined that there was no realistic prospect of recovery. d Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprise cash on hand, placements with other banks, cash reserve with the National Bank of Ethiopia, payment and settlement account with the National Bank of Ethiopia, cash in Transit, cash reserve with the Bank of South Sudan, payment and settlement account with the Bank of South Sudan, Cash reserve with Central Bank of Djibouti, and payment and settlement account with Cen- tral Bank of Djibouti. Cash equivalents are deemed of immediate realization since they are easily convertible into cash within three months following the date of the ﬁnancial statements. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost in the statement of ﬁnancial position e Loans and advances Loans and advances are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and that the Group does not intend to sell immediately or in the near term. Loans and advances to banks are classiﬁed as loans and receivables. Loans and advances to customers include those classiﬁed as loans and receivables Loans and advances were initially measured at fair value plus incremental direct transaction costs less fee collected and subsequently measured at their amortized cost using the effective interest method. f Debt securities Government securities and coupons and corporate bonds are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments and ﬁxed maturity that the Group has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, and which are not designated as at fair value through proﬁt or loss or as available- for-sale. They are measured at amortized cost plus accrued interest. Equity investments that the Group holds are not for trading purpose classiﬁed as available-for-sale and measured at fair value through OCI. COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 36 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued g Property, plant and equipment i Recognition and measurement Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, which includes capitalized borrowing costs, less accumulated depreciation and cumulative impairment losses. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalized as part of that equipment. The cost of property, plant and equipment acquired in a business combination is determined at the acquisition date, based on fair values according to appraisals performed by independent experts. If signiﬁcant parts of an item of property or equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items major components of property and equipment. Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognized net within operating and administrative expenses in proﬁt or loss. ii Subsequent costs Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it is probable that the future economic beneﬁts of the expenditure will ﬂow to the Group. Minor ongoing repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. iii Depreciation Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property and equipment less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and is generally recognized in proﬁt or loss. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation is charged on the straight line basis at the following rates per annum. - Building 5 - Computer equipment 25 - Fixtures, ﬁttings and equipment 20 - Motor vehicles 20 Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each ﬁnancial year-end and adjusted if appropriate. Minor repairs and maintenance costs are expense as incurred. The depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values were reviewed and adjusted appropriately at transition date. COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 201617 37 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued h Leases a Group acting as a lessee The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset at cost and a lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses the lessee's incremen- tal borrowing rate. After the commencement date, the Group measures the right-of-use asset applying a cost model cost less any cumulative depreciation and any cumulative impairment. In the case of the lease liabil- ity, the Group measure it by increasing the carrying amount to reﬂect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reﬂect the lease payments made, and re-measuring the carrying amount to reﬂect any reassessment or lease modiﬁcations or to reﬂect revised in - substance ﬁxed lease payments. b Group acting as a lessor - Finance leases Where the Group is the lessor, the Group classiﬁes each of its leases as either an operating lease or a ﬁnance lease. Finance lease With a lease agreement that transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to owner- ship of the asset to the lessee, then the arrangement is classiﬁed as a ﬁnance lease and a receiv- able equal to the net investment in the lease is recognized and presented within receivables. The Group recognizes assets held under a ﬁnance lease in its statement of ﬁnancial position and presents them as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. After the initial measurement, the Group recognizes ﬁnance income over the lease term, based on a pattern reﬂecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor's net investment in the lease. Operating lease The Group recognizes lease payments from operating leases as income on either a straight-line basis or another systematic basis. The Group applies another systematic basis if that basis is more representative of the pattern in which beneﬁt from the use of the underlying asset is diminished. i Investment property Investment property is property held either to earn rental income, capital appreciation, or both, and is not intended to be sold in the normal course of business. Investment property is recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation and cumulative impairment losses. When the use of a property changes such that it is reclassiﬁed as property and equipment, its carrying value at the date of reclassiﬁcation becomes its cost for subsequent accounting. COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 38 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued Software acquired by the Group is measured at cost less accumulated amortization and any impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure on software assets is capitalized only when it increases the future economic beneﬁts embodied in the speciﬁc asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred. Software is amortized on a straight-line basis in proﬁt or loss over its estimated useful life, from the date on which it is available for use. The estimated useful life of software for the current and com- parative periods is four years. Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted as found appropriate. k Impairment of non-ﬁnancial assets At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-ﬁnancial assets other than deferred tax assets to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inﬂows from continuing use that is largely independent of the cash inﬂows of other assets or cash generating units CGU. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. 'Value in use' is based on the estimated future cash ﬂows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset or CGU. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. The Group's corporate assets do not generate separate cash inﬂows and are used by more than one CGU. Corporate assets are allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the CGUs to which the corporate assets are allocated. Impairment losses are recognized in proﬁt or loss. They are allocated ﬁrst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. j Intangible assets Software COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 201617 39 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued I Deposits from banks and customers Deposits and borrowings are the Group's sources of debt funding. These liabilities are initially mea- sured at fair value minus incremental direct transaction costs, and subsequently measured at their amortized cost using the effective interest method. m Provisions A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outﬂow of economic beneﬁts will be required to settle the obligation. n Employee beneﬁts i. Deﬁned beneﬁt plans A deﬁned beneﬁt plan is a post-employment beneﬁt plan at the termination of the employment rela- tionship, other than a deﬁned contribution plan. The Group accounts not only its legal obligation under the formal term described above, also for any constructive obligation that arises from the Group's customary practices. A customary practice gives rise to a constructive obligation where the Group has no realistic alternatives but to pay employee beneﬁts. The Group's net obligation in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future beneﬁts that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods that beneﬁt is discounted to determine its present value, and any unrecognized past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on governmental bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group's obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the beneﬁts are expected to be paid. The calculation is performed annually by a qualiﬁed actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the beneﬁts of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased beneﬁt relating to past service by employees is recognized in proﬁt or loss on a straight-line basis over the average period until the beneﬁts become vested.To the extent that the beneﬁts vest immediately, the expense is recognized immediately in proﬁt or loss. The Group recognizes all actuarial gains and losses arising from deﬁned beneﬁt plans in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. iv. Short-term beneﬁts Short-term employee beneﬁt obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related services are provided, current wages including medical expenses, being taken into consideration. Liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash and includes mainly COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 40 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued n. Employee beneﬁts Continued wages and salaries, bonuses, leave beneﬁts and other allowances, and incentives to pay this amount as a result of past services provided by the employees, and the obligation can be estimated reliably. According to Law, in case of unjustiﬁed dismissal, employers are obligated to pay to their employees compensation based on the years of service. o Legal and Capital reserve The legal reserve is a statutory reserve required by the regulators. The Bank has to keep aside annually 25 of its annual net proﬁt until such reserve equals its capital. When the legal reserve equals the capital of the Bank, the amount to be transferred to the legal reserve shall be 10 of the annual net proﬁt. The CBE South Sudan LTD has to transfer a ﬁxed value of 25 of its paid up capital to the Bank of South Sudan. This reserve is non-interest earning. p Income and expense recognition Interest income and expense are recognized in proﬁt or loss using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the ﬁnancial instrument to the gross carrying amount of the ﬁnancial assets or the amortized cost of the ﬁnancial liability. q Revenue and expense recognition When calculating the effective interest rate for ﬁnancial instruments other than credit-impaired assets, the Group estimates future cash ﬂows considering all contractual terms of the ﬁnancial instrument, but not future credit losses. For credit impaired ﬁnancial assets, a credit adjusted effective interest rate is calculating using estimated future cash ﬂows including incurred credit losses. The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transactions costs, fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incre- mental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a ﬁnancial asset or ﬁnancial liability. Amortized cost and gross carrying amount The amortized cost of a ﬁnancial asset or ﬁnancial liability is the amount at which the ﬁnancial asset or ﬁnancial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between the initial amount and the maturity amount and, for ﬁnancial assets, adjusted for any incurred credit loss allowance. v. Termination beneﬁts COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 201617 41 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued q Revenue and expense recognition Continued The gross carrying amount of a ﬁnancial asset is the amortized cost of a ﬁnancial asset before adjust- ing for any incurred credit loss. Calculation of interest income and expenses In calculating interest income and expenses, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset when the asset is not credit-impaired or to the amortized cost of the liability. However, for ﬁnancial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the ﬁnancial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis. For ﬁnancial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the asset. The calculation of interest income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves. q Fees and commissions Fees and commission income and expense that are integral to the effective interest rate on a ﬁnancial asset or ﬁnancial liability are included in the measurement of the effective interest rate. Other fees and commission income relate mainly to commissions on local money transfers LMTS, guarantee commission, outward remittance, card charges, and commission on import letter of credit- are recognized as the related services are performed. Other fees and commission expense relate mainly to transaction and service fees, which are expensed as the services are received. r Dividend income Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive income is established. Dividends are presented in net trading income, net income from other ﬁnancial instruments at fair value through proﬁt or loss or other revenue based on the underlying classiﬁcation of the equity investment s Income tax Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognized in proﬁt or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity or in OCI. a Current tax The current income tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable is the best estimate of tax amount expected to be paid that reﬂects the uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 42 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued s Income tax Continued b Deferred tax Deferred tax is measured under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabili- ties are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between such values. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to temporary differences when recovered or settled in each of the jurisdictions where the subsidiaries of the Bank operate, based on laws enacted or sub- stantially enacted as of the reporting date. No deferred taxes are recognized for the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and to the same ﬁscal entity or on different tax entities, the intent is to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁts will be available against which such can be reversed. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax beneﬁt will be realized. t Contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount thereof can be reasonably estimated. When a reasonable estimation cannot be made, disclosure is provided in the notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Contingent revenues, earnings or assets are not recognized until realization is assured. u New standards, amendments and interpretations i New and amended standards in issue but not yet effectiveduring the period ended 30 June 2017 The following new standards and amendments are in issue but are not yet effective during the year ended 30 June 2017, including consequential amendments to other standards with the date of initial application by the Group being 1 July 2017.

The International Accounting Standards Board IASB requires that the following changes in liabilities arising from ﬁnancing activities are disclosed to the extent necessary i changes from ﬁnancing cash ﬂows ii changes arising from obtaining or losing control of subsidiaries or other businesses iii the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates iv changes in fair values and v other changes. The IASB deﬁnes liabilities arising from ﬁnancing activities as liabilities "for which cash ﬂows were, or future cash ﬂows will be, classiﬁed in the statement of cash ﬂows as cash ﬂows from ﬁnancing activities". It also stresses that the new disclosure requirements also relate to changes in ﬁnancial assets if they meet the same deﬁnition. The amendments state that one way to fulﬁl the new disclosure requirement is to provide reconciliation between the opening and closing balances in the statement of ﬁnancial position for liabilities arising from ﬁnancing activities. Finally, the amendments state that changes in liabilities arising from ﬁnancing activities must be disclosed separately from changes in other assets and liabilities. The amendments apply for annual periods beginning on or after 1July 2017 and early applications are permitted. The amendments in Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses clarify the following aspects - Unrealised losses on debt instruments measured at fair value and measured at cost for tax purposes give rise to a deductible temporary difference regardless of whether the debt instrument's holder expects to recover the carrying amount of thedebt instrument by sale or by use. - The carrying amount of an asset does not limit the estimation of probable future taxable proﬁts. - Estimates for future taxable proﬁts exclude tax deductions resulting from the reversal of deductible temporary differences. - An entity assesses a deferred tax asset in combination with other deferred tax assets. Where tax law restricts the utilization of tax losses, an entity would assess a deferred tax asset in combination with other deferred tax assets of the same type.

IFRIC Interpretation 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration This Interpretation stipulates that the date of the transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income or part of it is the date on which an entity initially recognizes the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration. This Interpretation does not apply to income taxes, insurance contracts and circumstances when an entity measures the related asset, expense or income on initial recognitiona at fair value orb at the fair value of the consideration paid or received at a date other than the date of initial recognition of the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from advance consideration for example, the measurement of goodwill applying IFRS 3 Business Combinations.

IFRIC 23 explains how to recognise and measure deferred and current income tax assets and liabili- ties where there is uncertainty over a tax treatment. An uncertain tax treatment is any tax treatment applied by an entity where there is uncertainty over whether that treatment will be accepted by the tax authority. If an entity concludes that it is probable that the tax authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment that has been taken or is expected to be taken on a tax return, it should determine its accounting for income taxes consistently with that tax treatment. If an entity concludes that it is not probable that the treatment will be accepted, it should reﬂect the effect of the uncertainty in its income tax accounting in the period in which that determination is made. Uncertainty is reﬂected in the overall measurement of tax and separate provision is not allowed. The entity is required to measure the impact of the uncertainty using the method that best predicts the resolution of the uncertainty that is, the entity should use either the most likely amount method or the expected value method when measuring an uncertainty. The entity will also need to provide disclosures, under existing disclosure requirements, about a judgments made b assumptions and other estimates used and c Potential impact of uncertainties not reﬂected.

Where the assets transferred do not meet the deﬁnition of a business, a partial gain to the extent of unrelated investors' interests in the associate or Company is recognised. The deﬁnition of a business is key to determining the extent of the gain to be recognised. The effective date for these changes has now been postponed until the completion of a broader review.Based on the assessment of the Bank, the adoption of these changes will have insigniﬁcant impact on the amounts and disclosures of the Group's ﬁnancial statements. 5. FINANCIAL RISK REVIEW The Group is exposed to the following ﬁnancial risks from ﬁnancial instruments, for which it conducts regular risk management efforts - Credit risk - Liquidity risk - Market risk - Capital management - Operational Risk This note presents information about the BankGroup's exposure to each of the above risks, the Bank's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk. Further Bank's quanti- tative disclosures are included throughout separateconsolidated ﬁnancial statements. Risk management framework According to the Loan and Risk Review Committee Charter, the Board of Directors of the Bank, gives the minimum parameters to be followed by each institution's management in managing risks. The Loan and Risk Review Committee LRRC is in charge of spearheading and overseeing the risk man- agement standards at each entity. The management of each entity of the CBE group is responsible for developing and monitoring risk management policies of the Group. 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued The amendments apply for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early adoption is permitted. COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 48 5 Financial Risk Review continued Risk management framework Continued In line with the regulatory provision of the jurisdiction in which the subsidiaries operate and consis- tent with the nature of complexities and nature of the business activity, respective risk manage- ment committees of the subsidiaries are authorized and responsible to develop and monitor risk management policies, communicate the risk exposure and related results of risk management programs to the management regularly on an annual basis and whenever it is required. The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to those limits. The risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reﬂect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities. The Group's administration through its training in man- agement standards and procedures aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all the employees understand their roles and obligations. The Board Audit Committee of the Bank oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk manage- ment framework in relation to the risk faced by the Group. The Group's Board Audit Committee is assisted by the Internal Audit function. Internal Audit undertakes reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Group's Audit Committee. Additionally, the Bank is subject to the regulations of the National Bank of Ethiopia. Its subsidiaries, depending on the countries where they operate, are subject to the regulations of the Ministry of Trade, the Ethiopian Revenue and Customs Authority and Central Bank of South Sudan, with respect to, among other matters, comprehensive risk management, liquidity and capitalization. a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of ﬁnancial loss to the Bank if a customer or counterparty to a ﬁnancial instru- ment fails to meet its contractual obligations, in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed upon at the time the institution originated or acquired ﬁnancial asset. Each institution structures the acceptable credit risk levels it undertakes by establishing limits on the amount of risk accepted in relation to single borrower, groups of borrowers, product, term of the ﬁnancial instrument, and economic sectors. National Bank of Ethiopia NBE sets credit risk limits on a single borrower, one related party and all related parties not to exceed 25, 15 and 35 of Bank's total capital amount during the reporting period. Exposure to credit risk is managed through periodic analysis of the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to determine their capacity to meet principal and interest thereon, and restructuring such limits, as appropriate. Exposure to credit risk is also mitigated, in part, by obtaining collateral, commercial and personal guarantees. Credit management is conducted under policies deﬁned by each of the group entities administra- tions, in compliance with the guidelines set forth by the Board of directors and the Risk Management Committees. Such policies are reviewed and modiﬁed periodically based on changes and expectations of the markets where the Group entities operate, regulations, and other factors.

COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 50 5 Financial Risk Review continued Credit risk Continued The risk grades are described as follows Grade 1 This represents loans debtors labeled as "exceptionally low risk" borrowers. These loan debtors are characterized by the following criteria during the issuance of the credit risk grade - Loans and advances fully secured by cash and cash substitute, regardles of the loan status. - The borrower has a strong repayment capacity, excellent track record in servicing debt regularly, and does not demonstrate any reasons for doubting their repayment of capital and interest thereon on the agreed-upon dates. Grade2 This grade represents loan debtors labeled as "very low risk" borrowers. These loan debtors are characterized by the following criteria during the issuance of the credit risk grade - The borrower is not as strong as grade 1 in terms of credit risk parameters but has strong repayment capacity, excellent liquidity and low leverage. - The borrower has a well-established and a strong market share and demonstrates strong earnings and cash ﬂows. - The Bank has conﬁdence in the management of the business and - The loan is performing in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.

The borrower has adequate liquidity, cash ﬂow and earnings. The borrower has acceptable share in the market and an acceptable management capability. The loan is performing in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract. Grade 4 These borrowers are rated as "moderate risk" borrowers being capable of meeting the following criteria - They are not as strong as Grade 3 in terms of credit risk parameters. - The loans and advances show signs of irregularity, or have arrears. - The borrower needs attention due to conditions affecting the business, the industry, or the economic environment. - The borrower has above average risk due to strained liquidity, higher than normal leverage, thin cash ﬂow andor inconsistent earnings. - The borrower may incur a loss. - The borrower may incur a loss. - The borrower has above average risk due to strained liquidity, higher than normal leverage, thin cash ﬂow and or inconsistent earnings.

Grade6 These are "High risk" borrowers. - Financial condition is weak and capacity or inclination to repay is in doubt. - These weaknesses jeopardized full settlement of credit facilities. Grade7 "Very High" risk borrowers - Full repayment of principal and interest is unlikely and the possibility of loss is extremely high. - However, due to especially identiﬁable pending factors, such as litigation, liquidation procedures and capital injection, the asset is not yet classiﬁed as loss. Grade 8 "Default Risk" - The loan has been long outstanding with no progress in obtaining repayment or on the verge of liquidationwind up. - Prospect of recovery is poor and legal options have been pursued or initiated - Proceeds expected from the liquidation or realization of security may be awaited - The Bank's criteria for timely write-off shall apply. In order to classify the outstanding loans according to the risk grade of debtors, the following assumptions are used because of the fact that retail loans are not regularly graded except at the initial stage of the credit assessment. Loans disbursed to Business, Corporate and Commercial customers are presented according to their risk grade from the risk grading analysis. Emergency staff loan, staff personal loan and staff mortgage loan are assigned grade I because of the fact that such loans are regularly repaid from salary account of the staff without any delin- quency and arrears. All loans and advances that are unrated are assumed to be graded as follows. - All ungraded Pass status retail loans are assigned grade 2. - All ungraded Special Mention status retail loans are assigned risk grade 3 - All ungraded Sub-Standard status retail loans are assigned risk grade 5 - All ungraded Doubtful status retail loans are assigned risk grade 6. - All ungraded Loss status retail loans are assigned risk grade 7. - All loans and advances under litigation decision ALD are assigned risk grade 8.

As of 30 June 2017 and 30 June2016, the Bank's debt securities are not impaired. The loan portfolio is assessed collectively for impairment based on similar characteristics, basically the economic sector. Individually signiﬁcant loans are those above 5 of the paid up capital as of the reporting period. According to the NBE's directive No. SBB432008, non-performing defaulted loans refer to loans Default but not impaired loans or advances whose credit quality has deterio rated such that full collection of principal andor interest in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions is in question. Loans with pre-established repayment program are non- performing impaired when principal andor interest is due or uncollected for 90 consecutive days or more. Overdrafts and other advances that do not have pre-established repayment programs are non-performing defaulted when -The debt exceeds the borrower's approved limit for 90 consecutive days or more. -Interest is due and uncollected for 90 consecutive days or more. -For overdrafts, The account has been inactive for 90 consecutive days or more or Deposits are insufﬁcient to cover the interest capitalized during 90 consecutive days or The account fails to show debit balance of 5 or less from the approved limit at least once over 360 days preceding the date of loan review -While managing credit risk, default is considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when either or both of the following two events have occurred. Loans secured by cash or cash substitute guarantees andor sources of payment that are enough to cover the carrying value are deemed default but not impaired, that means, with no losses incurred. RestructuredRenegotiated loans Renegotiated loans or advances refers to loans which have been reﬁnanced, rescheduled, rolled over, or otherwise modiﬁed at favorable terms and conditions for the borrower because of weaknesses in the borrower's ﬁnancial condition or ability to repay. Non-Performing Loans are restructured when the result of analysis on the obligor's ﬁnancial capacity witnesses the need to modifychange the original terms and conditions of the loan contract in order to recover the outstanding loan. As per CBE's problem loans management procedure, any NPL defaulted loan is worked out and restructured by taking either of the following changes or combined options. COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 54 5 Financial Risk Review continued a Credit risk Continued -Extension of the repayment period with the consent of the concerned partiesborrower and guar antor -Changing the form of the loan fully or partially e.g. overdraft to a term loan -Requesting additional collateral or change of collateral -Cross-collateralizing multiple loans -Including additional covenants -Arranging transfer of loans from one borrower to other borrowers upon request bythe borrower, based on the mutual agreement of both the borrower and the would-be buyer of the loan, when an acceptable agreement is submitted to the Group and a new buyer of the loan is deemed to be better than the actual customer -Persuading owners, shareholders, and directorsmanagers of borrowers to enter into a personal guarantee contract with the Group -The Group does not encourage additional ﬁnance for the loan recovery cases. However, the Group may approve additional loan for Grade 6 and 7 customers, if there are appropriate and concrete justiﬁable reasons and An existing loan whose terms have been modiﬁed may be derecognized and the renegotiated loan recognized as a new loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy and as such does not remain in the same category of loan status as prior to restructuring. However, the status category is turned to "substandard", without prejudice to the standard deﬁnition of substandard when a Renegotiated term loans equivalent of all past due interest is paid by the borrower in cash at the time of renegotiation and the following payments are made by the borrower on a consistent and timely basis in accordance with the restructured terms of the loan or advance. - Loans with monthly or quarterly installment payments, at least 3threeconsecutive repayments. - Loans with semi-annual installment repayments, at least 2two installments. - Loans with annual installment repayments, at least one repayment. b Renegotiated non-performing overdraft facilities equivalent of all past due interest is paid by the borrower in cash at the time of renegotiation and the account shows at a minimum - A nil balance at least once - A turnover rate of once the approved limit Allowance for loan losses impairment The Group created an allowance which represents its best estimate of incurred losseson its loan portfolio. The main components of this allowance are a collective loan losses allowance established by groups with homogeneous characteristics as well as individual credit exposures that were subject to individual impairment assessment, but were not impaired. Credit exposures subject to individual impairment assessment are those considered as individually signiﬁcant. CBE considers a loan to be signiﬁcant individual when a single loan or the total of loans outstanding to a single counterparty are above 5 of CBE's paid up capital as of the reporting period. The Group determines the write-off of a loan or group of loans demonstrating non recoverability. Write-off policy This determination is made after performing an analysis of the ﬁnancial conditions from the date of default and the likelihood of recovering such loans.

There is no speciﬁed time limit for defaulted loans to be written off, they are written-off immediately after exhausting all means to recover the loan. After having fully exhausted all possible means for the recovery of loans and advances and after ascertaining that the property held as collateral including properties from the solidary creditors does not cover the loan in full as well as having ascertaining that there is no other attachable property to cover the remaining balance fully or partially, the recovery unit compiles evidence to support that the loan or part of it be written-off as unrecoverable.

The equivalent rating is used to aggregate the overall rating by these agencies. Collateral The Bank has guarantees for loans granted, mainly Government bonds and written governrnent undertakings by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Cooperation, Motor Vehicles, Buildings and other classes of collaterals. Fair value estimates are based on the value of guarantees at the time loan commitments originate. The Group has technical employees appraisers for a constant monitoring of these collaterals in order to update such fair values if it is necessary. In addition, the fair value of collateral is updated when a loan is individually assessed as impaired or by any change in conditions that the debtor requests in advance and in the case of project ﬁnancing, according to the progress of work. While estimating the value of the collateral held, the Group Bank may opt to use the cost, sales comparison or income valuation approach as appropriate. Every collateralized property is insured by an appropriate insurance company with the insurance policy providing 100 coverage against perils related to the property.

COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 60 b Liquidity risk 5 Financial Risk Review continued 2017 2016 150,250,212,831 364,030,327,452 10.41 137,418,738,760 288,328,299,280 1 0.48 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group either does not have sufﬁcient liquid fund available to meet all its obligations and commitments as and when they fall due, or it can only acquire liquid ﬁnancial resources at excessive cost or realize its assets into cash at lower value and require relatively longer time. The Bank's approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it has an adequate liquid fund, stored liquidity and its ability to have access purchased liquidity from the market in order to meet its obligations when they are due. It assesses the ability honor maturing obligations and unexpected withdrawal demand under both normal and stressful situations, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to its reputation and security. The Group manages liquidity risk on both a short-term and a medium-term basis. In the short-term, the focus is on ensuring that the cash ﬂow demands can be met through asset maturities, customer deposits and wholesale funding where required. In the medium-term, the focus is on ensuring the statement of ﬁnancial position remains structurally sound. The Asset and Liability Management Committee ALCO and the Risk Management Committee regularly monitor the liquidity position by analyzing the maturity structure of assets and liabilities, the stability of deposits by customer type and the compliance to minimum standards set forth by the regulations and corporate policies. The key measure used by the Group for managing liquidity risk is the ratio of net liquid assets to deposits from customers. Net liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and negotiable ﬁnancial instruments that mature in less than 186 days from the date of issue. The Group monitors on a regular basis the advances to deposits ratio. This is deﬁned as the ratio of total loans and advances to customers relative to total customer deposits. A low advances to deposit ratio demonstrates that customer deposits are in excess of customer loans due to the emphasis placed on generating a high level of stable funding from customers.

Customer deposits that mature within three months represent current, savings and call deposit account balances, which past experience has shown to be stable and of a long-term nature. Liquidity risk arises in the general funding of the Group's activities and in the management of positions. It includes both the risk of being unable to fund assets at appropriate maturities and rates, and the risk of being unable to liquidate an asset at a reasonable price and in an appropriate time frame. The Group has access to a diverse funding base. Funds are raised using a broad range of instruments including deposits and other liabilities. This enhances ﬂexibility, limits dependence on any source of funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. The Group strives to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and ﬂexibility through the use of liabilities with a range of maturities. The Group continually assesses liquidity risk by identifying and monitoring changes in funding required to meet business goals and targets set in terms of the overall Group strategy. c Market risk The Group recognizes market risk as the risk of loss arising from changes in market prices and rates. The Group's exposure to market risk arises principally from customer-driven transactions and recognizes that the value of on and off-balance sheet positions of the Group are adversely affected by the movement in the market prices or rates such as interest rate, exchange rate, equity prices and commodity prices that may result in loss for the Group. The objective of the Group's market risk policies and processes is to obtain the best balance between risk and return whilst meeting customers' requirements. The Group's exposure to potential market risk arises mainly due to the open interest rate and exchange rate positions. All these elements are exposed to general and speciﬁc market movements and may result in the reduction of the value of a ﬁnancial asset. The Asset and Liability Management Committee ALCO authorizes the established limits and monitor results. a Interest rate risk The interest rate risk is the exposure of the ﬁnancial position of the Group to any losses arising from adverse movements in interest rates. The Group monitors the sensitivity of changes in interest rates, and determines the balance structure, different item terms and investment strategies. The table below summarizes the exposure to interest rate risk. Included in the table below are the Group's assets and liabilities at carrying amounts, categorized by the earlier of contractual re-pricing or maturity dates.

The stress test analysis is based on projected movements of Birr against the US dollar since more than 95 of the Group's foreign currency assets and liabilities are denominated in dollars. On average, the US dollar has appreciated at a rate of 5 against Birr every year during the previous periods. For the stress testing, 5 appreciation of the dollar against ETB has been taken in anticipation of the trend continuing.

The Group seeks to ensure that key operational risks are managed in a timely and effective manner through a framework of policies, procedures and tools to identify, assess, monitor, control and report such risks. Total decrease increase from major Currencies COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 68 d Operational risk management continued Operational risks arise from all of the Group's operations and are faced by all business units. As such, the Group seeks to ensure that key operational risks are managed in a timely and effective manner through a framework of policies, procedures and tools to identify, assess, control and report such risks. The scope of operational risk assessment of any process shall be determined based on vari- ous factors, among them - The level of perceived risks - Previous operational risk assessment risks - Business criticality of the activities, process or product under consideration - The presence of overarching regulatory requirements and - Management's need for further examination of ongoing operations such as lines of business,product, service and processes individually or in combinations. Every risk assessment unit shall perform a risk assessment on its respective processesunits, at least on an annual basis. The Risk and Compliance Management process may request for more frequent risk assessment, if the need arises, primarily based on the perceived level of risk of the respective risk assessment unitprocess. e Capital management The statutory regulator, the National Bank of Ethiopia, has issued directive number SBB495 that dictates that every bank transfers on an annual basis, 25 of its annual net proﬁt to its legal reserve account until such account equals its capital. When the legal reserve account equals the Group's capital, the amount to be transferred to the legal reserve account shall be 10 of the annual net proﬁt. The Group's capital is therefore managed in accordance with NBE directives and proclamation on banking business and those of subsidiaries capital is managed in accordance with other related laws. 5 Financial Risk Review continued The National Bank of Ethiopia requires a bank to maintain at all times - Primary or Tier 1 capital state capitalpaid-up capital, declared reserves and Accumulated Proﬁt or loss. - Secondary or Tier 2 capital Includes qualiﬁed equity instruments. However, CBE does not have any tier-2 capital accounts in its statement of ﬁnancial position. In addition to regulatory requirements, CBE conducts objective analysis on the adequacy of its capitalization on a regular basis. Based on the result of rigorous analysis made on capital management and adequacy, CBE injects additional capital after proposing the required amount of additional capital to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Cooperation and upon approval by the House of Peoples' Representatives of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.

Accounting classiﬁcations continued Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal market or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reﬂects its non-performance risk. When applicable, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufﬁcient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. When there is no quoted price in an active market, the Group uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. The following sets out the Group's basis of establishing fair values of ﬁnancial instrumentsDebt securities with observable market prices including equity securities are fair valued using that information. Debt securities that do not have observable market data are fair valued using the discounted cash ﬂow method or quoted market prices for securities with similar yield characteristics. During the current year, there was sufﬁcient information available to measure the fair value ofﬁnancial instruments based on observable market inputs. In the previous year, the available-for-sale equity instruments were measured at cost because the fair value was not considered to be reliably measurable. Loans and advances to customers and Loans to micro-ﬁnance institutions are net of allowance for impairment. The estimated fair value of loans and advances represents the discounted amount of future cash ﬂows expected to be received. Expected cash ﬂows are discounted at current market rates to determine fair value hence their fair values approximate their carrying amounts. The estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is the amount repayable on demand. Estimated fair value of ﬁxed interest bearing deposits without quoted market prices is based on discounting cash ﬂows using the prevailing market rates for debts with similar maturities and interest rates hence their fair value approximates their carrying amounts.

Further Bank's quanti- tative disclosures are included throughout separate ﬁnancial statements. The Board of Directors of the Bank has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Bank's risk management framework. The Board has established the Loan and Risk Review Committee LRRC through the Loan and Risk Review Committee charter, which is responsible for providing the standards and minimum parameters to be followed in managing the bank's exposure to risk. Besides, it is also responsible for developing and monitoring effectiveness of the Bank's risk management policies and the degree of compliance to national and international regulatory standards. The LRRC reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities. The Banks risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Bank, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to those limits. The risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reﬂect changes in market conditions and the Bank's activities. The Bank through its training management standards and procedures aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all the employees understand their roles and obligations. The Bank's Board Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Bank's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk manage- ment framework in relation to the risk faced by the Bank. The Bank's Board Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by the Internal Audit function. Internal Audit undertakes reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Bank's Audit Committee. In addition, the Bank is subject to the regulations of the National Bank of Ethiopia with respect to, among others matters, comprehensive risk management, liquidity and capitalization.

Credit Risk Refer page No. 49-59 b. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank either does not have sufﬁcient resources available to meet all its obligations and commitments as and when they fall due, or can only access these ﬁnancial resources at excessive cost. The Bank's approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufﬁcient liquidity to meet its liabili- ties when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Bank's reputation and security. The Bank manages liquidity risk on both short-term and medium-term bases. 1n the short-term, the focus is on ensuring that the cash ﬂow demands can be met through asset maturities, customer deposits and wholesale funding where required. 1n the medi- um-term, the focus is on ensuring the statement of ﬁnancial position remains structurally sound. The Asset and Liability Management Committee ALCO and the Risk Management Com- mittee regularly monitor the liquidity position by analyzing the maturity structure of assets and liabilities, the stability of deposits by customer type and the compliance to minimum standards set forth by the regulations and corporate policies. The key measure used by the Bank for managing liquidity risk is the ratio of net liquid assets to deposits from customers. Net liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and negotiable ﬁnancial instruments that mature in less than 186 days from the date of issue. The Bank also monitors on a regular basis the advances to deposits ratio. This is deﬁned as the ratio of total loans and advances to customers relative to total customer deposits. A low advances to deposit ratio demonstrates that customer deposits are in excess of customer loans due to the emphasis placed on generating a high level of stable funding from custom- ers.

Liquidity risk continued Cash and balances with NBE Investment in subsidiaries and associates Annual Report 201617 105 28 Financial risk review continued b. Liquidity risk continued It is assumed that the fair value of the liquid assets is equivalent to the carrying amount since no discounting is involved to realize these assets into cash. Customer deposits that mature within three months represent current, savings and call deposit account balances, which past experience has shown to be stable and of a long-term nature. Liquidity risk arises in the general funding of the Bank's activities and in the management of positions. It includes both the risk of being unable to fund assets at appropriate maturities and rates, and the risk of being unable to liquidate an asset at a reasonable price and in an appro - priate time frame. The Bank has access to a diverse funding base. Funds are raised using a broad range of instru - ments including deposits and other liabilities. This enhances ﬂexibility, limits dependence on any source of funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. The Bank strives to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and ﬂexibility through the use of liabilities with a range of maturities. The Bank continually assesses liquidity risk by identifying and monitoring changes in funding required meeting business goals and targets set in terms of the overall Bank strategy. c. Market risk The Bank recognizes market risk as the risk of loss arising from changes in market prices and rates. The Bank's exposure to market risk arises principally from customer-driven transactions and recognizes that the value of on and off-balance sheet positions of the bank are adversely affected by the movement in the market prices or rates such as interest rate, exchange rate, equity prices and commodity prices that may result in loss for the Bank. The objective of the Bank's market risk policies and processes is to obtain the best balance between risk and return whilst meeting customers' requirements. The Bank's exposure to potential market risk arises mainly due to the open interest rate and exchange rate positions. All these elements are exposed to general and speciﬁc market movements and may result in the reduction of the value of a ﬁnancial asset. The Asset and Liability Management Committee ALCO authorizes the established limits and monitor results. a Interest rate risk The interest rate risk is the exposure of the ﬁnancial position of the Bank to any losses arising from adverse movements in interest rates. The Bank monitors the sensitivity of changes in interest rates, and determines the balance structure, different item terms and investment strategies. The table below summarizes the exposure to interest rate risk. Included in the table below are the Bank's assets and liabilities at carrying amounts, categorized by the earlier of contractual re-pricing or maturity dates.

Market risk continued b Exchange rate risk Exchange rate risk is the risk a ﬁnancial instrument's value ﬂuctuates as a result of changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies and other ﬁnancial variables. Foreign exchange rate risk arises from ﬁnancial instruments denominated in currencies other than the Bank's functional currency. The Bank's foreign currency denominated assets and liability accounts may result in translation gainloss depending on the net open position and direction of the exchange rate movement. To control the risk, the net position in each foreign currency is managed on a daily basis.

The stress test analysis is based on projected movements of Birr against the US dollar since more than 95 of the Bank's foreign currency assets and liabilities are denominated in dollars. On average, the US dollar has appreciated at a rate of 5 against Birr every year during the previous periods. At 30 June 2017 if the Birr had weakened by 5 against the major trading currencies, with all other variables held constant, net proﬁt would have decreased by ETB 4,942,050,952 2016 ETB 8,608,066,322 while a strengthening by 5 would have resulted in an increase in proﬁt by ETB 5,462,266,842 2016 ETB 9,226,536,796. COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 201617 109 28 FINANCIAL RISK REVIEW Continued d. Operational risk management Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss arising from a wide variety of causes associated with the Bank's processes, personnel, technology and infrastructure and from external factors other than credit, market and liquidity risks such as those arising from legal and regulatory requirements and generally accepted standards of corporate behavior. The Bank seeks to ensure that key operational risks are managed in a timely and effective manner through a framework of policies, procedures and tools to identify, assess, monitor, control and report such risks. Operational risks arise from all of the Bank's operations and are faced by all business units. As such, the Bank seeks to ensure that key operational risks are managed in a timely and effective manner through a framework of policies, procedures and tools to identify, assess, control and report such risks. The scope of operational risk assessment of any process is determined based on various factors, among them The level of perceived risks Previous operational risk assessment risks Business criticality of the activities, process or product under consideration The presence of overarching regulatory requirements and Management's need for further examination of ongoing operations such as lines of business, product, service and processes individually or in combinations. Every risk assessment unit shall perform a risk assessment on its respective processesunits, at least on an annual basis. The Risk and Compliance Management process may request for more frequent risk assessment, if the need arises, primarily based on the perceived level of risk of the respective risk assessment unitprocess. e. Capital management The Bank manages its capital based on Basel guidelines as well as local regulation requirements. The statutory regulator, the National Bank of Ethiopia, has issued directive number SBB495 that dictates every bank transfer on an annual basis, 25 of its annual net proﬁt to its legal reserve account until such account equals its capital. When the legal reserve account equals the Bank's capital, the amount to be transferred to the legal reserve account shall be 10 of the annual net proﬁt. The Bank's capital is therefore managed in accordance with NBE directives and proclamation on banking business and those of subsidiaries capital is managed in accordance with other related laws. In addition to regulatory requirements, CBE conducts objective analysis on the adequacy of its capitalization on a regular basis. Based on the result of rigorous analysis made on capital management and adequacy, CBE injects additional capital after proposing the required amount of additional capital to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Cooperation and upon approval by the House of Peoples' Representatives of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.

Accounting classiﬁcations continued Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal market or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Bank has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reﬂects its non-performance risk. When applicable, the Bank measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufﬁcient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. When there is no quoted price in an active market, the Bank uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. The following sets out the Bank's basis of establishing fair values of ﬁnancial instruments Debt securities with observable market prices including equity securities are fair valued using that information. Debt securities that do not have observable market data are fair valued using the discounted cash ﬂow method or quoted market prices for securities with similar yield characteristics. During the current year, there was sufﬁcient information available to measure the fair value of ﬁnancial instruments based on observable market inputs. In the previous year, the available forsale equity instruments were measured at cost because the fair value was not considered to be reliably measurable. Loans and advances to customers and Loans to micro-ﬁnance institutions are net of allowance for impairment. The estimated fair value of loans and advances represents the discounted amount of future cash ﬂows expected to be received. Expected cash ﬂows are discounted at current market rates to determine fair value hence their fair values approximate their carrying amounts. The estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is the amount repayable on demand. Estimated fair value of ﬁxed interest bearing deposits without quoted market prices is based on discounting cash ﬂows using the prevailing market rates for debts with similar maturities and interest rates hence their fair value approximates their carrying amounts.
