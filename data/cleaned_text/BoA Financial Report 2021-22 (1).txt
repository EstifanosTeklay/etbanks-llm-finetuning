The past year was a challenging time for the global economy when it experienced contraction after a brief recovery, owing to several shocks that hit it. The global economic activity already weakened by the pandemic, faced a higher-than-expected inflation worldwide - especially in the United States and European economies-triggering tighter financial conditions, and negative spillovers from the war in Ukraine IMF WEO update, July 2022. With increasing prices continuing to compress living standards worldwide, tighter monetary policy stances ensued which has real economic costs. High energy and food prices compounded by persistent supply chain disruptions are believed to have reduced the global economic growth to 3.2 in 2022 from 6.1 in 2021 IMF July 2022. 8 On the domestic front, the Ethiopian economy which has been working out of the effects of the pandemic was affected by continued socioeconomic and security challenges. The challenges to the economic activities remained the persistent foreign exchange shortage, high inflation, drought incidents, and internal conflicts. Noticeably, the inflationary pressure remained high suggesting increased cost of living and doing business, and contracted savings. Despite these combined challenges, the Ethiopian economy managed to register positive economic growth. In the financial regulatory environment, several policy changes were made by the National Bank of Ethiopia during the Fiscal Year, in a bid to put in place prudential regulation and monetary management, such as amendments to deposit reserve requirement and foreign currency utilization which had phenomenal repercussion on banks operational performance and profitability. It was a commendable performance that the Bank of Abyssinia registered in asset growth and profitability under such tight macroeconomic conditions.The Bank of Abyssinia continued to build upon its past accomplishments through better services and accessibility.

During the year, we have accomplished a lot in financial and operational areas, despite the wide -ranging shortfalls in the overall operating environment. The year 202122 has witnessed a number of challenges by the global economy which tended to reverse the gains attained from the recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic. The global economy was subjected to multiple shocks from the scarring of the pandemic to war in Ukraine which has worsened overall activities, as a result of which, according to IMFs July 2022 update, growth is anticipated to go lower than 3.2 for 2022 from an estimated 6.1 in 2021. Global inflation has gone higher than anticipated and broadening beyond food and energy prices, which, thereby prompted major central banks to announce further monetary tightening measures with ample weigh on the recovery. The domestic economy has remained largely resilient after having passed through a range of challenges that include the lack of security and war in the northern part of the country, intensifying Foreign Exchange shortages, drought and flood incidents, and spillovers from the war in Ukraine. This situation 12 BANK OF ABYSSINIA ANNUAL REPORT 202122 has exacerbated with rising general price level that weakened socioeconomic activities. In the year under review, the banking industry has been operating under tough conditions mainly due to political instability and civil unrests in some parts of the country, and reduced business activities due to the negative impact of the pandemic which rendered businesses slow pace to bounce back. Against such challenging background, Bank of Abyssinia has achieved growth in assets and earnings. With the unrelenting and focused efforts in effectively implementing business strategies, the Bank registered significant growth in profitability as the profit before tax grew to ETB 4.65 billion this year from Birr 2.05 billion last year, up by Birr 2.6 billion or by 127. Furthermore, the Bank has seen an incremental deposit growth of Birr 33.16 billion, while the total deposit reached Birr 122.05 billion. The total outstanding loans and advances amount Principal plus interest reached Birr 113.33 billion, showing a 48 increase over that of the preceding year balance. The total assets of the Bank has significantly increased to Birr 149.5 billion in the year just ended from Birr 104.05 billion last year, representing a 44 increment, that is, an increase of Birr 45.4 billion. During the Fiscal Year, the Bank has invested intensive time and resources on the expansion of accessibility through modern technology and digital channels, in addition to opening of strategically located branch outlets. The Bank has opened 125 additional service outlets during the year and the total number of service outlets has reached 748. Moreover, the Banks virtual banking centers reached 16 with an additional 11 centers launched during the reporting period. The Banks customer base overall as well as on its digital banking platform has attracted well over 7.5 million deposit account holders out of which Interest-Free Banking accounts comprised more than 1 million. There were 1.25 million card holders, 2.26 million mobile banking users while the number of internet banking users reached nearly 31,000. In line with its strategic aim of strengthening its digital capability, the Bank has continued investing resources in digital banking service expansion to satisfy the ever-changing customer needs and to exploit the available opportunities to the optimal level. The efforts have been increased over time and fruits of increasing digital capabilities are being observed in terms of an increased share of digital transactions while at the same time a safe and secure environment has been in the making as security enhancement works have ripened. The Bank kept on presenting new and innovative digital banking solutions to the domestic market. During the year under review, the Bank has been working on yet another new solution with unique features of self-service on mobile phones, the implementation of which should go in full vigor during the upcoming Fiscal Year. 13 Respected Shareholders, As successful as it was, this year has also featured ups and downs in the operating environment indicative of the challenges that the coming year holds for banks operating in the country, from uncertainty in the security situation to more competition coming from local and potentially foreign participants both in the form of bank operators and non-bank players. We anticipate opportunities so that we embrace the new Fiscal Year cognizant of such developments and with renewed commitment and dedication. By surfing through the environment dynamics through continued scanning, I am sure, as ever, that the Bank shall proactively devise and implement well-measured mechanisms to effectively match the developments and deliver its desired outcomes. To this end, the Bank keeps on pushing innovative products and banking solutions towards satisfying its customers, through cultivating a performance culture, and developing our employees, so that we ensure sustainable growth and profitability. By leveraging on the farsighted leadership from the Board of Directors, and with the strong commitment and dedication from the Executive Management and staff, I am confident that the Bank will see yet another set of high financial results and growth in the year ahead.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the fi nancial position of the Bank as at 30 June 2022, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and the requirements of the Commercial Code of Ethiopia of 2013 E.C. We have no comments to make on the report of the Board of Directors relating to the financial matters and pursuant to Article 349 1 and 2 of the Commercial Code of Ethiopia of 2013 E.C, and recom mend the above mentioned financial statements be approved. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing ISAs. Our responsi bilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Bank in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, and we have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these require ments. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Other Information The Directors are responsible for the other information, which comprises the report of the Board of Directors as required by the Commercial Code of Ethiopia 2013 E.C and A Proclamation to Provide for Banking Business No. 5922008 of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, and directives of the National Bank of Ethiopia. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other informa tion and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the finan cial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 34 If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, and then we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this re gard. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements The Management of the Bank are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, and the require ments of the Commercial Code of Ethiopian of 2013 E.C, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Banks ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concernbasis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Banks financial reporting process. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain profes sional scepticism throughout the audit. We also Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Banks internal control. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of account ing estimates and related disclosures made by management. Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Getachew Kassaye Simon Audit Partnership Formerly Getachew Kassay Co. Chartered Certified Accountants 35 Conclude on the appropriateness of managements use of the going concern basis of account ing and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Banks ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, then we are required to draw attention in our auditors report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the Bank or business activities within the Bank to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit. We remain solely respon sible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings including any significant deficiencies in in ternal control that we identify during our audit.

The management has no doubt that the Bank would remain the existence after 12 months. These financial statements were approved by the Board of directors on September 30, 2022. The man age ment has assessed the BoA ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment has been made having considered the impact of COVID-19 macroeconomic headwinds, including A review of the Strategy and Corporate Plan, both of which cover a year from the date of signing the annual report An assessment of the actual performance to date, loan book quality, credit impairment, legal, regulatory and compliance matters, and the updated annual budget Analysis of the capital position of the Company including the capital ratios, and the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment BoA has sufficient capital to continue as a going concern and meet minimum regulatory capital requirements An analysis of BoA liquidity position and whether sufficient liquidity resources are being maintained to meet liabilities as they fall due. Further, liquidity was considered in the context of the risk appetite metrics Based on the analysis performed, the directors confirm they are satisfied that BoA has adequate resources to continue in business for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements For this reason, BoA continues to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for preparing the finan cial Statements. 2.2.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures i New standards, amendments, interpretations effective and adopted during the year A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 July 2021 and earlier applications are permitted and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. 2.2.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures i New standards, amendments, interpretations effective and adopted during the year A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 July 2021 and earlier applications are permitted and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. Reference of the Conceptual Framework- Amendments to IFRS 3 1 Jan 2022 Property, Plant and Equipment Proceeds before Intended Use Amendments to IAS 16 1 Jan 2022 Onerous Contracts Costs of Fulfilling a Contract Amendments to IAS 37 1 Jan 2022 AIP IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards Subsidiary as a first-time adopter 1 Jan 2022 AIP IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Fees in the 10 per cent test for de-recognition of financial liabilities 1 Jan 2022 Reference to the Conceptual Framework Amendments to IFRS 3 The amendments add an exception to the recognition principle of IFRS 3 to avoid the issue of potential day 2 gains or losses arising for liabilities and contingent liabilities that would be within the scope of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets or IFRIC 21 Levies, if incurred separately. BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 42 Reference to the Conceptual Framework Amendments to IFRS 3 The amendments add an exception to the recognition principle of IFRS 3 to avoid the issue of potential day 2 gains or losses arising for liabilities and contingent liabilities that would be within the scope of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets or IFRIC 21 Levies, if incurred sepa rately. At the same time, the amendments add a new paragraph to IFRS 3 to clarify that contingent assets do not qualify for recognition at the acquisition date. These amendments have no material impact on BoA financial statements. Property, Plant and Equipment Proceeds before Intended Use Amendments to IAS 16 Effective in 2022, proceeds from the sale of items e.g. extracted minerals, test products before the re lated property, plant and equipment PPE is available for its intended use are no longer deducted from the cost of PPE. Instead, proceeds are recognized in profit or loss, together with the costs of producing those items. Accordingly, like US GAAP, companies will need to clearly distinguish between the costs of producing and selling items before the PPE is available for its intended use, and the costs of making the PPE available for its intended use. These amendments had no impact on BoA financial statements. Onerous Contracts Costs of Fulfilling a Contract Amendments to IAS 37 Under IFRS Standards, onerous contracts those in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the con tractual obligation outweigh the expected benefits must be identified and accounted for. The Inter national Accounting Standards Board recently revised IAS 371 to clarify which costs should be used to identify onerous contracts. As a result, from 2022 companies may need to recognize more and larger contract loss provisions. Even without the amendments, many revenue-generating or purchasing con tracts could become onerous due to COVID-19. AIP IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards Subsidiary as a first-time adopter The amendment permits a subsidiary that elects to apply paragraph D16a of IFRS 1 to measure cu mulative translation differences using the amounts reported in the parents consolidated financial state ments, based on the parents date of transition to IFRS, if no adjustments were made for consolidation procedures and for the effects of the business combination in which the parent acquired the subsidiary. This amendment is also applied to an associate or joint venture that elects to apply paragraph D16a of IFRS 1. An entity applies the amendment for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Earlier application is permitted. These amendments had no impact on BoA financial statements. Fees in the 10 per cent test for DE recognition of financial liabilities The amendment clarifies the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. These fees include only those paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the others behalf. There is no similar amendment BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 43 proposed for IAS 39. An entity applies the amendment to financial liabilities that are modified or exchanged on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the amendment. An entity applies the amendment for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Earlier application is permitted. BoA should assess this amendment in accordance to the IFRS guidance. ii. New Standards, amendments, interpretations issued but not yet effective. 2.3. Functional currency translation of foreign currency a Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Bank operates the functional currency. The functional currency and pre sentation currency of the Bank is the Ethiopian Birr Birr. b Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated intoBirr using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary items denominated in foreign currency are translated using the closing rate as at the reporting date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation of year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognized in the income statement. At the end of a reporting period non-monetary items carried at historical amounts continue to be mea sured using transaction-date exchange rates, monetary items are retranslated using the closing rate and non-monetary items carried at fair value are measured at valuation-date exchange rates. Impairment test Measure non-monetary assets at the lower of either Carrying amount multiply by historical rate. Net realizable valuerecoverable amount multiply by closing rate at the end of the period. Translation gains or losses on assetliability recognized in profit or loss. 2.4. Financial instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. 2.4.1 Financial assets 2.4.1.1 Initial recognition and measurement Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income OCI, and fair value through profit or loss. new or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. These fees include only those paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the others behalf. There is no similar amendment proposed for IAS 39. An entity applies the amendment to financial liabilities that are modified or exchanged on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the amendment. An entity applies the amendment for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Earlier application is permitted. BoA should assess this amendment in accordance to the IFRS guidance. ii. New Standards, amendments, interpretations issued but not yet effective. Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current - Amendments to IAS 1 1 Jan 2023 Definition of Accounting Estimates - Amendments to IAS 8 1 Jan 2023 Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 1 Jan 2023 Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction Amendments to IAS 12 1 Jan 2023 2.3. Functional currency translation of foreign currency BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 44 The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial assets contractual cash flow characteristics and the Banks business model for managing them. The Bank initially mea sures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or debt instruments at fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and inter est SPPI on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level. The Banks business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place regular way trades are recognized on the settlement date, i.e., the date that the Bank receives the asset on purchase or delivers the asset on sale. 2.4.1.2 Subsequent measurement For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories Financial assets at amortised cost debt instruments Financial assets at fair value through OCI with recycling of cumulative gains and Losses debt instruments Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no recycling of Cumulative gains and losses upon de-recognition equity instruments Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. i Financial assets at amortised cost debt instruments This category is the most relevant to the Bank. The Bank measures financial assets atamortised cost if both of the following conditions are metThe financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest EIR meth od and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is de-recognized, modified or impaired. ii Financial assets at fair value through OCI debt instruments The Bank measures debt instruments at fair value through OCI if both of the following conditions are met The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective of both holding to collect contrac tual cash flows and selling andthe contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 45 For debt instruments at fair value through OCI, interest income, foreign exchange revaluation and im pairment losses or reversals are recognized in profit or loss and computed in the same manner as for financial assets measured at amortised cost. The remaining fair value changes are recognized in OCI. Upon de-recognition, the cumulative fair value change recognized in OCI is recycled to profit or loss. iii Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI equity instruments Upon initial recognition, the Bank can elect to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity in struments designated at fair value through OCI when they meet the definition of equity under IAS 32 Financial Instruments Presentation and are not held for trading. The classification is determined on an instrument-by-instru ment basis. Gains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognized as other income in profit or loss when the right of payment has been es tablished, except when the Bank benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment assessment.The Bank elected to classify irrevocably its non-listed equity investments under this category as it intends to hold these investments for the foreseeable future. iv Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading, financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, or financial assets man datorily required to be measured at fair value. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest are classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of the business model. Not with standing the criteria for debt instruments to be classified at amortised cost or at fair value through OCI, as described above, debt instruments may be designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition if doing so eliminates, or significantly reduces, an accounting mismatch. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with net changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss. 2.4.1.3 Impairment of financial assets Overview of Expected Credit Loss ECL principles The Bank recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses ECL for financial assets that are debt instruments and are not measured at FVTPL. The Bank measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL except for the following for which they are measured as 12-month ECL BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 46 Fixed income securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other financial instruments for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. 2.4.2 Financial liabilities 2.4.2.1 Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. 2.4.2.2 Subsequent measurement The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below i Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial li abilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in profit or loss. Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in IFRS 9 are satisfied. The Bank has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit or loss. ii Loans and borrowings This is the category most relevant to the Bank. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the liabilities are de-recognized as well as through the EIR amortiza tion process. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included as finance costs in profit or loss. 2.4.3. Impairment i Restructured financial assets Where the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial assets is re placed with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then the Bank shall assess whether the financial asset should be derecognized and ECL are measured as follows If the expected restructuring will not result in de-recognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 47 If the expected restructuring will result in de-recognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is related as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its de-recognition.This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the exist ing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of de-recognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset. ii Credit-impaired financial assets At each reporting date, the Bank shall assess whether financial assets carried at amortized cost, debt financial assets carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit-impaired referred to as Stage 3 financial assets. A financial asset shall be considered credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data Significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer A breach of contract such as a default or past due event The restructuring of a loan or advance by the Bank of terms that the Bank would not consider otherwise It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganiza tion or The disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties. A loan that has been renegotiated due to deterioration in the borrowers condition shall be considered to be credit- impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more shall be considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different. iii Presentation of allowance for ECL in the statement of financial position Loss allowance for ECL shall be presented in the statement of financial position as follows For financial assets measured at amortized cost as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets For loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts generally, as a provision Where a financial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Bank cannot identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from those on the drawn component the Bank presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The combined amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn com ponent. Any excess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision and For debt instruments measured at FVOCI no loss allowance is recognized in the statement of financial position because the carrying amount of those assets is their fair value. However, the BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 48 loss allowance shall be disclosed and is recognized in the fair value reserve. iv Write-off Loans and debt securities shall be written off either partially or in full when there is no reasonable ex pectation of recovering the amount in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Bank determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-of. This assessment shall be carried out at the individual asset level. Recoveries of amounts previously written off shall be included in impairment losses on financial instru ments in the statement of profit or loss and OCI. Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Banks procedures for recovery of amounts due. v Non-integral financial guarantee contracts The Banks shall assess whether a financial guarantee contact held is an integral element of a financial asset that is accounted for as a component of that instrument or is a contract that is accounted for, separately. Where the Bank determines that the guarantee is an integral element of the financial asset, then any premium payable in connection with the initial recognition of the financial asset shall be treated as a transaction cost of acquiring it. The Bank shall consider the effect of the protection when measuring the fair value of the debit instru ment and when measuring ECL. Where the Bank determines that the guarantee is not an integral element of the debt instrument, then it shall recognize an asset representing any prepayment of guarantee premium and a right to compen sation for credit losses. 2.4.4. De-recognition i Financial Assets The Bank shall derecognize financial asset when The contractual right to the cash flows from the financial asset expires, or It transfers the right to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substan tially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. On de-recognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognized and the sum of i the consideration received including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed and ii any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in OCI shall be recognized in profit or loss. BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 49 Any cumulative gainloss recognized in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI shall not be recognized in profit or loss on de-recognition of such securities. Any interest in transferred financial assets that qualify for de-recognition that is created or retained by the Bank shall be recognized as a separate asset or liability. ii Financial Liabilities The Bank shall derecognize at financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or can celled, or expire. 2.4.5 Modifications of financial assets and financial liabilities i Financial Assets If the terms of a financial asset are modified, then the Bank shall evaluate whether the cash flows of the modified asset are substantially different. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the con tractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset shall be deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset shall be derecognized and a new financial asset shall be recog nized at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modification shall be accounted for as follows Fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs shall be included in the initial measurement of the asset and Other fees are included in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on de-recognition. If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modi fication is usually to maximize recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the Bank plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it shall first consider whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. Where the modification of a financial asset measured at amortized cost or FVOCI does not result in de-recognition of the financial asset, then the Bank shall first recalculate the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognizes the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. Any costs or fees incurred and fees received as part of the modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and shall be amortized over the remaining term of the modified financial asset. Where such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of borrower, then the gain or loss shall be presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it shall be presented as interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method. BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 50 ii Financial Liabilities The Bank shall derecognize a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms shall be recognized at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and consideration paid is recognized in profit or loss. Consideration paid shall include non-financial assets transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability. Where the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as de-recognition, then the amortized cost of the liability shall be recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any costs and fees incurred are recognized as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortized over the remain ing term of the modified financial liability by re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument. 2.4.6 Offsetting Financial assets and financial liabilities shall be offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Bank currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Income and expenses shall be presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS, or for gains and losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Banks trading activity. 2.4.7 Designation at fair value through profit or loss i Financial Assets At initial recognition, the Bank may designate certain financial assets as at FVTPL because this desig nation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch, which would otherwise arise. ii Financial Liabilities The Bank shall designate certain financial liabilities as at FVTPL in either of the following circumstances The liabilities are managed, evaluated and reported internally on a fair value basis or The designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would other wise arise. 2.5 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include notes and coins on hand, unrestricted and restricted reserve re quirement balances held with NBE and highly liquid financial assets with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, and are used by the Bank in the management of its short-term commitments.Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost in the statement of financial position. BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 51 2.6 Property, plant and equipment i Initial recognition The amount capitalized at initial recognition is the purchase price of the asset along with any further costs incurred in bringing the asset to its present condition and location. ii Subsequent valuation Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount of recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Bank recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accord ingly. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized in income statement as incurred. iii Depreciation Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows The Bank commences depreciation when the asset is available for use. Land is not depreciated. Capital work-in-progress is not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use. They are disclosed when reclassified during the year. iv Gain or losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognized is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is included in income statement when the asset is derecognized. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows Asset Class Depreciation Rate or years Useful Life Years Residual Value Building 50 5 Motor Vehicle 10 5 Computer and Related items 7 1 Furniture and Fittings 10 1 Medium lived furniture and fittings 10 1 Long lived furniture and fittings 20 1 Equipment Short lived equipment 5 1 Medium lived equipment 10 1 Lift and roofing 15 1 The Bank commences depreciation when the asset is available for use. Land is not depreciated. Capital work-in-progress is not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use. They are disclosed when reclassified during the year. iv Gain or losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognized is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is included in income statement when the asset is derecognized. Th id l l f l li d th d f d i ti f t l t d i t BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 52 BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively. 2.7 Intangible assets i Initial recognition Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalized development costs, are not capitalized and the related expenditure is reflected in income statement in the period in which the expenditure is incurred. ii Amortization The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the useful economic life. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life, or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic bene fits embodied in the asset, are accounted for by changing the amortization period or methodology, as appropriate, which are then treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expenses on intangible assets with finite lives is presented as separate line item in the income statement. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method to write down the cost of intangible assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives. Except for undisclosed useful life in the contract the Bank has used 6 years usefullife for all intangible assets the rest will use as per contract, the re sidual rate will be zero percent for all intangible asset. 2.8 Investment property Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, are classified as investment properties. Recognition of investment properties takes place only when it is probable that the future economic ben efits that are associated with the investment property will flow to the Bank and the cost can be reliably measured. This is usually when all risks are transferred. Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. The Bank has opted to subsequently carry investment property at cost and disclose fair value. Fair value is based on com parative market prices, adjusted if necessary, for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific asset. If this information is not available, the Bank uses alternative valuation methods, such as recent prices on less active markets or discounted cash flow projections. Valuations are per formed as of the reporting date by professional values who hold recognized and relevant professional qualifications and have recent experience in location and category of the investment property being valued. These valuations from the basis for the carrying amounts in the financial statements. 53 The fair value of investment property reflects, the near current market conditions. The fair value of in vestment property does not reflect future capital expenditure that will improve or enhance the property and does not reflect the related future benefits from this future expenditure other than those a rational market participant would take into account when determining the value of the property. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized to the assets carrying amount only when it is probable that fu ture economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. When part of an investment property is replaced, the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. Investment properties are derecognized when they have been disposed. Where the Bank disposes of a property at fair value in an arms length transaction, the carrying value immediately prior to the sale is adjusted to the transaction price, and the adjustment is recorded in the statement of changes in net assets available for benefit. 2.9 Lease At an inception of a contract, the Bank assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified assets, the Bank uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.This policy is applied to contracts entered into before, on or after 1 July 2019 that were previously identified as leases. Bank Acting as a Lessee At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Bank allocates consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone price. However, for leases of branches and office premises the Bank has elected to separate non-lease com ponents from the space rental payment obligations. The Bank recognizes a right-of-use of asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date,The right-of-use of asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liabil ity adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove any improvements made to branches or office premises. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commence ment date to the end of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain re-measurement of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, thebanks incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Bank uses its incremental borrowing rate at the discount rate. BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 54 The Bank determines its incremental borrowing rate by analyzing its borrowings from various external sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of asset leased. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as the commencement date Amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and The exercise price under a purchase option that the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Bank is reasonably certain not to terminate early. The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is re-measured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Banks estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guaran tee, if the Bank changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase extension or termination option if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment. When the lease liability is re-measured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of- use asset has been reduced to zero. The Bank presents right-of-use assets in property and equipment and lease liabilities in other liabilities in the statement of financial position. Short-term Leases and Leases of Low-value Assets The Bank has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for lease of low value assets and short-term leases, including ATM rent payments. The Bank recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term. Bank Acting as a Lessor At inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Bank allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the bases of their relative stand-alone selling prices. When the Bank acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether the lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Bank makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substan tially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset, if this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease if not then it is an operating lease as part of this assessment, the Bank considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset. BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 55 The Bank applies thede-recognition and impairment requirement in IFRS 9 to the net investment in the lease. The Bank further regularly reviews estimated unguaranteed residual values used in calculating the gross investment in the lease. 2.10 Non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and as safe is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, financial assets and investment property that are carried at fair value and contractual rights under in surance contracts, which are specifically exempted from this requirement. Non-current assets are classified as held for sale and measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell when a Their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through sale b They are available for immediate sale in their present condition c Their sale is highly probable. An impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset or disposal group to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognized for any subsequent increases in fair value less cost to sell of an asset or disposal group. But not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognized. A gain or loss not previously recognized by the date of the sale of the non-cur rent asset or disposal group is recognized at the date of de-recognition. Non-current assets including those that are part of a disposal group are not depreciated or amortized while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognized. Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the balance sheet. A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single coordinated plant to dispose of such a line of business of area of operations, or is a subsid iary acquired exclusively with a view of resale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the statement of profit or loss. 2.11 Impairment of non-financial assets The Bank assesses, each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required. The Bank esti mates the assets recoverable amount. An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 56 Cash-Generating Units CGU fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, and appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. The Bank bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Banks CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognized impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Bank estimates the assets or CGUs recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognized in the income statement. 2.12 Other assets Other assets are generally defined as claims held against other entities for the future receipt of money. The assets in the Banks financial statements include the following a Prepayment Prepayments are payment made in advance for services to be enjoyed in future. The amount is initially capitalized in the reporting period in which the payment is made and subsequently amortized over the period in which the service is to be enjoyed. b Other receivables Other receivables are recognized upon the occurrence of event or transaction as they arise and can celled when payment is received. The Banks other receivables are rent receivables and other receiv ables from debtors. BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 57 2.13. Inventories Held in the form of materials or supplies to be consumed in the Banks operations orin rendering of services. For BoA, inventories would normally comprisematerials and supplies not directly expended at the time of their purchase, such as stationery and printing materials, uniform, CPO, passbook, office and other general supplies. The cost of inventories of items that are ordinarily interchangeable and have not been produced and segregated for specific projects is determined by using the first-in, first-out FIFO or weighted average cost formula. The Bank uses FIFO method for measuring its inventories.The cost of inventory is recog nized as an expense when the inventory is used. 2.14 Fair value measurement The Bank measures financial instruments classified as FVTPL and FVOCI at fair value at each state ment of financial position date. Fair value related disclosures for financial instruments and non-finan cial assets that are measured at fair value or where fair values are disclosed are, summarized in the following notes Disclosures for valuation methods, significant estimates and assumptions Notes 3 and Note 4.7.1. Quantitative disclosures of fair value measurement hierarchy Notes 4.7.2. Financial instruments including those carried at amortized cost Notes 4.7.2. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place ei ther In principal market for the asset or liability, or In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Bank. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. The Bank uses valuation technique that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimiz ing the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole Level 1 Quoted unadjusted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable. BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 58 Level 3 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is observable. For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Bank determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categori zation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period. The Banks management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measure ment, such as available-for-sale financial assets. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Bank has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. 2.15 Employee benefits The Bank operates various post-employment schemes, including both defined benefit and defined con tribution pension plans and post-employment benefits. a Defined contribution plan The Bank operates two defined contribution plans i Pension scheme in line with the provisions of Ethiopian Pension of private organization employees proclamation 7152011. Funding under the scheme is 7 and 11 by employees and the Bank, respectively ii Provident fund contribution, funding under this scheme is 6 and 12 by employees and the Bank, respectively based on the employees salary. Employers contribution to this scheme are charged to profit or loss and other comprehensive income in the period in which they relate. b Defined benefit plan The liability or asset recognized in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The liability recognized in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans if the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair val ue of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 59 The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognized in the income statement in employee benefit expense, except where included in the cost of an asset, reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes curtailments and settlements. Past-service costs are recognized immediately income. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. c Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable to Bank employees and executive directors when employment is terminated by the Bank before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts volun tary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Bank recognizes termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. d Profit-sharing and bonus plans The Bank recognizes a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to the companys shareholders after certain adjustments. The Bank recognizes a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a construction obligation. 2.16 Provisions Provisions are recognized when the Bank has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, its probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Bank expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in income statement net of any re imbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as other operating ex penses. 2.17 Share capital Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options or to the acquisition of a business are shown in equality as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 60 2.18 Earnings per share The Bank presents basic earnings per share for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share are calcu lated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholder of the Bank by weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. 2.19 Income taxation a Current Income tax The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current periods taxable in come based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively en acted at the end of the reporting period in Ethiopia. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. b Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and lia bilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit nor loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realized or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable enti ties where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when they arise in the same tax reporting group and where there is both the legal right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 2.20 Interest Free Banking IFB 2.20.1 Murabaha Murabaha is an Islamic financial transaction which represents an agreement whereby the Bank buys a commoditygood and sells it to a counterparty customer based on a promise received from that coun BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 61 terparty to buy the commodity according to specific terms and conditions. The selling price comprises of the cost of the commoditygood and a pre-agreed profit margin. It is treated as financial receivables. Financial receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. The profit is quantifiable and contractually determined at the commencement of the contract. Mura baha income profit is recognized as it accrues over the life of the contract using the effective profit method EPRM on the principal balance outstanding. These products are carried at amortized cost less impairment. 2.21. Recognition of income and expenses Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Bank and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty. The Bank earns income from interest on loans given for domestic trade and services, building and con struction, manufacturing, agriculture and personal loans. Other incomes includes margins on letter of credits and performance guarantees. 2.21.1. Interest and similar income and expense For all the government bills measured at amortized cost and interest bearing financial assets classified as available for-sale interest income or expense is recorded using the effective interest rate EIR, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expect ed life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. The calculation takes into account all contractual terms of the financial instruments for example, pre payment options and includes any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instru ment and are an integral part of the effective interest rate EIR, but not future credit losses. The carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability is adjusted if the Bank revises its esti mates of payments or receipts. The adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the original EIR and the change in carrying amount is recorded as Interest and similar income for financial assets and interest and similar expenses for financial liabilities. Once the recorded value of a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been reduced due to an impairment loss, interest income continues to be recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss. BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 62 2.21.2. Net trading income Net trading income comprises gains less losses related to trading assets and liabilities, and includes all fair value changes, interest, dividends and foreign exchange differences. 2.21.3 Net interest income a Effective interest rate and amortized cost Interest income and expense are recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to The gross carrying amount of the financial asset or The amortized cost of the financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments other than credit impaired assets, the Bank estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not expected credit losses. For credit-impaired financial assets, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate is calculated using estimated future cash flows including expected credit losses. The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees and payments paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability. b Amortized cost and gross carrying amount The amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method or any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allow ance or impairment, allowance before 1 July, 2018. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortized cost of a financial asset before adjust ing for any expected credit loss allowance. c Calculation of interest income and expense In calculating interest income and expense the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset when the asset is not credit-impaired or to the amortized cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, in terest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts the gross basis. For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the asset. The calculation of interest income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves. BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 63 d Presentation Interest income and expense presented in the statement of profit or loss and OCI include Interest on financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortized cost calculated on an effective interest basis Interest on debt instruments measured at FVOCI calculated on an effective interest basis The effective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivatives designated in cash flow hedges of variability in interest cash flows, in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect interest incomeexpense and The effective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivative designated in fair value hedges of interest rate risk. Interest income and expense on all trading assets and liabilities are considered to be incidental to the Banks trading operations and are presented together with all other changes in the fair value of trading assets and liabilities in net trading income. Interest income and expense on other financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL are presented in net income from other financial instruments at FVTPL. 2.21.4. Fees and commission Fees and commission income and expenses that are integral to the effective interest rate on a financial asset-government bills or liability are included in the measurement of the effective interest rate. Other fees and commission income money transfer, letter of credit, payment orders, uncleared effects, ATM and POS transactions etc. are recognized as the related services are performed. When a loan commitment is not expected to result in the draw-down of a loan, loan commitment fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the commitment period. Other fees and commission expense relates mainly to transaction and service fees are expensed as the services are received. 2.21.5. Dividend income This is recognized when the Banks right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when the shareholders approve and declare the dividend. 2.21.6. Foreign exchange revaluation gains or losses These are gains and losses, arising on settlement and translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies of the functional currencys spot rate of exchange at the reporting date. This amount is recognized in the income statement and it is further broken down into realized and unrealized portion. The monetary assets and liabilities include financial assets within the foreign currency deposits received and held on behalf of third parties etc. BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 64 The preparation of the Banks financial statements requires management to make judgments, esti mates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liability, and the accompanying disclosures, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future period. Other disclosures relating to the Banks exposure to risks and uncertainties includes Capital management Financial risk management and policies Sensitivity analyses disclosure 3.1 Judgments In the process of applying the Banks accounting policies, management has made the following judg ments, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements. 3.2 Estimates and assumptions The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation at the reporting date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The Bank based its assumptions and esti mates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances beyond the control of the Bank. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur. 3.3 Defined benefit plans The cost of the defined benefit pension plan, long service awards, gratuity scheme and post-employ ment medical benefits and the present value of these defined benefit obligations are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the pension increases. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 3.4 Deprecation and carrying value of property, plant and equipment The estimate of the useful lives of assets is based on Managements judgment. Any material adjust ment to the estimated useful lives of items of property and equipment will have an impact on the carrying value of these items 3. Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumption BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 65 3.5 Impairment of non-financial assets Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The fair value less costs of disposal calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions, conducted at arms length, for similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a DCF model. The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Bank is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the assets performance of the CGU being tested. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purpose. 3.6 Taxes Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses to the extent that this is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilized. Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. 3.7 Development cost The Bank capitalizes development costs for a project in accordance with the accounting policy. Initial capitalization of costs is based on Managements judgment that technological and economic feasibility is confirmed, usually when a product development project has reached a defined milestone according to established project management model. In determining the amounts to be capitalized, management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, discount rates to be applied and the expected period of benefits. The development costs that were capitalized by the Bank relates to those arising from the development of computer software. 4.1 Introduction Risk is inherent in the Banks activities, but is managed through a process of ongoing identification, measurement and monitoring, subject to risk limits and other controls. This process of risk manage 4. Financial risk management BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 66 ment is critical to the Banks continuing profitability and each individual within the Bank is accountable for the risk exposures relating to his or her responsibilities. The Bank is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. It is also subject to country risk and various operating risks. The independent risk control process does not include business risks such as changes in the environ ment, technology and industry. The Banks policy is to monitor those business risks through the Banks strategic planning process. 4.1.1 Risk management structure The Asset-Liability Management Committee, is responsible for the overall risk management approach and for approving the risk management strategies and principles. It also has the responsibility to mon itor the overall risk process within the Bank. The Asset-Liability Management Committee has the overall responsibility for the development of the risk and implementing principles, frameworks, policies and limits. It is also responsible for managing risk decisions and monitoring risk levels and reports on a quarterly basis to the Board risk committee. The Credit Risk Management Committee is responsible for implementing and maintaining risk related procedures to ensure an independent control process is maintained. The unit works closely with the Management Risk Committee to ensure that procedures are compliant with overall framework. The Risk Management Unit is responsible for monitoring compliance with risk principles, policies and limits across the Bank. It carries out an assessment of risk on an ad hoc basis to monitor the Banks independent control of risks, including monitoring the risk of exposures against limits and the assess ment of risks of new products and structured transactions. This unit also ensures the complete capture of the risks in risk measurement and reporting systems. Expectations are reported, where necessary, to Senior Management and further to the board risk com mittee and the relevant actions are taken to address expectations and any areas of weakness. The Bank Treasury operation unit is responsible for managing the Banks financial assets, financial li abilities and the overall financial structure. It is also primarily responsible for the funding and liquidity risk of the Bank. The Banks policy in the risk management processes throughout the Bank are audited annually by the Internal Audit function, which examine both the adequacy of the procedures and the Banks compliance with the procedures. Internal audit function discusses the result of all assessments with management, and reports its findings recommendations to the Board Audit Committee. 4.1.2 Risk measurement and reporting systems The Banks risks are measured using a method that reflect both the expected loss likely to arise in nor mal circumstances and unexpected losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss based on scenario analysis. The analysis makes used probabilities derived from historical experience, adjusted BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 67 to reflect the economic environment. The Bank also runs worst-case scenarios that would arise in the event that extreme events which are unlikely to occur do, in fact occur. Monitoring and controlling risk is primarily performed based on limits established by the Bank. These limits reflect the business strategy and market environment of the Bank as well as the level of the risk that the Bank is willing to accept, with additional emphasis on selected regions. In addition, the Banks policy is to measure and monitor the overall risk bearing capacity in relation to the aggregated risk exposure across all risk types and activities. 4.1.3 Risk mitigation Risk controls and mitigates, identified and approved for the Bank, are documented for existing and new processes and systems. The adequacy of this mitigates is tested on a periodic basis through administration of control self- as sessment questionnaires, using an operational risk management tool which requires risk owners to confirm the effectiveness of established controls. These are subsequently audited as part of the review process. 4.2 Financial instruments by category The Banks financial assets are classified in to the following measurement categories measured at amortized cost and fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI. Financial instruments are classified in the statement of financial position in accordance with their legal form and substance. The Banks classification of financial assets is summarized in the table below BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 68 4.3 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Bank if a customer or counter party to financial instrument fail to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Banks loan and advance to cus tomers and other banks and other financial assets. Exposure to credit risk is managed through periodic analysis of the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to determine their capacity to meet principal and interest thereon, and restructuring such limits as appropriate. Exposure to credit risk is also mitigated, in parts, by obtaining collateral, commer cial and personal guarantees. The Bank structures the level of credit risk it undertakes by placing limits on the amount of risk accept ed in relation to one borrower, or groups of borrowers, and the term of the financial instruments and economic sectors. The National Bank of Ethiopia NBE sets credit risk limit for a single borrower, one related party and all related parties to not exceed 25, 15 and 35 of Banks total capital amount as of the reporting quarterly period respectively. At same time, it sets limits of NPLs ratio of 5 with reporting requirement on quarterly basis. Credit management is conducted as per the risk management policy and guideline approved by the Board of Directors.Such policies are reviewed and modified periodically based on changes and expec tations of the markets where the Bank operates, regulations and other factors. 4.3.1 Credit quality analysis The following table sets out information about the credit quality of financial asset measured at amor tized cost, FVOCI debt investment and available-for-sale debt assets.

The following table sets out the prin cipal types of collateral held against different types of financial assets. i Loans and advances to corporate customers The general creditworthiness of corporate customers tends to be the most relevant indicator of credit quality of a loan extended to himherit. However, collateral provides additional security and the Bank generally requests that corporate borrowers provide it. The Bank may take collateral in the form of a first charge over real estate, floating charges over all corporate assets and other loans and guarantees. Because of the Banks focus on corporate customers creditworthiness, the Bank does not routinely update the valuation of collateral held against all loans to corporate customers. Valuation of collateral is updated when the loan is put on a watch list and loan is monitored more closely. For credit-impaired loans, the Bank obtains appraisal of collateral because it provides input in to determining the Manage ment credit risk actions. ii Investment securities designated as at FVTPL At 30 June 2022, the Bank had no exposure to credit risk of the investment securities designated at the FVTPL. 4.3.2 Collateral held The Bank holds collateral against certain of its credit exposures.

For BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 71 Amount arising from ECL i Inputs, assumption and techniques used for estimating impairment See accounting policy in note 4.3.1 ix ii Significant increase in credit risk When determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Bank considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Banks historical experience, expert credit assessment and including for ward-looking information. The objective of assessment is to identify whether significant increase in credit risk has occurred for an exposure by comparing The remaining lifetime probability of default PD as at the reporting date with The remaining lifetime PD for this point in time that was estimated at the time of initial recog nition of the exposure adjusted when relevant for changes in prepayment expectation. The Bank uses three criteria for determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk Quantitative test based on movement in PD Qualitative indicators and A backstop of days past due. iii Credit risk grades The Bank allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on a variety of data that is determined to be predictive of the risk of default and applying experienced credit judgment. Credit risk grades are defined using qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of risk of default. These factors vary depending on the nature of the exposure and the type of borrower. Credit risk grades are defined and calibrated such that the risk of default occurring increases expo nentially as the credit risk deteriorates so, for example, the difference in risk of default between credit risk grade 1 and 2 is smaller than the difference between credit risk grade 2 and 3. Each exposure is allocated to a credit risk grade on initial recognition based on available information about the borrower. Exposures are subject to ongoing monitoring, which may result in an exposure being moved to a dif ferent credit risk grade. The monitoring typically involves use of the following data. a. Term loan exposure Information obtained during periodic review of customer file e.g. Audited financial state ments, management accounts, budgets and projections. Examples of areas of particular focus are gross profit margins, financial leverage ratio, debt service coverage, compliance with the Banks policies and procedures. Data from credit reference agencies, press articles, changes in external credit ratings BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 72 Actual and expected significant changes in the political, regulatory and technological environ ment of the borrower or in its business activities Internally collected data on customer behavior e.g. utilization of credit card facilities afford ability metrics of borrowers financial and non-financial information. b. Overdraft exposure Payment record-this includes overdue status as well as a range of variables about payment ratio. Utilization of the granted limit. Request for and granting of forbearance given due to customer financial difficulty. Existing and forecast changes in business, Financial and economic conditions of the customer economic sector iv Generating the term structure of PD Credit risk grades are a primary input in to the determination of the term structure of PD for exposures. The Bank collects performance and default information about its credit risk exposures analyzed by type of product and borrowers as well as by credit risk grading. The Bank employs statistical model to analyze the data collected and generate estimates of the remaining lifetime PD of exposures and how these are expected to change as a result of the passage of time. v Determining whether credit risk has increased significantly The Bank assesses weather credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition at each re porting date. Determining whether an increase in credit risk is significant depends on the characteristics of the financial instrument and the borrower. What is considered significant differs for different types of lending. The credit risk may also have deemed to have increased significantly since initial recognition based on qualitative factors linked to the Banks credit risk management processes that may not otherwise be fully reflected in its quantitative analysis on a timely basis. This will be the case for exposures that meet certain heightened risk criteria, such as placement on watch list. Such qualitative factors are based on its expert judgment and relevant historical experiences. As a backstop, the Bank considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs not later than when an asset is more than 30 days past due. Days past due are determined by counting the number of days since the earliest elapsed due date in respect of which full payment has not been received. Due dates are determined without considering any grace period that might be available to the borrower. If there is evidence that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk relative to initial recog nition, then the loss allowance on an instrument returns to being measured as 12-month ECL. Some qualitative indicators of an increase in credit risk, such as delinquency or forbearance, may be indicative of an increased risk of default that persist after the indicator itself has ceased to exist. In these case, the Bank determines a probation period during which the financial asset is required to demonstrate good behavior to provide evidence that its credit risk has declined sufficiently. BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 73 When contractual term of a loan has been modified, evidence that the criteria for recognizing lifetime ECL are no longer met includes a history of up-to-date payment performance against the modified contractual terms. The Bank monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify significant increase in credit risk by regular reviews to confirm that The criteria are capable of identifying significant increases in credit risk before an exposure is in default The criteria do not align with the point in time when an asset becomes 30 days past due The average time between the identification of a significant increase in credit risk and default appears reasonable -exposure are not generally transferred directly from 12-month ECL mea surement to credit impaired and There is no unwarranted volatility in loss allowance from transfers between 12-month PD stage 1 and lifetime PD stage 2. VI Definition of default The Bank considers a financial asset to be in default when The borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank in full, without recourse by the Bank to actions such as realizing security if any is held The borrower is more than 90 days past due on any material credit obligation to the Bank Overdrafts are considered as being past due once the customer has breached an advised limit or been advised of a limit smaller than the current amount outstanding or It is becoming probable that the Borrower will restructure the asset as result of bankruptcy due to the borrowers inability to pay its credit obligations. In assessing whether the borrower is in default, the Bank considers indicators that are Qualitative e.g. breaches of covenant Quantitative e.g. overdue statues and non-payment on another obligation of some issuer to the Bank and Based on data developed internally and obtained from external sources. Inputs to the assessment of weather a financial instrument is in default and their significance may vary over time to reflect changes in circumstances. The definition of default largely aligns with that applied by the Bank for regulatory capital purposes vii Incorporation of forward-looking information The Bank incorporates forward-looking information into both the assessment of whether the credit risk of an instrument has increased significantly since its initial recognition and the measurement of ECL. For each segment, the Bank formulates three economic scenarios a base case, which is the median scenario, and two less likely scenarios, one upside and one downside. For each sector, the base case is aligned with the macroeconomic models information value output, a measure of the predictive power BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 74 of the model, as well as base macroeconomic projections for identified macroeconomic variables for each sector. The upside and downside scenarios are based on a combination of a percentage error factor of each sector model as well as simulated optimistic and pessimistic macroeconomic projections based on a measure of historical macroeconomic volatilities. External information considered includes economic data and forecasts published by Fitch Solutions for merly known as Business Monitor International, an external and independent market intelligence and research institution. This is in addition to industry level, semi annual NPL trends across statistically comparable sectors. Periodically, the Bank carries out stress testing of more extreme shocks to calibrate its determination of the upside and downside representative scenarios. A comprehensive review is performed at least an nually on the design of the scenarios by a panel of experts that advises the Banks senior management. The Bank has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for each portfolio of financial instruments and, using an analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between macroeconomic variables and credit risk and credit losses. The key drivers for credit risk for each of the Banks economic sectors is summarized below The Bank defined a statistically significant correlation threshold with macroeconomic of 50.

The below scenario weightings have been observed viii Modified financial assets The contractual term of a loan may be modified for a number of reasons, including changing market conditions, customer retention and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deteriora tion of the customer. An existing loan whose terms have been modified may be derecognized and the renegotiated loan recognized as a new loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy set out. When the term of financial assets are modified and the modification dose not result in de-recognition, the determination of whether the assets credit risk has increased significantly reflects comparison of its remaining lifetime PD at the reporting date based on the modified terms with the remaining lifetime PD estimated based on data on initial recognition and the original contractual terms. When modification result de-recognition, a new loan is recognized and allocated to stage 1 assuming it is not credit- impaired at the time. The Bank renegotiates on loans to customers in financial difficulties referred to as forbearance activ ities to maximize collection opportunities and minimize the risk of default. Under the Banks forbear ance policy, loan forbearance is granted on a selective basis if the debtor is currently in default on its debt or if there is high risk of default, there is evidence that the debtor made all reasonable efforts to pay under the original contractual terms and the debtor is expected to be able to meet revised terms. The revised term usually includes extending the maturity, changing the timing of interest payment and amending the term of loan covenants. Both retail and corporate loans are subject to the forbearance policy. The Bank Credit Committee regularly reviews reports on forbearance activities. For financial asset modified as part of the Banks forbearance policy, the estimate of PD reflect whether the modification has improved or restored the Banks ability to collect interest and principal and the Banks previous experience of similar forbearance action. As part of this process,The Bank evaluate the borrowers payment performance against the modified contractual term and considers various behav ioral indicators. Generally, forbearance is qualitative indicator of significant increase in credit risk and an expectation of forbearance may constitute evidence that an exposure is credit-impaired.

Lifetime ECL is calculated by multiplying the lifetime PD by LGD and EAD. The methodology of estimating PDs is discussed above under the heading Generating the term struc ture of PD. LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is default. The Bank estimate LGD parameters based on the history of recovery rates of claims against defaulted counterparties. The LGD models consider the structure, collateral, seniority of the claim, counterparty industry and recovery cost of any collateral that is integral to the financial asset. EAD represents the expected exposure in the events of a default. The Bank derives the EAD from the current exposure to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract and arising from amortization. The EAD of a financial asset is its gross carrying amount at the time of default. For lending commitments, the EADs are potential future amounts of the guaranteed exposure when the financial guarantee becomes payable. For financial assets, EAD is determining by modeling the range of possible exposure outcomes at various points in time using scenario and statis tical techniques. As described above, and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for stage 1 financial assets, the Bank measures ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period including any borrowers extension options over which it is exposed to credit risk, even if, for credit risk management purpose, the Bank considers a longer period. The maximum contractual period extends to the date at which the Bank has the right to require repay ment of an advance or terminate a loan commitment component, or guarantee. However, for overdraft that include both a loan and undrawn commitment component, the Bank mea sures ECL over a period longer than the maximum contractual period if the Banks contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the Banks exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period. These facilitates do not have a fixed term or repayment struc ture and are managed on a collective basis. The Bank can cancel them with immediate effect but this contractual right is not enforced in the normal day-to-day management, but only when the Bank becomes aware of an increase in credit risk at the facility level. This longer period is estimated taking in to account the credit risk management actions BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 78 that the Bank expects to take, and that serve to mitigate ECL.

Amount recognized in profit or loss for investment properties BANK OF ABYSSINIA NOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022 99 20b Fair value measurement of the Banks investment properties The Banks investment property is measured at cost. These properties include those held for rental purpose and those in which the Bank occupies an insignificant portion. These properties are held to earn rentals and for capital appreciation. There are currently no restrictions on the reliability of these properties. Investment property is initially measured at cost including transaction costs and subsequently measured at depreciated cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their residual value over their estimated useful lives of 50 years. The fair value of investment properties has been disclosed as required. The fair value of the Banks Investment property as at June 30, 2016 has been arrived at by in-house engineers qualified estate surveyors and reviewed and approved by independent values. These values have appropriate qualifications and recent experience in the valuations of properties in the relevant locations. The fair value was determined based on the replacement cost concept which approximate the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between knowledgeable willing parties in an arms length transaction after proper marketing, prudently and without compulsion. This implies a market comparable approach that reflects the recent transaction price for similar properties. In estimating the fair value of the properties, the highest and best use of the properties is their current use. There has been no change to the valuation technique during the year. 20c Fair value Hierarchy Details of the Banks investment properties and information about the fair value hierarchy at 30 June 2021,and at 30 June 2022 respectively, are as follows 30 June 2022 Carrying Amount Birr000 Level 1 Birr000 Level 2 Birr000 Level 3 Birr000 Investment properties 12,339 12,339 30 June 2021 Carrying Amount Birr000 Level 1 Birr000 Level 2 Birr000 Level 3 Birr000 Investment properties 12,339 12,339 20b.
