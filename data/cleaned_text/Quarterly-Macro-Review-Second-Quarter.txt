Quarterly Macroeconomic Review AprilJune 2019 The second quarter of 2019 showed a mixed set of developments on the macroeconomic front, with adverse outturns seen in some areas inflation, exports, continued fx challenges alongside fairly positive developments with respect to year- end tax collections, private sector credit growth, progress on privatization, and improved debt sustainability indicators. The growth rate for the fiscal year ending in June 2019 likely to come out in late 2019 should show a broadly positive economic momentum, in our view, as we expect a near 8 percent outturn largely on the strength of services and construction sector activity. GDP growth GDP growth for the just-ended fiscal year will be 8.1 percent, by our estimation, in light of sector growth rates that are likely to show 3 percent expansion in agriculture per the statistical authoritys final meher harvest figures, around 10 percent growth in services judging from our review of banking, remittance, and tax collection data and 12 percent growth in industry reflecting our estimate for construction sector growth this past year. For perspective, the Ministry of Finance has recently estimated that growth was 9 percent in FY 2018-19 while the IMF estimated growth at 7.7 percent in their April 2019 WEO macro updates. A review of various indicators of economic activity which are not based on official GDP statistics suggests to us still-strong activity levels in the private sector, especially looking at figures for fuel consumption up 15, vehicle imports up 14, direct income tax collections up 33 in real terms, and bank deposit and lending levels up 8 to 13 in real terms. Investment We expect national accounts data will show that investment for the fiscal year was in the range of 30-32 percent of GDP, somewhat below last years outturn of 34 percent of GDP. While state enterprise use of bank financing is up 14 percent from year-ago levels indicative of on-going capex activities, other measures of investment activity suggest investment levels are either unchanged from last year or modestly lower government capital expenditure remained flat at around Birr 66bn in the first nine months vs same-period a year ago imports of capital goods are down 5 percent for the year and trends in foreign investment show a slower pace of inflows vs last year. With respect to the latter, a moderate drop from last years 3.8bn of FDI inflows is likely given the nine- month FDI inflow figure was only 2.4bn per NBE data and we expect the full- year outturn will be between 3.0bn to 3.5bn for FY 2018-19. Inflation Inflation remained stubbornly high in the second quarter of 2019, reaching 15.5 percent at end-June 2019, up from around 10 percent at end-2018. Month-on-month inflation peaked at 4.3 percent in May 2019, the highest in Quarterly Macroeconomic Review Second Quarter 2019 Macro Research Ethiopia RESEARCH ANALYTICS August 15, 2019 RESEARCH ANALYTICS Disclaimer This report represents solely the views, analysis, and judgement of the Cepheus research team and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Funds Managing Partners, Advisors, or Investors. 2 eight years. These developments reflect large price hikes in a few food-related items, particularly vegetables, meat, fruits, and milkegg products all of which showed over 20 percent increases over year-ago levels. Non-food and services inflation outturns were notably lower, at 10.2 and 9.2 percent respectively, suggesting that sector-specific shocks in the agricultural value-chain were among the more important contributory factors. In a separate note, we take a deeper look into the recent spike in inflation, particularly its return to the mid-teen levels, and explore the impact of various contributory factorsincluding supply- side shocks, monetary variables, and marketlogistics related factors. Monetary policy Broad money supply rose by 19.6 percent year-on-year, which is a much more restrained growth rate from the 29 percent annual growth registered in both June 2017 and June 2018. Growth in central bank money supply base money fell below 10 percent for the first time in ten years, and marks a sharp deceleration from growth rates of 23 percent and 19 percent seen at the end of the last two fiscal years. While the decelerating growth of both money supply measures is positive in helping contain inflationary pressures, the still-high inflation outturn suggests that an even further slowdown in monetary growth might have helped and was perhaps necessary to prevent inflation rates from rising to the mid-teens in recent months. Banking developments As has been the norm for many years now, Ethiopias banks posted strong growth rates in the just completed year with respect to deposits up 23 percent and lending up 28 percent. Other banking indicators showed 27 percent growth in assets, 12 percent growth in capital, and 15 percent growth in branches to 5,164 nation-wide branches as of June 2019 from 4,442 a year ago. The pace of expansion has continued to be faster at private banks than at CBE, reflecting in part the latters already large starting base. Preliminary profit figures being reported by some of the largest banks suggest banking industry profits will hit a record high and should be very much in line with the projection of near Birr 30bn contained in our Banking Sector Review of May 2019. Fiscal policy Revenue collections reached a record high of Birr 198bn in FY 2018- 19, up 12 percent from the previous year though only around 68 of the governments ambitious plans. Domestic tax collections grew by a strong 16 percent for the year, while import-related tax rose by 7 percent despite near zero growth in imports. Revenue collections still remain low relative to GDP 10, but a number of administrative reforms and initiatives undertaken by the Revenue Authority are contributing to significant improvement in tax collections, and this trend is likely to continue in the years ahead. Debt Total public debt reached 52.6 bn end-March 2019, up by 1bn for the quarter, but showing a reduction when expressed relative to GDP from 59 percent at end-June 2018 to 55.6 percent at end-March 2019. Looking only at external debt, this now stands at 28.5 percent of GDP, down from 30.8 percent of GDP in June 2018. RESEARCH ANALYTICS Disclaimer This report represents solely the views, analysis, and judgement of the Cepheus research team and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Funds Managing Partners, Advisors, or Investors. 3 Trade Exports fell by 6 percent and reached only 2.6bn for the fiscal year, or the lowest value in nine years. The two largest export categories, coffee and oil seeds, both showed declines of about 8 percent, which could not offset positive outturns seen for khat up 15 percent, flowers up 12 percent, and textile and garment exports up 47 percent. Coffee continues to be particularly affected by large drops in the international price, which fell to a multi-year low of near 2 per kg, from around 4 per kg five years ago. Balance of payments BOP BOP data for the first nine-months of the fiscal year show only a slight deterioration in the trade deficit, helped by the fact that despite an 8 percent export declineimports were essentially flat over the same period. Strong fx inflows were seen from service exports 3.8bn in nine months and up 23 percent as well as from remittances 4.5bn in nine months and up 21 percent. At the same time, fx inflows in grants and loans over the nine months to March 2019 were somewhat lower than the same period last year, but this likely reflects the timing of lumpy official sector inflows and full-year figures are likely to show increases for both line-items. With respect to fx reserves, NBE data for end-March 2019 show a level of 3,920mn see Quarterly Bulletin Appendix Table 1a, roughly unchanged from its end-December 2018 level but a marked improvement from end-June 2018 figure of 2,854mn. For the overall balance of payments position, calculated based on the change in the banking systems holdings of net foreign assets, the nine month period reveals a 482mn deficit, but this figure is likely to improve in the last quarter due to end fiscal year official sector inflows and we would expect only a modest BOP deficit in the range of 200 to 300 million for the full 2018-19 fiscal year, broadly similar to last years 200mn deficit outturn.1 Exchange rate The exchange rate moved from 27.26 at end-June 2018 to 28.91 at end-June 2019, a 6 percent depreciation rate for the fiscal year and largely in line with our projected depreciation rate for the year. The depreciation effected over the year has not fully covered the 15 percent period-average inflation registered during this period, suggesting some loss in competitiveness on a real effective exchange rate basis given very low inflation in most partner countries. Sovereign bond The decline in Ethiopias sovereign bond yield continued during the quarter, and it now at stands at 5.71 percent, one of the lowest levels seen in many years and down from 7.56 percent at end-December 2018. Given similar yield declines in most EM markets, this yield improvement has largely reflected broader sentiment towards emerging markets and not necessarily Ethiopia- specific developments. Macro-structural reforms A range of macro-oriented structural reforms have been launched or implemented in the second quarter. Most notably, tax 1 Gross fx reserve levels capture the central banks fx holdings without accounting for any of its liabilities. The Net Foreign Asset NFA position of the banking system, which is used to derive the overall balance of payments position, reflects fx reserves less liabilities and covers the central bank plus all commercial banks the NFA position reflects the financial systems net FX holdings at any point in time. Figures for these variables are available on a quarterly basis in the NBE Quarterly Bulletin Annex, specifically Table 1a NBE Assets, Table 1b NBE Liabilities and Table 6 International Reserves and Net Foreign Assets of NBE and Commercial Banks.

In other areas, initiatives have focused on improving the ease of doing business liberalizing foreign exchange rules for oil and gas companies and liberalizing foreign ownership restrictions in selected sectors.

While the full details of the program are yet to be released, its broad diagnosis and prescriptions suggest that it couldwith full implementationhelp address both urgent near-term macro issues inflation, fx shortages as well as longer-term ones maintaining broad-based growth, boosting employment, and improving debt sustainability. Looking more specifically at the year ahead, and working on the assumption of no major political disturbances, we see a broadly favourable macroeconomic outlook for FY 2019-20, characterized by still-high GDP growth, inflation in the low teens, strong credit growth especially to the private sector, and gradually improving fx conditions on the back of continued FDI inflows, rising remittanceofficial inflows, and the prospect for a major telecom related fx inflow being booked by June 2020. GDP growth We expect GDP growth to be around 8.5 percent in FY 2019-20, slightly higher than last year, reflecting somewhat better agriculture sector prospects given above-average rainfall being recorded this rainy season and a stronger expansion forecast for industry based on an improvement in power supplies beginning July 2019 and fuller execution anticipated on public and private construction projects. Inflation Given where the consumer price index currently stands vs year ago levels, we are now of the view that inflation is unlikely to return to single digits any time soon. We expect month-on-month inflation rates will remain in the 0.7 to 1.0 percent range for a couple more months in line with their historical norms at this time of year and expect to see much lower andor negative month-on- month inflation figures only after the October-November crop harvests. Accordingly, we see year-on-year inflation staying within the range of 13-15 percent up to December 2019, and declining from its mid-teen levels in early 2020 when favourable base effects i.e. the high index level in early 2019 will help produce lower year-on-year inflation figures. We forecast inflation will fall to 10.5 percent by the end of the fiscal year end-June 2020. Fiscal policy and debt The new budget approved by Parliament on July 8, 2019 shows planned government expenditure of Birr 387bn, of which 75 percent is to be covered by revenue and grants Birr 253bn in revenue and Birr 36.8 in grants while the remaining 25 percent equal to Birr 97.1bn or 3 percent of GDP represents planned new borrowing for the year. As summarized in our review of the new budget, the fiscal stance adopted by the government isin our view safe, sound, and sensible, given its expenditure restraint to address prevailing 2 The home-grown economic policy program was passed at a Council of Ministers meeting in June 2019 and further articulated by the PMs policy advisors at a public forum held at the Prime Ministers office on August 12, 2019.

This should bring aggregate banking deposits to Birr 1.1 trillion by June 2020 equal to 33 percent of GDP while the ratio of total bank financing to deposits after accounting for reserve requirements and NBE Bills should remain a very high 98 percent, revealing the near-full deployment of mobilized deposits. We expect the central bank will retain its current stance of tight reserve money growth only 9. 6 percent as of March 2019 alongside near 20 percent broad money growth, though it is possible that it may do more to limit broad money growth should inflation fail to show a notable decline by early 2020. Balance of payments The outlook for the balance of payments in FY 2019-20 is marked by significant uncertainties in several areasparticularly with respect to exports will there be a turnaround after several years of declines? and the timing of privatization inflows will any of the initial sales be booked by June 2020?. We make our judgements for these key items and expect the bottom- line to show a sizeable surplus for the fiscal year. On exports, we do not yet see a major turnaround given global trade conditions, low commodity prices, and still-persistent near-term challenges in specific sectors coffee, oilseeds, gold. We thus forecast only modest growth for the year 3 percent, with this being driven by products such as chat, textilesgarments, leather products, and flowers that showed strength in recent quarters. For imports, after two years of nearly flat imports at 15bn per year, we anticipate growth of around 8 percent this year, given a fuller execution of government projects and stronger FDI inflows which are typically quite import-intensive. We expect continued increases in services exports 10 percent growth, reflecting tourism and airline activity, and see remittances rising from near 6bn last year to 6.6 bn this year 8 percent growth. We also anticipate moderate increases in grant inflows to 1.4bn and in new concessional borrowing to 2.0bn, both reflecting the closer re- engagement with donors and external financiers. For FDI, we project inflows of around 4.5bn on the basis of 3.5bn in regular inflows and 1.0bn in assumed privatization andor telecom license sale related fx inflows that are received by June 2020. Taken all together, we expect a surplus of just above 1bn on the balance of payments this year, which will raise gross official fx reserves from their estimated level of 3.6bn at end-June 2019 to 4.75bn by end-June 2020. Exchange rate With respect to the expected movement in the exchange rate, the governments budget document has specified a planned depreciation of 6 percent for the fiscal year. On this basis, the Birr should reach a rate of 30.63 3 See Cepheus Research note on Ethiopias 2019-20 Budget July 10, 2019 for further background.

However, we note that a 6 percent depreciation will continue to imply a loss in external competitiveness given that year-on-year inflation is forecast to be in the range of 10-11 percent by the end of this fiscal year and considering very low inflation in most partner countries. In principle, therefore, if high priority is to be given to preventing a loss in external competitiveness, the central bank may be motivated to engineer a depreciation on the order of 10-11 percent for the fiscal year. While this is a possible outcome, especially if exports continue to perform poorly, we think the more probable outturngiven the clear public statement made in the budget documentis for a 6 percent depreciation and thus take that as our base case projection for this fiscal year.

Output grew strongly for most cereal crops, but was dragged down by declines in oilseeds. With output up 3.1 and harvested area up only 0.4, this implies yields are up by about 2.7. Growth projections With lower growth for agriculture which makes up 36 of GDP, we reduce our initial growth projection by around 1 percentage point to 8.1 percent. We keep roughly unchanged expected growth in industry, currently dominated by the construction sector.

Inflation projections High month-on-month inflation has continued at 1.3 even with the start of the new fiscal year July 2019. We forecast at least two more months of high m-o-m inflation of between 0.7 to 1.0 until the start of the crop harvest season. Given where the price index already stands, we project mid-teens inflation to continue to end-December 2019.

Spending on current and capital expenditure is essentially flat vs the same period last year. The nine-month deficit appears in line with the targeted full-year deficit set in the budget. Public debt, in USD terms Overall public debt is up by 1 bn in the quarter, mostly reflecting a rise in domestic debt. The share of domestic debt in total public debt is now 49 percent. Public debt, relative to GDP Public debt is now around 55.6 of current year's estimated USD GDP, down from near 59 percent as of June 2018. External public debt relative has fallen to below 30 percent of GDP.

Since the start of the new fiscal year, monthly depreciations have been 12 cents based on July data and extrapolating half-month August data. Exchange rate projections Per the budget document of July 2019, the Birr is expected to depreciate by 6 percent. This target depreciation implies a rate of 29.73 BirrUSD at end-Dec 2019 and 30.63 BirrUSD at end-June 2020. The target depreciation rate will imply some loss in external competitiveness, given forecast inflation differences with trading partners. To avoid a loss in competitivess i.e no REER appreciation, a depreciation rate of closer to 10-11 percent would be warranted, implying a rate of near 32 BirrUSD by end-June 2020 though this is not the base case considered for the purposes of our projections.

Spread vs US Treasuries Reflecting the falling yields, spreads vs US Treasuries have also declined and now stand at just 395 basis points.
