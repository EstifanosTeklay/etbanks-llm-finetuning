This module aims to equip youth and Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises MSMEs with the necessary knowledge, skills, and confidence to make informed financial decisions and improve their financial well-being. We are delighted to present the Financial Education Module for Youth, Women, and MSMEs, a comprehensive module developed in collaboration between the National Bank of Ethiopia and the Financial Education Working Group. Acknowledging the significance of financial education in promoting financial inclusion, the National Bank of Ethiopia NBE has formulated the Financial Education Strategy 2021-2025 to ensure that 75 of adults in the country possess knowledge about financial products and services by 2025. The lack of nationally coordinated financial education programs, fragmented modules, and ineffective delivery channels have contributed to Ethiopias low financial education and literacy levels. To address this issue, the strategy emphasizes the necessity of developing and standardizing national financial education materials, modules, and delivery channels. The National Bank of Ethiopia, as a key regulatory institution, provided valuable insights and guidance to ensure the modules alignment with national financial education strategies and objectives. The Mastercard Foundation, in partnership with First Consult under the BRIDGES program, brought expertise in inclusive finance and sustainable development, contributing to the modules comprehensive approach. The Financial Education Working Group was pivotal in this collaborative effort, bringing diverse perspectives, experiences, and expertise together. The contributions of the working group members, including financial experts and representatives from various organizations, enriched the modules content and ensured its practicality and effectiveness. Drawing on international best practices, local insights, and research-based methodologies, the financial education module seeks to provide accessible and practical information on a wide range of financial topics. The module aims to cater to diverse audiences, including youth, women, MSMEs, and entrepreneurs, through interactive learning materials, workshops, and innovative delivery mechanisms. This module aspires to foster a culture of responsible financial behavior, promote savings habits, encourage entrepreneurship, and facilitate access to financial services by equipping individuals with financial literacy skills. Ultimately, the modules goal is to contribute to building a financially inclusive society where individuals have the knowledge and tools to navigate the financial landscape effectively. Most importantly, it increases the financial inclusion target set by NBE to achieve 75 of adults to report on their awareness about financial products and services by 2025. Let us embark on this journey towards financial empowerment and inclusive growth together. H.E. Mamo Mihretu Governor, National Bank of Ethiopia Samuel Yalew Ethiopia Country Director, Mastercard Foundation Nebil Kellow Managing Director, First Consult X Introduction Introduction - Setting the Scene Financial literacy is the ability to understand finance. It refers to the set of skills and knowledge that allows an individual to understand the available financial services and make informed and timely financial decisions. Financial literacy is not automatically achieved with access to finance deliberate financial education measures are needed to improve it. Financial education is a way to increase financial literacy. Financial education teaches the knowledge, skills, and attitudes required to adopt good money management practices for earning, spending, budgeting, borrowing, saving, and using other financial services such as insurance, money, and transfers. Participants in financial education are equipped with the information and tools to make better financial choices and work towards their financial goals to enhance their economic well-being. Because of this, the importance of financial education programs has been an area of interest to both developing and developed countries. Given the cost of education programs, taking financial education measures with target segments of especially low financial literacy may be cost-effective. As a result, many countries have taken comprehensive national initiatives and programs that different donor organizations support. This financial education material has been supported by the Mastercard Foundation to develop a national standardized document. St. Marys University developed this document in close collaboration with First Consult and the National Bank of Ethiopia. This document contains ten specific and interrelated modules, which are listed below 1 Introduction to Business Entrepreneurship 2 Goal Setting 3 Budgeting 4 Basics of Bookkeeping 5 Saving - You can do it 6 Investment 7 Sources of Finance 8 Financial Services 9 Digital Financial Services 10 Risk Management and Insurance XI Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs Aims of the Module This training module aims to provide learners with the essential knowledge, skills, and attitudes to help them manage their finances in the most beneficial way possible. It will also give the youth and MSMEs the basic tools necessary to improve their financial situation and broaden their understanding of the business environment, which can contribute to scaling up Ethiopias financial inclusion and literacy strategies. Scope of the Module The module is prepared at the basic level. It mainly targets the youth and MSME operators. The module is written in plain language and designed to ensure the participants understand it as quickly, easily, and thoroughly as possible. Regarding the learning curve between the rural and urban trainees, participants in urban areas generally have more resources and better facilities, such as books and other learning materials, compared to their rural counterparts. Thus, reducing the geographical learning gap between rural and urban participants requires improving rural participants educational opportunities up to the level of their urban peers. Training Delivery Approach The module is prepared to serve as financial education training material for youth and MSMEs. Its contents are customized and prepared to address the specific needs of the participants to ensure sound transfer of financial knowledge. Thus, the module would be a guideline, reference material, and working document primarily for financial institutions regulated by the NBE and other financial education providers where appropriate. The NBE would promote its effective implementation and ensure that the materials are updated when the circumstances in regulatory and market environments are requires to do so, The trainers manual is prepared with this module as a blueprint. This manual guides trainers in knowing and understanding the curriculum, preparing training, gathering needed materials, lesson planning, and ones eventual relationship with each participant. All trainers who will deliver this training to the youth and MSME operators need to complete a Training of Trainers TOT delivered by the experts involved in preparing this module or other specialists in the area. The TOT training should ideally be run over three days to go through the curriculum in detail and for trainers to be well prepared to deliver the training successfully. It is strongly advised that the number of TOT participants not exceed 20. At least two experts and a facilitator need to run the TOT to ensure the high quality of the training. To be fully certified, trainees need to attend all training on the ten modules. The training will be delivered in three phases. Phase 1 covers the first three modules Introduction to Business Entrepreneurship, Goal Setting, and Budgeting. After completing the three-day training, trainees will take assignments that will be returned to the trainers when they return for the second training phase. The details of the assignments are indicated in the trainers manual. Phase 2 covers the next four modules Basics of Bookkeeping, Saving, Investment, and Sources of Finance. After completing the four-day training, trainees will take assignments that will be returned to the trainers when they return for the third training phase. The details of the assignments are indicated in the trainers manual. XII Introduction Phase 3 covers the last three modules Financial Services, Digital Financial Services, Risk Management and Insurance. The last phase will take three days. After completing all ten modules, trainees will get certificates of attendance. The training sessions are designed with concrete examples of the youth and MSME operators in their daily lives, as well as interactive activities, audios, exercises, and assignments, to make the content interesting, relevant, and entertaining. It is recommended that those trainers know English and the local language. Trainers need to use adult learning techniques with due consideration for the unique learning needs of participants. Using adult learning principles and practices can increase the likelihood that the learners will enjoy and use the training to change their financial behaviors. Adults learn more effectively with a learner-centered approach. Adults must have an opportunity to reflect on new content, relate it to their personal situations, practice using it, and determine how they can apply it nine adult education principles and practices are presented below. Therefore, trainers are expected to act as facilitators, not lecturers. Moreover, trainers should act as role models to the beneficiaries and be able to think outside of the box. Trainers need to personalize the content and use the curriculum as a guide that can be adapted to the participants and their levels of knowledge and understanding. Table 1. The Nine Principles and Practices of Adult Education Principle Description Relevance Learners learn best when drawing on their own knowledge and experience. Learning must meet the real-life needs of the adult for example, job and family life issues. Dialogue Learning must be two-way to allow learners to interact with the teacher and other learners. Engagement Learning must involve learners through discussion, small groups, and learning from peers. Immediacy Learners must be able to apply the new learning immediately. 204080 Rule Learners remember more when visual aids support verbal instructions, and adults recall best when they practice the new skill. We remember 20 of what we hear, 40 of what we hear and see, and 80 of what we hear, see, and do. Cognitive, Affective, and Psychomotor Interaction Learning should involve thinking and emotions as well as doing. Respect Learners need to feel respected and as equals. Affirmation Learners need to receive praise, even for small efforts. Safety Learners need to feel that others value their ideas and contributions that others will not belittle or ridicule them. The first seven principles are designed into the learning activities, while the last two need to be practiced in delivering the learning event. Adopted from Microfinance Opportunities XIII Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs Training Evaluation Training sessions will be organized by NBE and other stakeholders to realize the module objectives and expected learning outcomes. The trainers manual indicates that trainers are expected to prepare training program outlines and reports, including survey results and participant feedback. The evaluation methods used during and at the end of each training session will vary per the trainers approach. However, as a general rule, trainers are expected to encourage participants to engage in group discussions and to forward self-reflections on the main agenda carefully chosen for discussions. Finally, participants conceptual and practical understanding will be evaluated using practical exercises and exams. Moreover, Kirkpatricks four-level model of training evaluation criteria will be used to verify the effectiveness and goal achievement and identify the areas that require improvement. The model helps conceptualize the assessment of learning outcomes of the financial education training program with metrics and instruments. It is instrumental in determining the strengths and weaknesses of the financial education training process. The model consists of four levels reaction, learning, behavior, and results. Figure 1. Kirkpatricks Four-Level Model of Training Evaluation Reaction Measures whether learners ﬁnd the ﬁnancial education training engaging, favorable, and relevant to their jobs.

Introduction to Business Business, also known as an enterprise or a firm, is an organization that trades goods, services, or both to consumers to make a profit. The Commercial Code 2021 presents the following types of business organizations a. General partnership A business organization consisting of partners jointly and severally liable with to the partnership itself for its obligations. Any agreement to the contrary may not be invoked against third parties. b. Limited partnership This type of partnership comprises partners with different types of liability general partners who are fully liable jointly and severally with the partnership for its obligations, and limited partners who are liable for the partnerships obligations only to the extent of their pledged contributions. c. Limited liability partnership A business organization formed by two or more persons to render professional services and services complementary to it, in which the partners liability is limited to the amount of their contributions. d. Joint venture A business organization established by an agreement between two or more people. It has no legal personality, and its existence is unknown to third parties. Registration formalities required of other business organizations do not apply to a joint venture. e. Share Company A company whose capital is fixed in advance, divided into shares, and whose liabilities are met only by the companys assets. The shareholders obligation is limited to making the contribution they pledged to the company. f. Private limited company A business organization whose capital is fully paid in advance and divided into shares and whose members are not liable for the companys debts, provided they have paid their contributions. Shares of the company shall not be open for subscription to the public. g. One-person private limited company A business organization incorporated by the unilateral declaration of a single person. The company has a legal personality separate and distinct from that of the member. The member shall not be personally liable for debts due by the company in so far as he has fully made his contribution. On the other hand, being an entrepreneur is distinct from being a businessperson. Unlike businesspeople who work with existing ideas, entrepreneurs are generally seen as innovators and leaders. Entrepreneurship is about looking forward identifying opportunities, creating a vision of how the business will grow, innovating, and taking risks. Dear participants, write the name of one person you consider a your role model entrepreneur, and the key qualities that make the person a successful entrepreneur. 4 Module One Introduction to Business and Entrepreneurship Important Message An entrepreneur is an individual who Has a dream and vision. Has the ability to identify and pursue a business opportunity. Undertakes a business venture. Gathers physical, financial, and human resources needed to operate the business venture. Sets goals for himherself and others. Initiates appropriate actions to ensure success. Assumes all or a major portion of the risk. Is a job creator, not a job seeker. 1.2. The Business Plan Putting your ideas and information together is called making a business plan. It is a guide to follow so you do not overlook anything when preparing to open your new business. You need to prepare the business plan because it helps you to Decide if you should start your business. Starting a business will change your life completely. Therefore, you need to make sure that you make the right decision. The business plan will help you judge whether or not starting a business is the right decision. Organize your ideas so that you will see how to start and run your business best. The business plan follows a standard sequence of relevant topics, which will help you visualize the road ahead. Present your business plan to investors or a lending institution, such as a bank or a microfinance institution, to obtain a loan. By preparing the business plan yourself, you can answer most of the questions they may ask. A business plan will vary depending on the nature of your business and the audience you are preparing it for. Regardless of the audience, a business plan allows you to map out your business, its timeline, and its responsibilities and explore its viability. If you are using your business plan to get a loan, you must show how your business will make money to repay the loan.

Steps in financial goal setting Brainstorm Dear participants, answer the following questions Do you have goals in life? Do you think it is important to have goals? Explain why some people dont reach their financial goals. 13 Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs 2.1. Understanding Goals Dear participants Hana and Kuma have their own idea of building a Coffee Hub in the future. What Hana and Kuma want to accomplish in the near future needs to be well articulated, as that is instrumental in differentiating between a dream and a goal. From the perspective of The Coffee Hub, a goal can be defined as a statement about what Hana and Kuma want to accomplish. A goal provides a direction to a plan of action, as exemplified by what Hana and Kuma want to achieve at a specific time in the future. A goal helps Hana and Kuma decide what to prioritize and how to spend their time and resources. Dreams will remain fantasies until Hana and Kuma take steps to make them real. The difference between dreams and goals is the level of commitment. Goals are a source of motivation and confidence when realizing a dream. Goal setting Refers to determining what Hana and Kuma want to be, do, or have i.e., what they want to accomplish by offering a unique coffee experience through The Coffee Hub business. Goal-setting involves developing an action plan to motivate and guide a person or group toward a goal. Dear participants The wishes of Hana and Kuma can become goals only through the power of planning. Thus, a goal without a plan is just a wish. If you walk without knowing where you want to go, you will end up somewhere, but not in the right place. You must know that the perfect time to start planning will likely never come. There is no better time than now to get started. Goals evolve during a lifetime and differ from person to person. Hana and Kuma can have personal, family, financial, andor business goals. 14 Module Two Goal Setting 2.2 Understanding Financial Goal Setting Dear participants, Hana and Kuma need to understand financial goal setting for The Coffee Hub. A financial goal is an objective individualsinstitutions set to attain certain monetary milestones. Setting a financial goal is key to success and attaining financial freedom. Benefits of having financial goals to Hana and Kuma 1. Helps them decide their spending priorities for the future. 2. Gives them discipline for spending and saving. 3. Helps avoid unexpected money shortages. 4. Helps them feel less financial stress. The Coffee Hub Dream Practical Exercise Dear Participants Read The Coffee Hub Dream below and answer the questions that follow 15 Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs Hana and Kuma are young entrepreneurs keen to establish a new business named The Coffee Hub.

They would like to set up The Coffee Hub to offer a unique coffee experience to busy professionals around Sengatera, Addis Ababa. They know they can rely on the expertise they have learned from similar businesses. Furthermore, Hana and Kuma would like to do some entrepreneurship training by way of preparation and also buy the necessary equipment for the business. At the same time, they are thinking of helping two of their close friends, Yohannes and Meseret, to set up a barbershop. Hana and Kuma also dream of buying an automobile for door-to-door delivery service. Questions What are Hana and Kumas dreams? Have you ever thought about your goals? If so, what are they? What do you think they need to do to realize The Coffee Hub Dream? 16 Module Two Goal Setting 2.3. Timeframes in Goal Setting Dear participants, in groups, discuss the importance of having a timeframe for setting goals for The Coffee Hub.

L o n g - T e r m G o a l s S h o r t - T e r m G o a l s M e d i u m - T e r m G o a l s Goals Financial goals serve as a guide to help Hana and Kuma define their path and keep them on it. This requires them to set their financial goals in terms of a timeframe. Some goals may be achieved very quickly, some may take a few years, and others may take longer or even decades. Table 2. Types of financial goals As the table below indicates, personal financial goals differ in the time needed to achieve them. Types of financial goals Description Short-term goals They are immediate priorities that can be accomplished shortly in two years or less. Medium-term goals These are priorities that can be accomplished within two to five years. Long-term goals These are priorities that may take more than five years to accomplish.

It is the starting point for your financial planning process. The common sources of income, such as crop production, dairy production, forest production, petty trade, construction, artisan, salary, bonuses, pensions, etc., generate cash that you can use to spend, save, or invest. Income can be thought of as the first step in our personal finance roadmap. Group exercise Dear Participants, please discuss in groups and suggest some sources of income for starting The Coffee Hub.

The Concept of Bookkeeping What is bookkeeping? Bookkeeping is the process of recording and tracking financial transactions. It is essential to running any business however, it can be especially challenging for MSMEs.

Basic Bookkeeping Concepts and Principles Understanding basic accounting concepts is essential for effective financial management and business decision-making. Here is a note on the basic accounting concepts Entity Concept The business should be treated as a separate legal and financial entity from its owners this concept ensures that the businesss financial transactions and records are distinct from the owners finances. Money Measurement Concept The business transactions should be recorded and reported in monetary terms. This concept allows quantifying and measuring the businesss financial activities, such as revenue, expenses, and assets. Going Concern Concept The business should be assumed to continue operating indefinitely unless there is evidence to the contrary. This concept allows for preparing financial statements, assuming the company will continue its operations and fulfill its obligations. Matching Concept The business should match its expenses with the related revenues in the same accounting period. For example, in the Coffee Hub case, the costs of purchasing coffee beans and other supplies should match the revenues generated from selling coffee during the same period. This concept helps to determine accurate net income for each accounting period. Consistency Concept Apply consistent accounting methods and practices from one period to another. Consistency in financial reporting ensures comparability and reliability in presenting financial information over time. Measurement Principles Historical cost The business should record its assets at their historical cost, the original cost incurred to acquire them. This concept ensures that the financial statements reflect the actual cost of the assets and provide a reliable basis for decision-making. The fair value principle states that assets and liabilities should be reported at fair value the price received to sell an asset or settle a liability. 49 Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs 4.4.

It is recommended to consult with an accountant or a bookkeeping professional to tailor the chart of accounts to your business accurately. 2. Sales Recording Sales is exchanging a commodity or service for money. Implementing a point-of-sale POS system and automatically tracking and recording sales transactions is recommended. This system should capture details like the date, time, products sold, and payment method. It will provide an accurate daily sales record and simplify the reconciliation process. The following is a sample sales recording table for The Coffee Hub Transaction Date Time Product Quantity Unit price Total 1 9162023 1030 AM Cappuccino 10 40.00 400 2 9162023 1035 AM Latte 1 40.00 40 3 9162023 1040 AM Espresso 2 35.00 70 4 9162023 1045 AM Espresso 3 35.00 105 5 9162023 1050 AM Muffin 2 25.00 50 6 9162023 1055 AM Coffee 2 32.00 64 7 9162023 1100 AM Tea 2 15.00 30 8 9162023 1105 AM Tea 2 15.00 30 9 9162023 1110 AM Coffee 2 32.00 64 10 9162023 1115 AM Coffee 3 32.00 96 Total Sales ETB 949 The above is a sample format of sales records. You can change it according to your preference. By maintaining a sales recording like this, business organizations can track their daily sales, analyze popular products, monitor customer preferences, and evaluate their overall performance. Data like this can then be used to make informed business decisions, optimize inventory management, and improve customer satisfaction. 51 Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs 3. Expense Tracking Expense refers to all resources paid or consumed to generate sales. Business organizations need to keep track of all expenses incurred by the business. Categorize expenses into relevant accounts, such as rent, utilities, inventory, supplies, and wages. Retain receipts and invoices as supporting documentation. Here is a sample expense tracking table for The Coffee Hub Date Category Expense Description Amount ETB 0192023 Rent Monthly Shop Rent 2500 692023 Utilities Electricity Bill 200 692023 Supplies Coffee Beans 300 692023 Marketing Social Media Advertising 150 692023 Equipment Espresso Machine Repair 120 792023 Salaries Barista Wages 800 792023 Insurance Business Liability Insurance 250 8102023 Utilities Water Bill 50 1092023 Supplies Milk and Syrups 100 1192023 Marketing Print Flyers 50 Total Expenses ETB 4,520.00 The above is a sample format of expense tracking. You can change it according to your preference. This expense tracking table allows Hana and Kuma to record their business expenses, monitor spending in different categories, and analyze their overall expenditure. By maintaining accurate expense records, they can effectively assess their financial health budget and make informed decisions to ensure The Coffee Hubs financial stability and success. 4. Cash Management Maintain a cash register or drawer to record all transactions. Reconcile the cash register daily to ensure accuracy and identify any discrepancies. You can use a format similar to a sales recording table. 5. Bank Reconciliation Regularly reconcile the business bank accounts with the corresponding records in the bookkeeping system. Compare bank statements with recorded transactions to identify discrepancies, such as missing transactions or errors. This process helps ensure that the recorded financial data is accurate. 52 Module Four Basics of Bookkeeping 6. Inventory Management Implement an inventory management system to track the quantities and values of coffee beans, supplies, and other items in the coffee hub case. Regularly update inventory records to reflect purchases, sales, and any adjustments such as spoilage or wastage. 7. Payroll Records Maintain accurate records of employee wages, benefits, and deductions. This includes tracking hours worked, calculating payroll taxes, and ensuring compliance with labor laws. Consider using payroll software or outsourcing payroll services for efficiency and accuracy. I. Financial Statements Prepare regular financial statements, including the income statement profit and loss statement and statement of financial position. II. The income statement presents the revenues and expenses and the resulting net income or net loss for a specific period. Net income revenues are greater than expenses Net loss If revenues are less than expenses III. Statement of financial position reports the assets, liabilities, and owners equity at a specific date. Income Statement Profit and Loss Statement The Coffee Hub Income Statement For the Year Ended 07-July-23 Sales ETB XXX,XXX Cost of Goods Sold XXX,XXX Gross Profit ETB XXX,XXX Operating Expenses Rent XX,XXX Utilities XX,XXX Salaries XX,XXX Marketing XX,XXX Other Expenses XX,XXX Total Operating Expenses XXX,XXX 53 Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs Note The Income Statement presents the revenues, expenses, and resulting net income for a specific period in this case, the year ended on December 31, 2023. It starts with sales, subtracting the cost of goods sold to calculate gross profit. Then, operating expenses such as rent, utilities, salaries, marketing, and other expenses are deducted to arrive at the net income. The net income represents the profit or loss generated by the business during the specified period. If your business is small and may not require formal financial reporting, you can use the following format to calculate revenues and expenses. Revenues Expenses - Date Description Amount Date Description Amount xx xxx Xxx xxx xxx xxx xx xxx Xxx xxx xxx xxx Total revenues Xxx Total Expenses xxx The statement of financial position Balance sheet The Coffee Hub Statement Of Financial Position Balance Sheet As of December XX, 2023 Assets Cash and Cash Equivalents ETB XX,XXX Accounts Receivable ETB XX,XXX Inventory ETB XX,XXX Prepaid Expenses ETB XX,XXX Total Assets ETB XXX,XXX Liabilities Accounts Payable ETB XX,XXX Short-term Loans ETB XX,XXX Accrued Expenses ETB XX,XXX Total Liabilities ETB XXX,XXX Equity Owner's Capital ETB XXX,XXX Retained Earnings ETB XX,XXX Total Equity ETB XXX,XXX Total Liabilities and Equity ETB XXX,XXX 54 Module Four Basics of Bookkeeping Note The statement of financial position provides a snapshot of the companys position on a specific date. It lists the assets for example, cash, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses, liabilities for example, accounts payable, short-term loans, costs accrued, and equity owners capital, retained earnings. The total assets should equal the total liabilities and equity, representing the companys financial worth. These financial statements can help to track and analyze financial performance and position. They are essential for monitoring profitability, managing expenses, making financial decisions, and presenting the businesss financial health to potential investors or stakeholders. 8. Backup and Security Regularly back up financial data to prevent loss or damage. Implement security measures to protect sensitive financial information, such as using secure servers and restricting access to unauthorized personnel. 9. Periodic Review Conduct regular reviews of the financial records to identify trends, analyze expenses, and assess the businesss overall financial health. This will enable business managers to make informed decisions and identify areas for improvement. It is recommended to consult with an accountant or bookkeeping professional to ensure compliance with local regulations, optimize their bookkeeping processes, and receive guidance on best practices specific to their business.

It is important to regularly review and adjust the calculations based on a small businesss specific costs, prices, and expenses as the business progresses and circumstances change. 4.5. The Objective and the Users of Financial Reporting Financial reporting aims to provide useful information to decision-makers users. It is the language used to communicate with stakeholders. Dear participants, who do you think are potential users of your companys financial reports, and for what purpose? Potential users of financial reports can be internal or external stakeholders of the business. Internal users Managers - To analyze performance and make strategic decisions. Employees To understand the financial health and stability of the company External users Investors - To analyze risk and assess whether to invest in the company. Lenders - To determine the ability to repay loans and interest. Suppliers - assess the ability to pay accounts receivable in full and on time. Customers - interested in the companys stability and ability to provide ongoing service and support Government - for tax assessment and policy decision-making Public - interested in the overall financial strength and stability of corporations Competitors - analyze performance and spot potential weaknesses. Analysts - journalists, researchers, and rating agencies use it for industry performance evaluation. Special interest groups - To assess social impact and lobby. Trade unions - analyze the companys ability to pay workers and meet future pay demands. 57 Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs Hence, since your reports have several users, you need to properly design and implement a strong accounting system that will enable you to build smooth relationships with stockholders and achieve your goal. 4.6. The accounting equation The basic accounting equation states that ASSET LIABILITIES OWNERS EQUITY The extended accounting equation is presented in the following figure Figure 9. The extended accounting equation Equity Retained Earnings Contributed Capital - Dividends Revenues - Expenses Common Stock Liabilities Assets Assets Assets are things of value owned by the business and expected to benefit the business in future years. They can be current or fixed. Current Assets are cash, cash equivalent, or assets held for collection, sale, or consumption within the entitys normal operating cycle or assets held for trading within the next 12 months. Examples include Cash Inventories Accounts receivables Fixed assetsnon-current assets last a long time. Examples include Buildings Furniture Equipment Machinery Motor vehicles Depreciation is the loss of value of an asset due to wear and tear. 58 Module Four Basics of Bookkeeping Liabilities Liabilities are debts owed to others. Examples include Debts owed to suppliers accounts payable and Debts owed to a bank or mortgage company bank loan payable and mortgage payable. They can be current or long-term. Current Liability Current liabilities are Debts that must be settled within the entitys normal operating cycle, Due within 12 months, Held for trading, and Not eligible for deferred payment beyond 12 months. Examples include Accruals, payables due Anything prepaid receivable Creditors people to whom you owe money Long-Term Liabilities They take longer than one year to pay off. Example Long-term bank loan. Owners equity refers to The value of assets remaining after deducting all liabilities Investments made by the owner to start the business Profits or losses earned through the operation of the business Revenueincome Revenue is the earnings from selling goods andor services to customers. Sources include Producing and selling goods Buying and selling goods Giving a service e.g., a taxi driver who provides transport Expense Expenses are the costs of operating a business, typically including rent, salaries, utilities, telephone, supplies, and advertising. It is money out of your business to generate revenue. Reasons include Materials or ingredients like fish and firewood for fish smoking, cloth for dressmaking, flour for bread baking. Services such as Transportation taxi, bus Market stall Electricity Rent 59 Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs Salary and wage If people are helping you in your business, they must be paid a salary. Replacement and repair of equipment and utensils You must keep separate funds to pay for expenses such as repairing a machine, replacing worn-out utensils, or unexpected costs. Profit Profit is the difference between revenues and expenses. Profit earned if revenues are more than expenses. Expenses greater than revenue result in a loss. Dear participants, assume you have your own business and list the types of assets, liabilities, revenue sources, and expenses. 4.7. Nature and Advantages of Tax Tax and Tax Management Brainstorm Dear participants, answer the following questions What is tax? Why should you pay taxes? How can you manage your tax payments? Tax is a mandatory fee or financial charge levied by any government to collect revenue for public use on an individual or an organization. 60 Module Four Basics of Bookkeeping Having a Tax Identification Number TIN While forming a business, it is required to have a Tax Identification Number TIN. It is a unique identification number assigned to businesses for tax purposes. Regardless of the nature of the business, obtaining a TIN would be necessary for several reasons 1. Tax Obligations Like any other business, the Coffee Hub must fulfill its tax obligations to the Ethiopian government. This includes filing tax returns, reporting income and expenses, and paying applicable taxes such as income tax, value-added tax VAT, or other relevant taxes. 2. Legal Compliance A business without a TIN could face legal issues and penalties. The TIN is an official identification number for tax authorities to track and monitor the businesss tax compliance. 3. Business Transactions A TIN enables the engagement of various business transactions. It may be required when opening a business bank account, entering into contracts with supp 4. Employee Payroll and Withholding Taxes If The Coffee Hub plans to hire employees, having a TIN is essential for payroll purposes. It allows the business to deduct and remit taxes from employee salaries, including income tax and social security contributions. 5. Access to Government Services A TIN may be required to access certain government services or benefits related to business operations, such as applying for permits and licenses or participating in government-sponsored programs. Hence, obtaining a TIN for a business would ensure compliance with tax regulations, facilitate business transactions, and enable the business to operate legally while fulfilling its tax obligations. Why Should Businesses Pay Tax? Taxes are paid to the government for several purposes, including 1. To fund public services Taxes finance essential public services such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, and national defense. 2. To redistribute wealth Taxes can transfer wealth from the wealthier members of society to the poorer ones, thereby reducing inequality. 3. To regulate the economy Taxes can influence economic behavior, such as promoting investment or consumption and reducing inflation. 4. To support social welfare programs Taxes can finance social welfare programs such as unemployment benefits and social security. 5. To pay off government debt Taxes can be used to pay off government debt and to ensure that the government can continue to borrow funds when needed. Dear participants, assume that you have your own business, and list the potential types of tax your company will pay and the tax category of your company. 61 Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs 4.8. How to Manage Taxe Payments Tax management is especially critical for micro and small enterprises, as they often have limited resources and may not have dedicated tax departments. The following are some tips on how to manage tax 1. Keep Accurate Records Use accounting software or hire a bookkeeper to manage your financial records. 2. Separate Business and Personal Finances Keep your personal and business finances separate to avoid confusion and ensure you only claim business expenses on your tax return. 3. Understand Tax Obligations Understand your tax obligations, including the types of taxes you must pay, filing deadlines, and payment schedules. 4. Take Advantage of Tax Deductions Identify all tax deductions and credits available to your business to minimize tax liability. For example, you may be able to deduct expenses related to office rent, salary, and equipment depreciation. 5. Use Online Tax Filing Consider using online tax filing services to simplify the tax filing process and avoid errors. 6. Seek Professional Advice Seek professional advice from a tax specialist or accountant to ensure compliance with tax laws and regulations and maximize tax savings. 7. Plan for Taxes Plan for tax payments in advance to avoid cash flow problems. Set aside funds for tax payments and make payments on time to avoid penalties and interest charges. 4.9. Summary Bookkeeping is the systematic process of recording and organizing financial transactions within a business. It involves maintaining accurate and up-to-date revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities records. It serves as the foundation for financial management and decision-making in companies. The advantages include providing a clear financial picture of the business, facilitating informed decision- making, ensuring compliance with tax regulations, assisting in budgeting and forecasting, and enabling accurate financial reporting. Basic accounting principles guide the practice of bookkeeping. These principles include the accrual basis, consistency, materiality, and double-entry bookkeeping. Adhering to these principles ensures financial reporting accuracy, consistency, and reliability. Key steps for effective bookkeeping involve maintaining the chart of accounts, recording transactions accurately, and preparing financial statements. These steps help to ensure the integrity of financial data and provide a solid foundation for financial analysis and reporting. The basic accounting equation Assets Liabilities Equity is the foundation for double-entry bookkeeping. It ensures that the financial records remain balanced and provides a framework for analyzing the impact of transactions on assets, liabilities, and equity. Financial reports are prepared to provide relevant and reliable financial information to various stakeholders such as investors, creditors, and management. Users of financial reports rely on this information to make informed decisions, assess the financial performance and position of the business, and evaluate its ability to meet obligations. Tax and tax management involve understanding tax regulations, planning tax strategies, and ensuring compliance. Effective tax management helps businesses minimize tax liabilities, take advantage of available deductions and credits, and meet their tax obligations. 62 Module Four Basics of Bookkeeping Based on sound accounting principles, bookkeeping is vital in maintaining financial records, facilitating decision-making, and providing stakeholders with accurate and reliable financial information. Effective bookkeeping practices contribute to businesses financial success and sustainability. 4.10.

Reasons for savings Saving goals Methods of saving Important factors for deciding where to save Making a savings plan Welcome to Module Five. In this module, you will learn the importance of savings, how and where to save, and how to make a savings plan. The objective is to present the various savings mechanisms, their advantages and disadvantages, and enable you to establish linkages between savings goals and savings products. 65 Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs 5.1. What are Savings? Brainstorm Dear participants, in groups discuss what savings are and why people save. Saving refers to money left over after income is spent on the consumption of goods and services. It is putting aside part of your current earnings for future use. It is not done once but over a period of time. A key to good money management, savings help individuals and households manage risk, deal with emergencies, smoothen income, build assets, and meet financial goals. 5.2. Reasons for Savings There are many reasons to save, and most of the reasons fall into one of the following three categories 1. For unexpected life cycle events emergencies, e.g., accidents, health problems, fires, floods, landslides, family illnesses, etc. Without savings, we would have to borrow money to pay for these expenses, creating an added financial and emotional burden. 2. For expected life cycle events such as marriage, education for the family, food, etc. These needs require additional money. 3. To achieve long-term goals and build assets, such as building or buying a house, starting a business, etc. An asset is something that you own and has long-term value. An asset can be sold and converted to money if the need arises. Some assets, such as a house, can also generate income for us if we rent it out. Buying these assets that could provide us with long- term security would be difficult without savings. On the other hand, economist Keynes 1936 distinguished eight motives for saving 1. Pre-cautionary motive refers to building up a reserve against unforeseen contingencies. 2. Independence motive refers to enjoying a sense of independence and the power to do things, though without a clear idea or definite intention of a specific action. 3. Life-cycle motive refers to providing for an anticipated future relationship between the income and the needs of the individual. 4. Intertemporal substitution motive refers to enjoying interest and appreciation. 5. Improvement motive refers to enjoying a gradually increasing expenditure. 6. Enterprise motive refers to securing the required resources for carrying out speculative or business activity by investing money when available and possible. 7. Avarice motive refers to satisfying pure miserableness, i.e., unreasonable but insistent inhibitions against acts of expenditure. It is related to being miserly, which assumes that there are enough resources left after the other motives have been satisfied. 8. Bequest motive refers to leaving behind a large inheritance to bequeath a fortune. 66 Module Five Savings The figure below presents the hierarchal saving motives of the eight items Avarice Pride Calculation Independence Enterprise Foresight Improvement UncertainityPrecautionsEmergency Hierarchical Structure of Saving Motives Important In general, saving is important because it helps us to ensure our long-term health, security, happiness, and stability. Dear participants Use your imagination to complete the following table by listing the main reasons for Hana and Kuma. 67 Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs Unexpected life cycle events emergencies Expected life cycle events Building assets Other reasons 5.3. Savings Goals Saving goals can be short-term or long-term. Short-term goals, such as paying off school fees, will be reached in less than one year. Long-term goals will take over a year to reach, e.g., home improvements or buying a house. Dear participants Review the goals in the above activity and identify the short- term and long-term goals. 68 Module Five Savings 5.4. Ways of Saving Your Money Hana and Kuma are discussing with their close friends, Meseret and Yohannes, about where they should save the money earned by The Coffee Hub. Hana does not trust anyone to manage her money, and she prefers to keep it in a hiding place in her house. Meseret advises them to keep their savings in a savings account at a microfinance institution. This way, they can earn interest and might bring an opportunity to request a loan after they reach deposit a certain amount. Yohannes has a different idea and advises them to join an ekub group, where they and the other members set aside a small amount of money each week. Dear participants What do you think regarding the saving methods suggested by the characters above? Are they formal or informal? What saving methods do you use? Dear participants You can choose to save through formal, semi-formal, or informal institutions and in the form of cash or non-cash. Non-cash forms of saving are assets, such as land or animals, that can quickly and easily be converted to cash, and generally retain their value. Land is less liquid than animals. Informal savings include saving cash at home, which keeps your cash accessible and allows you to avoid the transaction costs associated with saving at formal saving institutions. This form of informal savings has two significant disadvantages the temptation to spend the money and the risk of theft. You need strong discipline to avoid spending these savings yourself and deny the pleas of other family members. Semi-formal savings encompass group savings mechanisms, including savings associations, village savings and loan associations, solidarity groups, and self-help groups. The advantage of associations is that each member receives a lump sum of money at one time, with no loan or interest payments. 69 Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs Formal savings involve financial institutions, including banks, credit institutions, cooperatives, or microfinance institutions, and offer another widely used option for saving cash. Savings in formal financial institutions are generally safe and earn interest. They offer a range of savings accounts tailored to different financial needs. However, the requirements for opening and maintaining an account, such as minimum deposits, user fees, and withdrawal requirements, can be costly. 5.5. Important Factors for Deciding Where to Save Brainstorm In deciding where to save, what factors do you recommend Hana and Kuma to consider? After the discussion, you can summarize their suggestions using the following ideas Deposit requirements. Is there a minimum deposit required to open the account? Is there a minimum balance required to keep the account open? Are small deposits accepted? Can variable sums be deposited? Can deposits be made frequently? What paperwork is required? Terms of use. Is the savings program compulsory or voluntary? Do you have to commit to saving a set amount at regular intervals or over a certain time period? Are there rules about how much you must deposit and when? Are there rules about how much you are allowed to withdraw and when? Can you withdraw the money at any time without penalty? Cost. What fees are charged for deposits, withdrawals, or passbooks? Some forms of saving may lose value during inflation or economic instability. You need to consider such costs even though they do not involve payment of actual fees. AccessEase of use. Is the account convenient? What are the institutions hours of operation? Is it open at convenient times? How far is the institution from your home or workplace? Are transactions quick and confidential? What is the quality of customer service? Is the atmosphere comfortable and friendly? Are there long lines at the teller windows? Is the information on the account easily available? Does it provide statements? Are they easy to understand? Are the application procedures easy to follow? Does it have an ATM network? Safety. What is the institutions reputation? Does it have insurance or other guarantees to safeguard funds? Are telephone or electronic transactions safe? Is the bank or its branch located in a safe neighborhood location? Liquidity. How easy is it to withdraw funds from the account? Can the full amount be withdrawn? Are fees charged if the funds are withdrawn before a specified date? Interest. Will your savings earn interest? If so, how much? How and when is the interest paid? What is the difference in interest rates earned across different types of savings products or plans? 70 Module Five Savings Important Choose to save in an institution that is easy to reach and work with. The institutions you choose should at least Be safe and secure Be easily accessible Have an easy process for opening an account Have good interest earned on savings Have little or no charges on your account make sure that your monthly interest is more than the monthly charges and Value and treat you well as a client. 5.6. Making a Savings Plan A savings plan is critical for managing money to meet short- or long-term financial goals. To make a savings plan, follow the following steps 1. Set savings goals. 2. Figure out how much you need to save over what period of time to meet your savings goals. Set a savings target. 3. Figure out how much you are earning over this period of time, the regularity or irregularity of your earnings, and how much you can expect to save regularly. 4. Identify which expense you can cut back for example, video rental, alcohol, or tea breaks and reallocate this amount to your savings. 5. Decide where you will save. Identify places to save, available savings products, and their pros and cons. 6. Plan how much and how often you will save. For example, you could put a specific amount aside in an envelope when you are paid or at the end of each business day and keep it in a safe place until you can take it to the bank. Go to the bank on a set day of the week or month. If you are a wage earner and your employer is linked to a bank, consider a deduction from your paycheck that is automatically deposited into your savings account. 7. Keep track of your savings. Monitor progress towards your saving target regularly by checking the amount you have saved and how close you are to your goal. Check bank statements, passbooks, or other sources of information on your savings. 71 Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs Important To save, we must spend less than we earn. We must save regularly, with discipline, and have objectives it is a slow and gradual process but rewarding. No savings means less security, difficulties meeting social obligations and the unexpected, less well-being, and a more precarious situation in old age. 5.7. Summary Saving is the practice of putting aside part of your current earnings for future use. It is not done once but over a period of time. You may have different reasons to save, summarized as unexpected life cycle events emergencies, expected life cycle events, and to achieve long-term goals and build assets. Savings goals can be short-term or long-term. Having a savings plan for managing money to meet short- or long-term financial goals is important. In deciding where to save, some factors to consider are safety, interest, liquidity, service charge, and accessibility. 72 Module Five Savings 5.8.

Definition of Investment Investment is the purchase of goods not consumed today but used in the future to create wealth and appreciation. An asset or item purchased with the hope that it will generate income or appreciation in the future is an investment. Types of investment Business It includes a business set up for production, processing, and exportation. Common businesses include beauty salons, restaurants, retail and wholesale shops, etc. Farming Ethiopia has an agricultural economy, and most investments are carried out in this sector. Opportunities are available for investment in production, processing, and exportation, e.g., in poultry, flowering, crop production, fruit farming, processing and packaging, or setting up a vegetable stall in the market. Real Asset Property or real estate investment is good business, especially when the market is right. Stocks Shares A share is an instrument that represents part ownership of a company. When you invest in shares, you become a shareholder in the company and are entitled to dividends from the companys profits. Fixed Deposit or Certificate of Deposit This is an investment where you lend your money to a financial institution and benefit from the interest that accrues on the money. This gives you a fixed amount of interest, which may be paid periodically over the life of the investment or cumulatively at the end.

Dear participants, in groups discuss what it really means and why they shouldnt put all their eggs in one basket? Dear participants Every investment comes with a risk. There is a risk of losing money, getting stolen, mismanaged, destroyed, or damaged. Monitor your investments closely to make sure they are not losing money and time. Diversification is often cited as one of the key strategies to successful investing. It involves spreading your money across a number of investments instead of putting all of it in one stock or investment vehicle. The idea is to mitigate the risk of losing all or a significant portion of your money in a single investment. The old adage best illustrates this Dont put all your eggs in one basket. If you put all your eggs in one basket and you drop that basket, all the eggs will be broken. But if you place some eggs in Basket A, some in Basket B, and a few in Basket C, you will still have eggs in Basket B and C should you drop Basket A and break all the eggs. 78 Module Six Investment The baskets represent different investment vehicles, each with its own risks and reacting differently to any given economic and market condition. Hence, by putting our money the eggs into different investments, were spreading these risks across multiple investments. Thus, with diversification, you reduce risk by spreading it across different types of investments. There are various ways you can diversify your investments across different companies, sectors, and even countries and well cover them here. But before we do, its important to understand the risks that diversification can reduce. 6.4. Summary Investment is putting money into a productive activity. The purpose is to multiply what you have today in the future. Investment means foregoing todays consumption for an activity that will bring you more income in the future. Before you venture into any business, you must make a feasibility study or determine whether its profitable. Some factors in deciding where to invest are your investment goals, cost, income potential, knowledge and skills on how this investment works, and risks. Diversifying investments helps to mitigate the risk by spreading across several investments instead of putting all of it in one stock or investment vehicle. 79 Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs 6.5.

Sharia-Compliant Financing Sharia-compliant financing, also known as Islamic financing, follows the principles of Islamic law Sharia. In Ethiopia, options are available for Sharia-compliant financing for micro and small enterprises. Here are some possibilities to consider a. Islamic Banking Services in Conventional Banks Some conventional banks in Ethiopia may have Islamic banking services or divisions that offer Sharia-compliant financial products. Inquire with major banks to see if they have such options available. For example, the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia has an Islamic banking service. b. Dedicated branches Besides dedicated windows, traditional banks have a dedicated branch that offers Sheria-compliant financing. c. Dedicated Islamic Banks In addition to Sharia-compliant windows, Ethiopia has dedicated Islamic banks that operate exclusively based on Islamic finance principles. These banks were established to provide Sharia-compliant financial services to customers who prefer Islamic banking products and services. They operate with the approval and oversight of the regulatory authorities. 7.3.1. Summary of the key difference between sharia-compliant finance and conventional finance Sharia-compliant finance adheres to the principles of Islamic law, which prohibits interest riba, speculation gharar, and investment in certain industries like alcohol, gambling, and pork. Instead, Sharia-compliant instruments use profit-and- loss sharing, leasing, and equity-based financing. Conventional finance, on the other hand, is based on interest-bearing loans, derivatives, and investments in a broader range of industries. Sharia-compliant finance emphasizes ethical, socially responsible investing, while conventional finance is primarily focused on maximizing financial returns. The legal and regulatory frameworks for Sharia-compliant finance differ from those of conventional finance. 84 Module Seven Sources of Finance Outline of the key differences between Sharia- compliant finance and conventional finance Sharia-Compliant Finance Basis Grounded in Islamic principles and Sharia law. Interest Riba Strictly prohibits the charging or receipt of interest Riba as it is considered usury. Risk-sharing Emphasizes risk-sharing between the financier and the borrowerentrepreneur. Asset-Backed Financing must be tied to real economic assets or activities, not purely speculative. Prohibited Activities Avoids financing activities deemed prohibited under Sharia, such as alcohol, gambling, and other haram industries. Profit-Loss Sharing Uses profit-loss sharing models like Mudarabah and Musharakah rather than fixed-return loans. Transparency Requires high levels of transparency and disclosure. Conventional Finance Basis Based on secular, capitalist principles. Interest Riba Interest-based lending and borrowing is the foundation of conventional finance. Risk Transfer Focuses on transferring risk from the lender to the borrower. Asset-Backed Financing does not necessarily require an underlying asset. Permitted Activities Allows financing for a wide range of industries, including those prohibited in Sharia-compliant finance. Fixed Returns Uses debt-based instruments like loans, bonds, and mortgages that provide fixed returns. Transparency Disclosure requirements may be less stringent compared to Sharia-compliant finance. Note Sharia-compliant financing sources can also be available through microfinance institutions and other financial modalities in Ethiopia. Conducting thorough research with due diligence and seeking professional advice when considering Sharia-compliant financing options is advisable. Consult with Islamic finance experts, legal advisors, or financial institutions experienced in Sharia-compliant practices to better understand each financing options terms, requirements, and implications. Generally, the common sources of finance for business are from owners, loans debt, and lease financing. The following section explains the nature and advantages of debit and lease financing. 85 Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs 7.4. Why debt financing? Brainstorm Dear participants do you think debt financing is advantageous? Debt financing refers to raising capital by borrowing money from a lender to be repaid at a future date. In Ethiopia, it is possible to secure a loan using movable properties as collateral. These loans, known as asset-based loans or chattel mortgages, allow businesses to leverage their movable assets to obtain financing. Debt financing can have the following advantages 1. Access to Capital Debt financing provides MSMEs immediate access to the necessary capital to establish. 2. Business Expansion With debt financing, businesses can pursue expansion opportunities more readily. Credit availability allows for faster growth and scalability for opening additional locations, introducing new product offerings, or investing in marketing and promotions. 3. Flexibility in Use of Funds The Coffee Hub can allocate the borrowed funds as needed. Hana and Kuma can use the credit to purchase equipment, hire skilled staff, renovate the premises, invest in technology, or undertake other initiatives that enhance their value proposition and customer experience. 4. Retain Ownership and Profits Unlike equity financing, debt financing does not dilute ownership. Hana and Kuma can control their business fully and retain all profits. This allows them to reap the rewards of their hard work and maintain their vision for The Coffee Hub. 5. Building Credit History Timely repayment of debt obligations helps The Coffee Hub establish a positive credit history. This can benefit future financing needs, as a strong credit profile increases the likelihood of obtaining favorable terms and conditions for potential loans or credit facilities. 6. Potential Cost Savings Depending on prevailing interest rates and the founders creditworthiness, debt financing may offer lower costs than other financing options. Suppose Hana and Kuma can secure a loan with favorable interest rates. In that case, it can result in cost savings and improved profitability for The Coffee Hub. 7. Investor Independence Debt financing allows the business to operate independently without interference from external investors. The founders can make business decisions without input from shareholders or equity partners, maintaining their autonomy and strategic direction. While debt financing offers numerous advantages, it is crucial for businesses to carefully evaluate their repayment capabilities, interest rates, and associated risks. They should ensure that the business generates sufficient cash flow to meet debt obligations and avoid potential default. Additionally, it is essential to balance debt and equity financing to prevent excessive leverage and maintain financial stability. Seeking professional advice from financial experts or consultants can aid in making informed decisions that align with specific business needs and goals. 86 Module Seven Sources of Finance 7.5.

Equb is a form of informal finance where a group of people pools together money regularly, typically weekly or monthly. The money is then given to one group member in rotation until everyone has received their share. It can finance various expenses, such as starting a small business, purchasing household items, buying land, or covering medical expenses. Members typically trust each other and have a shared goal. In many cases, there is no formal contract or written agreement but rather a verbal agreement and a spirit of trust and cooperation that binds the members together. The process involves regular meetings among members, where the money is collected, and the recipient of the funds is chosen. Members agree on rules regarding the duration of the monetary amount and the order of receiving the money. For example, In an 8-member Equb, each member might contribute ETB 1000 per month, for a total of ETB 8,000. The Equb would last eight months, and each member would receive ETB 8,000. 4.

However, formal financial services are recommended to businesses because of the above-listed advantages.

Regulated institutions like commercial banks, microfinance institutions, cooperative banks, insurance companies, venture capital providers, leasing companies, and fintech companies as formal financial services. They offer products such as loans, investments, insurance, and payment services. It contributes a lot to business and the country at large. Informal financial services refer to options provided through personal relationships, such as funds from friendsfamily, and community-based groups like equb and idir. They are flexible, require little paperwork, and build social capital. However, interest rates are often higher, amounts that can be borrowed are smaller, and there is a risk of damaging personal relationships or social ties. For new or small businesses, the appropriate source of finance depends on needs, risk, eligibility, and ownership preferences. Formal and informal options may be combined. Informal finance can be sustainable, as it leverages community relationships and generates social and financial benefits. However, formal finance may provide lower costs and higher amounts of capital as a business develops a track record and needs to scale. Financial services, both formal and informal, play an essential role in facilitating economic activity. Access to affordable financial services can help empower individuals and support entrepreneurship 100 Module Eight Financial Services by providing the means to build assets, make productive investments, and better manage financial risks. An inclusive financial system that leverages formal and informal options may be optimal for serving the needs of diverse populations. Finally, understanding the range of financial services, their characteristics, and their advantages and disadvantages can help you make informed choices about how to fund and support your financial and business goals. For those with limited access, community-based informal services provide a social safety net and pathways to build credit and connect with formal financial institutions. 8.11.

There are two types of channels. These are a. Self-service channel It refers to a channel available to Hana and Kuma without any other human interaction i.e., Hana and Kuma dont need an agent or a bank staff involved. Some examples are Internet banking, mobile banking, and self-service terminals provided by financial institutions. a. Over-the-counter channel This channel requires Hana and Kuma to interact with either a staff member or thirdparty agent, merchant to transact. e.g., agency banking, and extension services. Dear participants The most commonly used channels are introduced below, along with additional information on how and who can use these channels. As shown below, channels can be self-service or over-the- counter, whereby the customer e.g., Hana and Kuma interacts with staff or third-party representatives such as agents or merchants. Commonly used channels in digital finance Channel Name Type of Channel Access Point Functions offered by the Channel ATM Self-service ATM Cash out, balance inquiry, payments, cash deposit Internet banking Self-service Computer, phone, tablet, kiosk inquiries, transfers, payments Agent banking OTC Third-party agent, merchant, phone, POS, mobile Cash in, cash out, payments, sell value add service, content sales, bill payment 106 Module Nine Digital Financial Services Extension services, field staff, mini branch, branch on wheels OTC Bank staff loan officer, POS, mobile Account opening, cash in, cash out, loan applications, Mobile banking Self-service Phone inquiries, transfers, Payments E-wallet m-wallets, prepaid cards, store cards Self-service OTC Phone, computer, merchant, kiosk, ATM, agent, card Cash in, cash out, payments, transfers Call center OTC Phone, customer service inquiries, transfers, payments 9.5.

The biggest challenge that persists and needs to be addressed in building Ethiopias Digital Financial Services DFS ecosystem is its comparatively low penetration levels compared to other least-developed countries in the East and Southern Africa Regions UNCDF, 20221. This is mainly due to the low performance of the mobile money environment, which is the primary driver of accessing and using digital financial services in the region. Digital finance poses traditional risks, such as fraud or over-indebtedness, and heightens new risks to business. The main challenges of digital financial services are summarized in the figure below Challenges of Digital Finance in Ethiopia Low internet speeds, connectivity, and usage Lack of access to digital ﬁnancial technologies e.g., low mobile handset ownership Fraud and security issues Low level lack of digital literacy 1 UNCDF, 2022. Building Ethiopias Digital Financial Services Ecosystem Barriers and Opportunities 113 Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs Some other challenges Some other challenges 1. Risk of using digital financial services Security and privacy risks for digital services like mobile banking can stop individuals and businesses from using DFS. 2. Less information about the advantages of DFS Lack of proper information about the advantages of DFS hinders individuals and businesses from using DFS. 3.

Dear participants, Risk awareness is a crucial element in financial education. Many individuals have a low level of awareness of the risks they face and lack the requisite knowledge of risk management tools. Lets start with self-assessment to see where you are in understanding risk and the importance of risk management. Read each statement below and select the number that corresponds with your level of confidence, level 1 least to 4 most. There are no wrong answers. 1. I can identify the common risks associated with a small business. 1 2 3 4 2. I can identify the external and internal factors that affect risk for a small business. 1 2 3 4 3.

I can implement, monitor, and evaluate a risk management plan for a small business. 1 2 3 4 10.2. Understanding Risk Risk is the possibility of loss or injury. Not all risks come from negative sources. Risks may come from positive sources or opportunities, such as expansion and growth, which carry a certain level of risk. 10.3. Types of risk Your business is subject to internal risks weaknesses and external risks threats. Generally, you can control most, if not all, internal risks once you identify them. However, external risks may be entirely out of your control. While you have almost total control over internal risks and can put measures and systems in place to reduce or eliminate their impact, a host of external risks can impact your business, often without warning. This, of course, can include a major disaster or even a global pandemic, as weve learned all too well in recent years. 120 Module Ten Risk Management and Insurance Internal risks External Risks Human Risks The human component of your business is a natural source of risk. Here are just a few of the risks humans can pose Illness or death A business owner or a leadership team member may fall ill and not be able to work for months. Their death would pose an even greater risk to the organization.risks to your business. Theft and fraud Most businesses want an honest workforce, but employee theft and employee fraud are significant risks to your business. Low employee morale Unhappy employees can cost you money through negligence or willful acts. For example, an employee who forgets to place an order for inventory can risk your sales because backorders lead to cancellations. Market and Competition Risks The market itself can expose a small business to risk. This can include a new competitor opening across the street, the wholesale cost of goods skyrocketing, pricing pressures, supply chain disruptions, and vendor changes. Key employees may leave you for your competitor, taking valuable and once-loyal customers with them. Worse, they can take some of your trade secrets with them if you havent properly protected them. Rent increases can suddenly rise in a highly competitive market. The cost of utilities can also increase risk. Both may require you to increase prices, which can adversely affect sales. Consumer patterns may shift unexpectedly. Customers can be fickle, chasing the latest trends or fashions even in the best of times. Shifts in popular culture can add risk to your operations and ability to operate profitably. Equipment and Information Technology Risks Downtime of computer systems, machinery, or vehicles can cost you a substantial amount of money. Creating a replacement schedule for these assets can help you avoid downtime or costly repairs or support. The same can be said for machinery parts that need to be replaced periodically due to wear and tear. Business Environment Risks What happens around your business can significantly affect your business. This can include federal, state, county, and city laws and ordinances or zoning changes. New health and safety protocols can be introduced, or the city can increase its inspection cycles. 121 Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs Physical Risks Fire, flood, power outages, storms, and other crises can profoundly affect your operations. As you consider risk, you want to inspect your facilities and offices for potential risks. Adding fire suppression systems, fire extinguishers, flood mitigation systems and generators can help you reduce the chance these disruptions occur and minimize the damage they can do to your business. Youll also want to survey your business operations to reduce the possibility of work-related injuries. Workplace injuries can cause a loss of productivity and open your business to lawsuits. Financial Risks Cash flow is the lifeblood of your business. Unexpected expenses or reduced revenue can put your business at risk, as can the loss of a credit line. A risk management plan should be developed to address these risks to your bottom line. Even new financing can create added risk in the form of additional debt, appraisal, and closing costs, and tying up business assets as loan collateral. Dear particiapnts, Dear participants, which one of the above risks are relevant to The Coffee Hub? Brainstorm What are some examples of things you do to protect yourself, your family, or your home from risks? 122 Module Ten Risk Management and Insurance 10.4. Risk Management Process Risk management is a process that identifies loss exposures faced by an organization and selects the most appropriate techniques for treating such exposures. The risk management process involves four steps Step 1 Identify potential losses identify Step 2 Evaluate potential losses assess Step 3 Select the appropriate techniques for treating loss exposure treat Step 4 Implement and administer the program monitor and report. 10.4.1. Risk Identification The first step in the risk management process is to identify all major and minor loss exposures. This step involves a painstaking analysis of all potential losses. Unless the sources of possible losses are recognized, it is impossible to consciously choose appropriate, efficient methods for dealing with those losses should they occur. Some potential sources of risk could be related to the following exposures Property loss Business income loss Human resources Liability risks 10.4.2. Risk Measurement Risk Evaluation The second step in the risk management process is to evaluate and measure the impact of losses on the firm. This step involves the estimation of the potential frequency and severity of loss. Loss frequency refers to the probable number of losses that may occur during a given period of time. Loss severity refers to the probable size of the losses that may occur. STEP 1 IDENTIFY STEP 3 TREAT STEP 2 ASSESS STEP 4 MONITOR REPORT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS 123 Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs 10.4.3. Selection of an Appropriate Technique After identifying and evaluating risk exposures, systematic consideration can be given to alternative methods for managing each exposure. The four basic methods available to handling risks are Risk avoidance, Loss control, Risk retention, and Risk transfer. Avoidance means never acquiring a certain loss exposure or abandoning an existing loss exposure. Risk avoidance is a conscious decision to expose oneself or ones firm to a particular risk of loss. In this way, risk avoidance can be said to decrease ones chance of loss to zero. For example, a pharmaceutical firm that markets a drug with dangerous side effects can withdraw the drug from the market. Risk avoidances major advantage is that the loss chance is reduced to zero if the loss exposure is never acquired. In addition, if an existing loss exposure is abandoned, the chance of loss is reduced or eliminated because the activity or product that could produce a loss has been abandoned. Avoidance, however, has two major disadvantages first, the firm may be unable to avoid all losses. For example, a company may be unable to avoid a key executives premature death. Second, it may not be feasible or practical to avoid the exposure. A paint factory can avoid losses arising from the production of paint. Without paint production, however, the firm will not be in business. When particular lossesrisks cannot be avoided, actions may be taken to reduce the associated losses. This method of dealing with risk is known as loss control. It differs from risk avoidance because the firm or individual still engages in operations that give rise to particular risks. Rather than abandoning specific activities, loss control involves making conscious decisions regarding the manner in which those activities will be conducted. Common goals are either to reduce the probability or cost of losses. Retention means that the firm retains part or all of the losses that can result from a given loss. Retention can be active planned or passive unplanned. Active risk retention means the firm is aware of the loss exposure and plans to retain part or all of it, such as automobile crash losses to a fleet of company cars. Passive risk retention, however, is the failure to identify a loss exposure, or failure to act or forgetting to act. For example, a risk manager may fail to identify all company assets that could be damaged in an earthquake. Risk transfer is the final risk management tool, which involves payments by one party the transferor to another the transferee or risk bearer. The transferee agrees to assume a risk that the transferor desires to escape. Sometimes, the degree of risk is reduced through the transfer process because the transferee may be better positioned to use the law of large numbers to predict losses. In other cases, the degree of risk remains the same and is merely shifted from the transferor to the transferee for a price. Four forms of risk transfer are hold-harmless agreements, incorporation, hedging, and insurance. Hold-Harmless Agreements Provisions inserted into many different kinds of contracts can transfer responsibility for some types of losses to a party different than the one that would otherwise bear it. Such provisions are called hold-harmless agreements or sometimes indemnity agreements. Incorporation Through this act of incorporation, a firm transfers to its creditors the risk that it might not have sufficient assets to pay for losses and other debts. Personal assets of the owners cannot be attached to help pay for business losses, as can be the case with sole proprietorships and partnerships. 124 Module Ten Risk Management and Insurance Hedging This involves the transfer of speculative risk. It is a business transaction in which the risk of price fluctuations is transferred to a third party known as a speculator. 10.5. Insurance How Does It Work? Insurance is one of the most important parts of your risk management plan. Individuals can transfer their personal risk to a third partythe insurance company by purchasing insurance. Insurance is an arrangement in which an insurance company compensates a person or a company for a specified loss caused by e.g., weather bad season, accident, fire, and death. In such an arrangement, an insured party pays an agreed amount of money premium in advance to be compensated in case the event happens. 125 Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs 10.6. Types of Insurance Life insurance The main purpose of life insurance is to insure against loss of income due to death. It can also be used for retirement planning and investing. It is the one kind of insurance you pay for, but only others benefit from it. Except in rare cases, the purpose of life insurance is to provide security for others at the time of your death. Health insurance Also called medical insurance, it helps protect you and your family from expensive or unexpected healthcare-related expenses. It is designed to estimate your overall risk of health-related expenses and supplement your cost of care, including doctors appointments, hospitalization, prescriptions, and other similar costs. Disability insurance Another type of medical coverage is disability income insurance, which pays part of your income if you become ill or injured and need an extended period to recover or can no longer work. Property and liability insurance Property may be exposed to various dangers fire, theft, and damage by persons whether accidental or carelessness. It consists of those forms of insurance designed to protect against losses resulting from damage to or loss of property and losses resulting from legal liability. 126 Module Ten Risk Management and Insurance Important Message Insurance is generally considered a valuable risk management tool because it allows a third party the insurance company to assume part of your risk and your costs. However, it can become expensive if you buy coverage you do not need or pay more than you should for the premium. 10.7. Steps in Acquiring an Insurance Policy Dear particiapnts, what are the main steps to consider for Hana and Kuma to purchase an insurance policy ? Generally, Hana and Kuma can go through the following steps 1. Determine insurance needs Assess the specific requirements to identify the type of insurance coverage they need, such as health, property, or business insurance. Understand the available coverage options, limits, and specific requirements associated with their desired insurance type. 2. Research insurance providers Conduct research and compare different insurance providers to find one that offers the coverage they need at a competitive price. Consider factors like their reputation, customer reviews, financial stability, and the range of insurance products they offer. 3. Contact insurance companies Contact the insurance providers they have shortlisted. This can be done via phone, email, or their website. Engage in conversations and gather information about the available policies. 4. Obtain insurance quotes Provide the necessary information to the insurance provider to receive insurance quotes. This typically involves sharing personal details, property information if applicable, and other relevant information specific to their insurance requirements. Based on this information, the provider will offer a quote that outlines the coverage and premium amount. 5. Review policy details Examine the policys details thoroughly, including coverage, exclusions, deductibles, terms, and conditions. Before proceeding, ensure that the policy aligns with their needs and that they understand its terms comprehensively. 6. Complete application forms If they decide to move forward with a specific insurance provider, they must complete them. These forms usually require personal information, details about the insured property or assets, and any additional information specific to the type of insurance they are applying for. 7. Submit required documents Collect and submit any supporting documents requested by the insurance provider. These may include identification documents, proof of ownership, or any other documents necessary for processing their application. 8. Payment and policy issuance Make the premium payment as the insurance provider specifies. Review the policy documents thoroughly and retain a copy for your records. 127 Financial Education for the Youth and MSMEs 10.8. Retirement Plan Dear participants, What does it mean to plan for old age retirement? ብር Planning for Old AgeRetirement Retirement planning is the process of determining retirement income goals and the actions and decisions necessary to achieve those goals.

Summary Risk is the possibility of loss or injury. Not all risks come from negative sources. Risks may come from positive sources or opportunities, such as expansion and growth, which can have a certain level of risk. Risks can be classified as internal risks weaknesses and external risks threats. Generally, you can control most, if not all, internal risks once you identify them.
