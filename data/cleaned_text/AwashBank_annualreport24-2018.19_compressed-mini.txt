ANNUAL REPORT 201819 1 O n behalf of the Board of Directors of Awash Bank and on my own behalf, I welcome you all to the 24th Awash Banks Shareholders Annual General Meeting AGM of the FY 201819. I would also like to congratulate our respected Shareholders, esteemed Customers and concerned Stakeholders on your presence, continued trust, and patronage extended to the Bank all the years which enabled Awash Bank AB to register amazing results in all spheres of its operational activities and remain the leading private bank over the years. The FY 201819 was a mix of both opportunities and challenges to the banking industry. The opportunities were the political reforms made and the challenges were the compliance requirements at national and international levels, relatively elevated inflation, tighter, though recently relaxed, regulatory framework, political instability in some parts of the country and the stiff competition in the banking industry. Despite the challenges, however, by exploiting the opportunities withstanding the constraints, Awash Bank operated commendably and once again has recorded a laudable performance and unique result of its kind during the FY 201819. Not only this, the Financial Year 201819 was a year of success in that the Banks achievement was by far greater than that of the cascaded annual plan to be implemented on the third year of the ten years strategic journey of Transforming AB Vision 2025 Project. The 24th Annual General Meeting AGM of Shareholders of Awash Bank is historical in that it is being conducted while the two BOARD CHAIRMANS MESSAGE Tabor Wami Chairman, Board of Directors Prosper with the Leading Private Bank! ANNUAL REPORT 201819 2 Sister Companies, Awash Bank and Awash Insurance, are celebrating their Silver Jubilee. It is worth mentioning that both companies have played a great role in contributing to the development of private banks and private insurance companies in the country. Our Bank, despite a stiff competition, has shown a continued progress in building a stronger and safer Bank that is capable of delivering improved returns for its Shareholders over the years. In recent years, the Bank has increased its income, earning per share and dividend paid out with a track record of creating shareholders value. A milestone performance was recorded in all spheres of operations including, Deposits, Loans and Advances, Income, Branch Networks and above all Gross Profit. The major operational activities such as customer Deposits, Loans and Advances, Income and Gross Profit during the year grew by 36, 51, 49 and 70, respectively, as compared to same period of last year. Foreign currency earned during the year was incredibly high reaching USD 918,873,000 and a growth of 55 was recorded as compared to the preceding year. The efforts exerted in resource mobilization activities and in attracting the Diaspora Communities and the NGOs for foreign currency generation are worth mentioning at this point. Total asset of the Bank has reached Birr 74.6 Billion indicating a growth of 35 as compared to last years achievement. The performance achieved were the results of rigorous efforts of the Board, the Management and the entire staff joining hand-in-hand. In addition, the strategy followed by the Bank and the Business Operating Model practiced since the launching of the Transforming AB Vision 2025 Project have contributed and also proved to take the Bank a step forward to hit its target of becoming one of the Top Ten East African Private Banks by the year 2025. Awash Bank has also registered inspiring results on projects on hand including IT projects and the construction of own buildings. With regard to the IT projects, AB has embarked on delivering vendor related and in-house developed information technology solutions. Continuing on its journey of innovation and customer excellence, the Bank has completed the project work and started operations with the vendor related IT projects such as Enterprise Service Bus ESB, Customer Relationship Management CRM and the Contact Center CC solutions during the year under review. Other IT projects like Essence Core Upgrade and IFB System, Trade Innovation TI Upgrade and the Procurement of own Switch Solutions are under process. Among in-house developed software projects, Leave Management System, Training Management System, Job Application System, Claim Ticket Origination System, Pin and Card Management System, Performance Evaluation and Employee Service Management Systems were completed during the fiscal year and some of them are under implementation. With regard to the performances of the digital channels, encouraging results were achieved in the use of ATMs and POS terminals, Mobile Banking and Internet Banking services. The achievements in terms of the ATM Cards issued, number of M-Wallet, Internet subscribers and the number of Agents recruited during the year have shown a growth of 35,96,220 and 200, respectively, as compared to last year same period. The Banks effort to put its foot print in the utilization of the ATM terminals in all of its branches with an objective of providing efficient services to its customers is encouraging. In addition, the introduction of different digital technologies by the Bank had also helped customers to get the banking services at their doors. The need to strengthen the fixed assets of the Bank has continued by the construction of own buildings at different parts of the Prosper with the Leading Private Bank! ANNUAL REPORT 201819 3 strategic commitments and create value for its shareholders as well as the communities at large. I am confident that both the incoming Board and the Banks Management shall as before combine their skills and energies and strive to register yet another new glimmering success with mutual trust between the Bank and its clients and thereby maintain ABs leading position amongst the private banks of the country. The Board also believes that the introduction of IFRS, a new financial reporting standard, would help promote the image, recognition and reputation of the Bank at a global level. Before concluding, on behalf of the Board, I would like to once again, extend my genuine gratitude to ABs shareholders, customers, business partners and other stakeholders for their indispensable support and trust. My appreciation goes to ABs Management Team and all employees for their dedicated services and hard work to their Bank in delivering commendable results and enabling the Bank to drive a step forward. I would also like to thank my fellow Board of Directors for their concerted efforts and insights throughout the year and providing strong support and guidance. The Board places on record its appreciation to the NBE for its support and guidance. Finally, recalling that the Bank has come a long way and has still a long way to go, I want to assure you that in the years to come, our Bank will strongly pursue the laid down visionary strategy to bring about excellence and further penetrate the market to play the leading role in the banking industry. I also look forward to the continuation of a high level of Ethiopias economic growth within a stable macro-economic environment and to ABs successful operation during the FY 201920 and beyond. Thank you. country to ensure long-term and sustainable growth of the Bank. The major landmark in this regard includes, the Six Storey Jimma Mixed Use Building which was recently inaugurated and opened for branch use and other sideline businesses. At this point, the commencement of the construction of a 12 storey Bulbula Mixed Use Building is to be mentioned. In addition, in an effort to build its images at different strategic places, the Bank has acquired one building in each of Bale Robe and Shashemene Towns of the Oromia Regional State and in the City of Dire Dawa. The Banks move to construct its own buildings at strategic areas will continue in the future in a planned manner. The Human Resource Management is important for Banks, as banking is a service giving industry. Therefore, the Human Resource Policies and Practices of Awash Bank is focused on attracting, motivating and retaining qualified and skilled manpower. In line with this, steps were taken to improve manpower efficiency focusing on optimizing the existing resource through internal job postings, transfers and skill development initiatives. The nature of the business also requires continuous skill up with in-house or outside the country trainings. Accordingly, various trainings and capacity building activities were given to staff members of the Bank during the year ended June 30, 2019. Hence, from the total of 9,046 staff strength of the Bank, short- term trainings were given to 7,365 staff and 736 staff were sponsored by the Bank to pursue further education at different levels during the year under review. I would like to underline here that the Board is fully assertive to the extent that the Bank remains the most important pillar of the private banks, with all the capability to perform its main role, competence, qualifications and trustworthiness of the Management team and dedication and relentless efforts of the entire staff for the attainment of its grand vision on or before 2025. The Bank will continue to deliver its Prosper with the Leading Private Bank!

ANNUAL REPORT 201819 9 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS STATEMENT I feel proud and indeed pleased to announce to all respected Shareholders, Board of Directors, Members of Management and the hard working Awash staff, esteemed customers and all other stakeholders that Awash Banks performance was extra-ordinary in the financial year just ended and like the preceding years, it has stood vibrantly visible among private banks operating in the country. Let me seize this opportune moment to congratulate respected Shareholders, Board of Directors, Management and the entire staff, loyal customers and all other stakeholders of Awash Bank and Awash Insurance Company S.C. on the 25th Silver Jubilee of the formation of the two companies. The 25th anniversary celebration under the theme Celebrating Success, Envisioning the Future! is envisaged to glorify our past successes and serve as a spring board to renew our commitments for excellence in the years to come! The year just ended was indeed a year of big challenges. Instability in some parts of the country, huge demand-supply gap for hard currencies, the prevailing regulatory requirements like the 30 foreign currency surrender requirement, stiff competition among local banks for deposits, etc. were some of the challenges encountered by financial institutions, especially banks. In spite of the above challenges, however, with a concerted effort of all, our Bank was able to perform much better than the preceding years and has maintained its leading position in the private banking industry. As it has been correctly cited by a distinguished Management Scholar, one cannot make a serious of good decisions without first confronting the brutal facts of reality. The Scholar underlined that confronting the facts of reality, whatever they might be, and at the same time retaining a strong faith that one will prevail in the end regardless of the difficulties, has proved to be a source of strength to accomplish ones goals. This was what has exactly happened during the year and proved to be workable in our endeavor for excellence. Awash Banks profit before tax stood at Birr 3.34 billion from Birr 1.96 billion of last year the same Tsehay Shiferaw Chief Executive Officer Prosper with the Leading Private Bank! ANNUAL REPORT 201819 10 period i.e. Birr 1.38 billion or 70 growth. This private banking was extra-ordinary in the history of our Bank as well as in the private banking industry. The paid-up capital reached Birr 4.38 billion from Birr 2.94 billion of last year same period that is, an increment of Birr 1.44 billion and earnings per share EPS has shown an amazing growth from 543 in 2018 to 632 in 2019 for a par value of Birr 1,000, which is one of the highest figures in the private financial industry. As a result of rising cost of operation, upward revision of fringe benefits of employees and overall enhanced operation of the Bank, total expense has surged from Birr 3.44 billion in 201718 to Birr 4.71 billion in 201819. Of the total expense items, interest expense, personnel expense and depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment took the highest share. Total deposit as at end of June 30, 2019 stood at Birr 62.46 billion and that was the highest ever registered in the history of our Bank. The deposit balance grew by Birr 16.56 billion or 36 as compared to last year same period. At this point, I would like to underscore that the contribution of all staff members in resource mobilization activities is worthy of special mention. Total asset tremendously grew from Birr 55.27 billion in 201718 to Birr 74.77 billion in 201819, i.e. a growth of Birr 19.49 billion in a single year! This growth is mainly attributed to a significant growth of loans and advances by Birr 15.96 billion and purchase of NBE bills. The NPLs ratio stood at 1.1 as at end of June 2019 and that was far below the maximum threshold, i.e. 5, set by the National Bank of Ethiopia. The total number of branches of the Bank as at end of June 2019 was 410. The year ended June 30, 2019 was a very successful year to Awash Bank in respect of the following- 1. For the third time , our Bank has successfully attained all the targets set in the grand strategic document and this is a clear indication that our Banks journey from Good- to-Great by the end of 2025 is likely attainable, 2. The Customer Relationship Management CRM and Contact Center CC solutions, Performance Management System PMS and Cultural Transformation Initiatives are almost finalized and will be put in force in a very short period of time, 3. In view of its big role as an accelerator of momentum, upgrading of the Core Banking System is well underway and it is likely that the project will be successfully concluded shortly as per the schedule, 4. Jimma Building was fully completed and will be operational soon. Contract has been signed and site hand-over has already been made to a contractor for the construction of another building in Addis Ababa, Bulbula Building, etc The future of banking business in Ethiopia is surrounded by a mix of opportunities and challenges. The growth of the national economy, restoration of peace with neighboring countries, tremendous potential for banking business, relaxation of some regulatory requirements, commitment of the Federal and Regional Governments to support the sector, etc. are some of the envisaged opportunities. The situation of peace and stability as well as the expected stiff competition among the existing and new entrant banks will obviously challenge the existing trend of business as usual. Im, however, optimistic that things will change for the better if we work hard and face the brutal facts of reality as Martin Luther King Jr. once said, one can Carve a tunnel of hope through the dark mountain of disappointment. At this point, I would like to extend my special thanks to our valued customers for the confidence they have on us and being with us, and the strong Management and committed staff members for making a big difference! I believe, if we stand together like the previous years, Awash Bank will further stand visible in the next generation also! At last, I would like to thank all Shareholders, Board of Directors, Federal and Regional Government offices and particularly the National Bank of Ethiopia for their support and guidance in our endeavor to achieve our business objectives! May God bless our country and Awash Bank! Prosper with the Leading Private Bank!

All financial information presented in this report, including the comparative periods, were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS. Financial Year 201819 witnessed slowdown in global economic growth and world trade volumes largely associated with increased trade protectionism, geopolitical tensions and tighter financial conditions with ramifications on the demand for Ethiopias major exportable products, inflow of remittances and capital. On the domestic front, FY 201819 was marked by macroeconomic imbalances and structural weaknesses as witnessed by double digit inflation, stagnant export performances, and shortage of foreign exchange, elevated risk of debt distress, low productivity and difficulty in doing business. Since the launching of the 10 year transformation roadmap in 201617, under the theme Transforming AIB Vision 2025, Awash Bank has focused on executing its core strategy initiatives of aggressively growing market share and penetration, driving service delivery excellence, building high performance culture and instituting effective risk management system through technology enabled operations. This has enabled the Bank to withstand both global and domestic challenges and exhibit Report of the Board of Directors superior operational and financial performances among the private banks operating in Ethiopia by more than doubling its deposit balances , loan portfolio, asset size and profit levels in three years time. 1. OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCES Awash Bank has registered another set of impressive results in all operational areas during Financial Year 201819, demonstrating the fact that the Bank is on the right track to achieve its strategic aspiration of becoming One of the Top Ten Private Commercial Banks in East Africa by 2025. 1.1. Mobilization of Deposits Spurred by growing customer base, wide branch networks and offerings of convenient and customized products using different service delivery channels, Awash Bank has continued to depict strong deposit mobilization performances in 201819 among private banks operating in Ethiopia. Accordingly, the total deposit of the Bank, including interest free banking and margin held on letters of credit, rose to Birr 62.5 billion by the end of June 2019, up by Birr 16.6 billion 36 percent compared with the same period of last year. Of the total deposit of the Bank, saving deposits accounted for the lions share of total deposit 59 Percent, followed by demand deposits 30 percent, time deposits 6 percent and margins held on letters of credit 5 percent, largely mirroring the strategy of the Bank to focus on low cost and sustainable sources of funding. 201617 201718 201819 A B C B-A C-B BA CB Saving deposits 20,142 27,336 36,773 7,194 9,437 36 35 Demand deposits 8,242 12,993 18,929 4,751 5,936 58 46 Time deposits 2,316 3,122 3,914 806 792 35 25 LC Margin 2,193 2,455 2,848 262 393 12 16 Total deposit 32,893 45,906 62,464 13,013 16,558 40 36 Descriptions Financial Year Growth Absolute Table1 Deposit by Type In Millions of Birr Prosper with the Leading Private Bank!

International Banking Services Awash Bank continues to play a key role in supporting the international trade activities of Ethiopia by providing diversified trade finance instruments to both exporters and importers that will facilitate their international payments and reduce the associated risks. For instance, the Banks outstanding loans and advances to the export sector rose to over Birr 9 billion in 201819 from Birr 4 billion in 201617. This, of course, indicates the Banks effort to enhance the scarce foreign exchange earning capacity of the country through financing the export sector. Another effort made by the Bank to encourage the inflow of foreign currency to the country during the period under review was enabling foreigners transact their purchases conveniently using their VISA card, Master Card and China Union Pay Card. As a mechanism of boosting inward remittances through international money transfer agents and bank to bank transfers, namely Awash Bank Swift AWINETAA, the Bank continued to roll- out the incentive mechanism that award winners with the prize through the lottery system. In this regard, the Bank has colorfully awarded the 5th and 6th round lottery winners in 201819. In the review period, the Bank has also formed strategic alliance with different organizations such as international NGOs and FDIs. Overall, the attempt of the Bank to enhance its foreign exchange earnings through different mechanisms had culminated in a record high earnings of foreign currency by the Bank in 201819.

ANNUAL REPORT 201819 19 1.4 Total Assets During the period under review, the asset size of the Bank expanded markedly paving the way for future growth and expansion. The total asset of the Bank reached Birr 74.6 billion by the end of June 30, 2019, up by Birr 19.4 billion 35 percent against the same period of last year. The exhibited surge in the asset size of the Bank was mainly attributable to a significant growth in loans and advances to customers, which rose from Birr 31 billion a year ago to Birr 47 billion as at end of June 2019. The strong growth in the asset position of the Bank was mainly funded by deposits from customers, which accounted for about 80 percent of the total assets. Figure 3 Trends in Total Assets In Billions of Birr 1.5 Capital Financial Year 201819 witnessed substantial growth in paid-up capital of the Bank a growth of Birr 1.4 billion in a single year, mirroring the determination of the Shareholders of Awash Bank to abide by their decision of raising the paid-up capital of the Bank to Birr six billion by the end of June 2021. As a result, the total paid- up capital of the Bank rose to Birr 4.4 billion as at June 30, 2019 from Birr 2.9 billion a year ago. The total capital of the Bank also grew to Birr 9.6 billion in 201819 from Birr 6.5 billion in 201718. The overall capital level of Awash Bank, as measured by capital adequacy ratio is above the minimum requirement stipulated by the National Bank of Ethiopia. Nevertheless, in line with the strategic aspirations of the Bank to become one of the top ten banks in East Africa by 2025 and the growth initiatives of the Bank including building a new Head Quarter complex, the Bank needs to boost its capital level through a combination of fresh equity injections and the reinvestments of profits. 2.

"Awash Bank or the Bank" is a private commercial bank domiciled in Ethiopia. The Bank was established in November 1994, in accordance with the provisions of the Commercial Code of Ethiopia of 1960 and the Licensing and Supervision of Banking Business Proclamation No. 5922008. The Bank's registered office is at The Bank is principally engaged in the provision of diverse range of financial products and services to corporate, retail and SME clients base in Ethiopian market. Summary of significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. The financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2019 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards "IFRS" as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board "IASB". Additional information required by National regulations is included where appropriate. The financial statements comprise the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the statement of financial position, the statement of changes in equity, the statement of cash flows and the notes to the financial statements. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern principle under the historical cost concept, except for the following defined benefit pension plans plan assets measured at fair value. Equity investments which is measured at fair value. All values are rounded to the nearest thousand, except when otherwise indicated. The financial statements are presented in thousands of Ethiopian Birr ETB' 000. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Banks accounting policies. Changes in assumptions may have a significant impact on the financial statements in the period the assumptions changed. Management believes that the underlying assumptions are appropriate and that the Bank's financial statements, therefore, present the financial position and results fairly. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in Note 4. 12 Awash International Bank S.C.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2019 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 2.2.1 Going concern 2.2.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures New Standards, amendments, interpretations New Standards, amendments, interpretations effective and adopted during the year. IFRS 9 sets out requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets, financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non-financial items. This standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement. The requirements of IFRS 9 represent a significant change from IAS 39. The new standard brings fundamental changes to the accounting for financial assets and to certain aspects of the accounting for financial liabilities. As a result of the adoption of IFRS 9, the Bank has adopted consequential amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, which require separate presentation in the statement of profit or loss and OCI of interest revenue calculated using the effective interest method. Previously, the Bank disclosed this amount in the notes to the financial statements. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 2014 The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The management have no doubt that the Bank would remain in existence after 12 months. The Bank has initially adopted IFRS 9 from 1 July 2018, a number of other new standards are also effective from 1 July 2018. Due to the transition method chosen by the Bank in applying IFRS 9, comparative information throughout these financial statements has not generally been restated to reflect its requirements. The effect of initially applying these standards is mainly attributed to the following an increase in impairment losses recognised on financial assets Note 37 and additional disclosures related to IFRS 9 see Notes 2.6 and 37 Except for the changes below, the Bank has consistently applied the accounting policies as set out in Note 2 to all periods presented in these financial statements. Additionally, the Bank has adopted consequential amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures that are applied to disclosures about 2019, but have not been applied to the comparative information. The key changes to the Banks accounting policies resulting from its adoption of IFRS 9 are summarised below. The full impact of adopting the standard is set out in Note 37. 13 Awash International Bank S.C.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2019 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued Transition from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 The adoption of IFRS 15 did not impact the timing or amount of fee and commission income from contracts with customers and the related assets and liabilities recognised by the Bank. Changes in accounting policies resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 have been applied retrospectively, except comparative periods which have generally not been restated. Differences in the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained earnings and reserves as at 1 July 2018. Accordingly, the information presented for 2018 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and therefore is not comparable to the information presented for 2019 under IFRS 9. The Bank used the exemption not to restate comparative periods but considering that the amendments made by IFRS 9 to IAS 1 introduced the requirement to present interest income calculated using the effective interest rate as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss and OCI the Bank changed the description of the line item from interest income reported in 2018 to interest income calculated using the effective interest method. measured at FVTPL. that credit risk on the asset had not increased significantly since its initial recognition. IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers This standard replaces IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IAS 18 Revenue, IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes, IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate, IFRIC 18 Transfer of Assets from Customers and SIC-31 Revenue Barter of Transactions Involving Advertising Services.

IFRS 16 - Leases IFRIC 23 Clarification on accounting for Income tax exposures This standard was issued in January 2016 effective 1 January 2019 . It sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. The objective is to ensure that lessees and lessors provide relevant information in a manner that faithfully represents those transactions. The standard introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. A lessee is required to recognise a right-of-use of asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. it also substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. The Bank is yet to assess the expected impact of this standard. The entity will also need to provide disclosures, under existing disclosure requirements, about a judgments made b assumptions and other estimates used and c potential impact of uncertainties not reﬂected. The new Standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Bank is assessing the potential impact on its financial statements resulting from the application of IFRIC 23. The standard contains a single model that applies to contracts with customers and two approaches to recognise revenue at a point in time or over time. The standard specifies how and when the bank will recognise revenue as well as requiring such entities to provide users of financial statements with more informative, relevant disclosures. There was no material impact of application of IFRS 15 and no adjustment to retained earnings was required. IFRIC 23 clarifies the accounting for income tax treatments that have yet to be accepted by tax authorities, whilst also aiming to enhance transparency. IFRIC 23 explains how to recognise and measure deferred and current income tax assets and liabilities where there is uncertainty over a tax treatment. An uncertain tax treatment is any tax treatment applied by an entity where there is uncertainty over whether that treatment will be accepted by the tax authority. If an entity concludes that it is probable that the tax authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment that has been taken or is expected to be taken on a tax return, it should determine its accounting for income taxes consistently with that tax treatment. If an entity concludes that it is not probable that the treatment will be accepted, it should reﬂect the effect of the uncertainty in its income tax accounting in the period in which that determination is made. Uncertainty is reﬂected in the overall measurement of tax and separate provision is not allowed. The entity is required to measure the impact of the uncertainty using the method that best predicts the resolution of the uncertainty that is, the entity should use either the most likely amount method or the expected value method when measuring an uncertainty. 15 Awash International Bank S.C.

Consistent with the calculation of a gain or loss on a plan amendment, entities will now use updated actuarial assumptions to determine the current service cost and net interest for the period. Previously, entities would not have updated the calculation of these costs until the yearend. Further, if a defined benefit plan is settled, any asset ceiling would be disregarded when determining the plan assets as part of the calculation of gain or loss on settlement. The amendments apply for plan amendments, curtailments or settlements that occur on or after 1 January 2019, or the date on which the amendments are first applied. Earlier application is permitted. The Bank is assessing the impact on the financial statements The amendment includes the concept of obscuring to the definition, alongside the existing references to omitting and misstating. Additionally, the amendment also adds the increased threshold of could inﬂuence to could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence as below. The amendment refines the definition of Material to make it easier to understand and aligning the definition across IFRS Standards and the Conceptual Framework. Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity. However, the amendment has also removed the definition of material omissions or misstatements from IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. The amendments are effective from 1 January 2020 but may be applied earlier. The Bank is assessing the potential impact on its financial statements resulting from the application of the refined definition of materiality. 16 Awash International Bank S.C.

Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over those policies. The Banks investments in its associates are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Banks share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment. The statement of profit or loss reflects the Banks share of the results of operations of the associate. Any change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Banks OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the Bank recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Bank and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate. After application of the equity method, the Bank determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its associate. At each reporting date, the Bank determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Bank calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, then recognises the loss as Share of profit of an associate and a joint venture in the statement of profit or loss. Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Bank measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in statement of profit or loss. Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Bank operates 'the functional currency'. The functional currency and presentation currency of the Bank is the Ethiopian Birr ETB. 17 Awash International Bank S.C.

Effective interest rate and amortised cost Policy applicable from 1 July 2018 Interest income and expense are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to When calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments other than credit-impaired assets, the Bank estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not expected credit losses. For credit-impaired financial assets, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate is calculated using estimated future cash flows including expected credit losses. the gross carrying amount of the financial asset the amortised cost of the financial liability. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Bank and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty. The Bank earns income from interest on loans and advances given to customers, service charges and commissions from customers, interest income from Deposits with local and correspondent banks, investment in NBE National Bank of Ethiopia bills. Other income includes incomes like foreign currency transactions, dividend, rental, and other miscellaneous incomes. Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and from the translation at exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Bank's functional currency are recognised in profit or loss within other lossincome. Monetary items denominated in foreign currency are translated using the closing rate as at the reporting date. Changes in the fair value of monetary securities denominated in foreign currency classified as available for sale are analysed between translation differences resulting from changes in the amortised cost of the security and other changes in the carrying amount of the security. Translation differences related to changes in amortised cost are recognised in profit or loss, and other changes in carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at fair value, such as equities classified as FVOCI, are included in other comprehensive income. 18 Awash International Bank S.C.

Interest income and expense on all trading assets and liabilities are considered to be incidental to the Banks trading operations and are presented together with all other changes in the fair value of trading assets and liabilities in net trading income. The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, if the amount is material. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability. The amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance or impairment allowance before 1 July 2018. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance. In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset when the asset is not credit-impaired or to the amortised cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis. For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the asset. The calculation of interest income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves. Interest income and expense presented in the statement of profit or loss and OCI include Interest income and expense on other financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL are presented in net income from other financial instruments at FVTPL. 19 Awash International Bank S.C.

Other fees and commission expenses relate mainly to transaction and service fees and are expensed as the services are received. This is recognised when the Banks right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when the shareholders approve and declare the dividend. These are gains and losses arising on settlement and translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the functional currencys mid rate of exchange at the reporting date. This amount is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and it is further broken down into realised and unrealised portion. The monetary assets and liabilities include financial assets within the foreign currencies deposits received and held on behalf of third parties etc. For all financial instruments measured at amortised cost and interest bearing financial assets classified as available forsale interest income or expense is recorded using the effective interest rate EIR, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. The calculation takes into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument for example, prepayment options and includes any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and are an integral part of the EIR, but not future credit losses. The carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability is adjusted if the Bank revises its estimates of payments or receipts. The adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the original EIR and the change in carrying amount is recorded as 'Interest and similar income' for financial assets and 'Interest and similar expense' for financial liabilities. Once the recorded value of a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been reduced due to an impairment loss, interest income continues to be recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss. Fees and commission income and expenses that are integral to the effective interest rate on a financial asset or liability are included in the measurement of the effective interest rate. Other fees and commission income such as rental income, telephone and SWIFT are recognised as the related services are performed. 20 Awash International Bank S.C.

Recognition and initial measurement b. Classification and subsequent measurement i Financial assets The Bank shall initially recognise loans and advances, deposits, debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities on the date on which they are originated. All other financial instruments including regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets shall be recognised on the trade date, which is the date on which the Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset or financial liability shall be measured initially at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. On initial recognition, a financial asset shall be classified either as measured at either amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI or fair value through profit or loss FVTPL. The Bank shall measure a financial asset at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated at FVTPL the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest SPPI. A debt instrument shall be measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated at FVTPL the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI. On initial recognition, an equity investment that is held for trading shall be classified at FVTPL. However, for equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. All other financial assets that do not meet the classification criteria at amortised cost or FVOCI, above, shall be classified as measured at FVTPL. In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI or at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise . 21 Prosper with the Leading Private Bank! ANNUAL REPORT 201819 54 Awash International Bank S.C. Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2019 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued - Business model assessment - Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest The Bank shall make an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular, whether managements strategy focuses on earning contractual interest revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Banks management the risks that affect the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model and its strategy for how those risks are managed how managers of the business are compensated e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected and the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Banks stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised. Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis shall be measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. Financial assets shall not be reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Bank changes its business model for managing financial assets. For the purposes of this assessment, principal shall be defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. Interest shall be defined as the consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs, as well as profit margin. In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Bank considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Bank considers contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows leverage features prepayment and extension terms terms that limit the Banks claim to cash flows from specified assets e.g. non-recourse loans and features that modify consideration of the time value of money e.g. periodical reset of interest rates. 22 Awash International Bank S.C.

Impairment The Bank shall classify its financial liabilities, other than financial guarantees and loan commitments, as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial guarantee is an undertakingcommitment that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified party fails to meet its obligation when due in accordance with the contractual terms. Financial guarantees issued by the Bank are initially measured at their fair values and, if not designated as at FVTPL, are subsequently measured at the higher of the amount of the obligation under the guarantee, as determined in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with the revenue recognition policies. At each reporting date, the Bank shall assess whether there is objective evidence that financial assets except equity investments, other than those carried at FVTPL, are impaired. The Bank shall recognise loss allowances for expected credit losses ECL on the following financial instruments that are not measured at FVTPL financial assets that are debt instruments lease receivables financial guarantee contracts issued and loan commitments issued. No impairment loss shall be recognised on equity investments. The Bank shall measure loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except for the following, which are measured as 12-month ECL debt investment securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other financial instruments other than lease receivables on which credit risk has not increased significantly since their initial recognition. Loss allowances for lease receivables shall always be measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. 12-month ECL is the portion of ECL that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Financial instruments for which a 12-month ECL is recognised are referred to as Stage 1 financial instruments. Life-time ECL is the ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument. Financial instruments for which a lifetime ECL is recognised but which are not credit-impaired are referred to as Stage 2 financial instruments. 23 Prosper with the Leading Private Bank!

It shall be measured as follows for financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date stage 1 and 2 as the present value of all cash shortfalls i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the Bank in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive for financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date stage 3 as the difference between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows for undrawn loan commitments as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Bank if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive and for financial guarantee contracts as the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that the Bank expects to recover. If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset. If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset. At each reporting date, the Bank shall assess whether financial assets carried at amortised cost, debt financial assets carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit impaired referred to as Stage 3 financial assets. A financial asset shall be considered credit impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. 24 Awash International Bank S.C.

The combined amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision and for debt instruments measured at FVOCI no loss allowance is recognised in the statement of financial position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance shall be disclosed and is recognised in the fair value reserve. Loans and debt securities shall be written off either partially or in full when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the amount in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Bank determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment shall be carried out at the individual asset level. Recoveries of amounts previously written off shall be included in impairment losses on financial instruments in the statement of profit or loss and OCI. Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Banks procedures for recovery of amounts due. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer a breach of contract such as a default or past due event the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Bank on terms that the Bank would not consider otherwise it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation or the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties. A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrowers condition shall be considered to be credit-impair unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more shall be considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different. 25 Prosper with the Leading Private Bank!

Derecognition i Financial assets ii Financial liabilities The Bank shall assess whether a financial guarantee contract held is an integral element of a financial asset that is accounted for as a component of that instrument or is a contract that is accounted for separately. Where the Bank determines that the guarantee is an integral element of the financial asset, then any premium payable in connection with the initial recognition of the financial asset shall be treated as a transaction cost of acquiring it. The Bank shall consider the effect of the protection when measuring the fair value of the debt instrument and when measuring ECL. On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised and the sum of i the consideration received including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed and ii any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI shall be recognised in profit or loss. Any cumulative gainloss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI shall not be recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities. Any interest in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Bank shall be recognised as a separate asset or liability. The Bank shall derecognise a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Bank shall derecognise a financial asset when Where the Bank determines that the guarantee is not an integral element of the debt instrument, then it shall recognise an asset representing any prepayment of guarantee premium and a right to compensation for credit losses. The contractual right to the cash flows from the financial asset expires see also 1.4, or It transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. 26 Awash International Bank S.C.

Modifications of financial assets and financial liabilities i Financial assets ii Financial liabilities fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs shall be included in the initial measurement of the asset and other fees are included in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition. If the terms of a financial asset are modified, then the Bank shall evaluate whether the cash flows of the modified asset are substantially different. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset shall be deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset shall be derecognised see 1.3 and a new financial asset shall be recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modification shall be accounted for as follows If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the Bank plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it shall first consider whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. Where the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the Bank shall first recalculate the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognises the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. Any costs or fees incurred and fees received as part of the modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and shall be amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset. Where such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower, then the gain or loss shall be presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it shall be presented as interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method. The Bank shall derecognise a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms shall be recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. Consideration paid shall include non-financial assets transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability. 27 Prosper with the Leading Private Bank!

Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place regular way trades are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Bank commits to purchase or sell the asset. A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. At initial recognition, the Bank may designate certain financial assets as at FVTPL because this designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch, which would otherwise arise. The Bank shall designate certain financial liabilities as at FVTPL in either of the following circumstances the liabilities are managed, evaluated and reported internally on a fair value basis or the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. Where the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost of the liability shall be recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any costs and fees incurred are recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial liability by re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument. Financial assets and financial liabilities shall be offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Bank currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate EIR method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in interest and similar income in statement of profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in statement of profit or loss in loan impairment charge. The Banks loans and receivables comprise loans and advances to customers, NBE bills and Ethiopian government bonds . Available-for-sale AFS financial assets AFS investments include equity investments. Equity investments classified as AFS are those which are neither classified as heldfortrading nor designated at fair value through profit or loss. Debt securities in this category are those which are intended to be held for an indefinite period of time and which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or in response to changes in the market conditions. After initial measurement, AFS financial investments are subsequently measured at fair value with unrealised gains or losses recognised in OCI and credited in the AFS reserve until the investment is derecognised, at which time the cumulative gain or loss is recognised in other operating income, or the investment is determined to be impaired, when the cumulative loss is reclassified from the AFS reserve to statement of profit or loss in impairment loss on financial investment. Interest earned whilst holding AFS financial investments is reported as interest and similar income using the EIR method. Unquoted equity securities whose fair values cannot be reliably measured are carried at cost. All other available-for-sale investments are carried at fair value. When the transaction price differs from the fair value of other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets, the Bank immediately recognises the difference between the transaction price and fair value a Day 1 profit or loss in Other operating income. In cases where fair value is determined using data which is not observable, the difference between the transaction price and model value is only recognised in the profit or loss when the inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised. 29 Prosper with the Leading Private Bank! ANNUAL REPORT 201819 62 Awash International Bank S.C. Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2019 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued Reclassification of financial assets Reclassification is at the election of management, and is determined on an instrument by instrument basis. The Bank does not reclassify any financial instrument into the fair value through profit or loss category after initial recognition. For a financial asset reclassified out of the Availableforsale category, any previous gain or loss on that asset that has been recognised in equity is amortised to statement of profit or loss over the remaining life of the investment using the EIR. Any difference between the new amortised cost and the expected cash flows is also amortised over the remaining life of the asset using the EIR. If the asset is subsequently determined to be impaired then the amount recorded in equity is reclassified to statement of profit or loss. The Bank may reclassify a nonderivative trading asset out of the heldfortrading category and into the loans and receivables category if it meets the definition of loans and receivables and the Bank has the intention and ability to hold the financial asset for the foreseeable future or until maturity. If a financial asset is reclassified, and if the Bank subsequently increases its estimates of future cash receipts as a result of increased recoverability of those cash receipts, the effect of that increase is recognised as an adjustment to the EIR from the date of the change in estimate. Derecognition of financial assets A financial asset or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is primarily derecognised i.e. removed from the Banks statement of financial position when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or the Bank has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a passthrough arrangement and either a the Bank has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b the Bank has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. When the Bank has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Bank continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Banks continuing involvement. In that case, the Bank also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Bank has retained. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Bank could be required to repay. 30 Awash International Bank S.C.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2019 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued i Financial assets carried at amortised cost Impairment of financial assets The Bank assesses at each reporting date, whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. An impairment exists if one or more events that has occurred since the initial recognition of the asset an incurred loss event, has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. Evidence of impairment may include indications that the borrower or a group of borrowers is experiencing significant financial difficulty, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments and where observable data indicates that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. For financial assets carried at amortised cost such as loans and receivables, the Bank first assesses individually whether objective evidence of impairment exists for financial assets that are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If the Bank determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is, or continues to be, recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future expected credit losses that have not yet been incurred. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in statement of profit or loss. Interest income continues to be accrued on the reduced carrying amount and is accrued using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss. The interest income is recorded as part of Interest and similar income. Loans together with the associated allowance are written off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery and all collateral has been realised or has been transferred to the Bank. If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated impairment loss increases or decreases because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance account. If a future writeoff is later recovered, the recovery is credited to the 'loan impairment charge'. The present value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial assets original EIR. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current EIR. The calculation of the present value of the estimated future cash flows of a collateralised financial asset reflects the cash flows that may result from foreclosure less costs for obtaining and selling the collateral, whether or not foreclosure is probable. 31 Prosper with the Leading Private Bank! ANNUAL REPORT 201819 64 Awash International Bank S.C. Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2019 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued ii Available-for-sale AFS financial instruments Renegotiated loans Historical loss experience is adjusted on the basis of current observable data to reflect the effects of current conditions on which the historical loss experience is based and to remove the effects of conditions in the historical period that do not exist currently. Estimates of changes in future cash flows reflect, and are directionally consistent with, changes in related observable data from year to year such as changes in unemployment rates, property prices, commodity prices, payment status, or other factors that are indicative of incurred losses in the Bank and their magnitude. The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience. Available-for-sale financial assets are impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment, resulting from one or more loss events that occurred after initial recognition but before the reporting date, that have an impact on the future cash flows of the asset. In addition, an available-for-sale equity instrument is generally considered impaired if a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the instrument below its cost has occurred. Where an available-for-sale asset, which has been remeasured to fair value directly through equity, is impaired, the impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. If any loss on the financial asset was previously recognised directly in equity as a reduction in fair value, the cumulative net loss that had been recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss and is recognised as part of the impairment loss. The amount of the loss recognised in profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any previously recognised impairment loss. If, in a subsequent period, the amount relating to an impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be linked objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, where the instrument is a debt instrument, the impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss. An impairment loss in respect of an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale is not reversed through profit or loss but accounted for directly in equity. Where possible, the Bank seeks to restructure loans rather than to take possession of collateral. This may involve extending the payment arrangements and the agreement of new loan conditions. Once the terms have been renegotiated any impairment is measured using the original Effective Interest rate EIR as calculated before the modification of terms and the loan is no longer considered past due. Management continually reviews renegotiated loans to ensure that all criteria are met and that future payments are likely to occur. The loans continue to be subject to an individual or collective impairment assessment, calculated using the loans original EIR. For the purpose of a collective evaluation of impairment, financial assets are grouped on the basis of the Banks internal credit grading system, that considers credit risk characteristics such as asset type, industry, geographical location, collateral type, pastdue status and other relevant factors. Future cash flows on a group of financial assets that are collectively evaluated for impairment are estimated on the basis of historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics similar to those in the Bank. 32 Awash International Bank S.C.

The collateral comes in various forms such as cash via Bank guarantees and real estate. The estimated value of collateral is generally assessed at cost, at a minimum, at inception and based on the Bank's reporting schedule. An asset that had been possessed collateral represents financial and non-financial assets acquired by the Bank in settlement of overdue loans. The Banks policy is to determine whether a repossessed asset is best used for its internal operations or should be sold. Assets determined to be used for internal operations are initially recognised at the lower of their repossessed value or the carrying value of the original secured asset and included in the relevant assets depending on the nature and the Banks intention in respect of recovery of these assets, and are subsequently remeasured and accounted for in accordance with the accounting policies for these categories of assets. Assets that are determined better to be sold are included under other assets at their fair value at the repossession date in line with the Banks policy. Financial liabilities are classified at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and other financial liabilities. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of other financial liabilities, net of directly attributable transaction costs. The Bank's financial liabilities include customers deposits, margins held on letter of credits, other liabilities and borrowings. Interest expenditure is recognised in interest and similar expense. Financial instruments issued by the Bank, that are not designated at fair value through profit or loss but are classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost, where the substance of the contractual arrangement results in the Bank having an obligation either to deliver cash or another financial asset to the holder, or to satisfy the obligation other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of own equity shares. After initial measurement, financial liabilities at amortised cost are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate EIR. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on the issue and costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The Banks financial liabilities carried at amortised cost comprise customer deposits, margins held on letter of credit, long term deposits and borrowings. 33 Prosper with the Leading Private Bank!

Interest free export facility financing is stated in the statement of financial position of the bank at fair value of the consideration given amount of disbursement and subsequently, they shall be stated at disbursement amount less loss allowances if any. The Bank derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. Financial liabilities are derecognised when they have been redeemed or otherwise extinguished. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position where the Bank has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The Bank has also entered into arrangements that do not meet the criteria for offsetting but still allow for the related amounts to be set off in certain circumstances, such as bankruptcy or the termination of a contract. Cash comprises cash on hand, deposits held on call with other banks, and other short term highly liquid investments. Cash equivalents are deemed of immediate realization since they are easily convertible into cash within three months following the date of the financial statements. Murabaha is an Islamic financing transaction which represents an agreement whereby the Bank buys a commoditygood and sells it to a counterparty customer based on a promise received from that counterparty to buy the commodity according to specific terms and conditions. The selling price comprises of the cost of the commoditygoods and a pre-agreed profit margin. It is treated as financing receivables. Financing receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. The profit is quantifiable and contractually determined at the commencement of the contract. Murabaha Income profit is recognised as it accrues over the life of the contract using the effective profit method EPRM on the principal balance outstanding.

They are disclosed when reclassified during the year. An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value of the asset is included in statement of profit or loss. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Bank recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in statement of profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying value or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows 35 Prosper with the Leading Private Bank!

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2019 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 2.10 Intangible assets 2.11 Impairment of non-financial assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in statement of profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred . The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life, or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset, are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or methodology, as appropriate, which are then treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expenses on intangible assets with finite lives are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss, if significant. Amortisation is calculated using the straightline method to write down the cost of intangible assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives of six years. The Bank assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Bank estimates the assets recoverable amount. An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units CGU fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. The Bank bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Banks CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. 36 Awash International Bank S.C.

If such indication exists, the Bank estimates the assets or CGUs recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Other assets are generally defined as claims held against other entities for the future receipt of money. The other assets in the Bank's financial statements include the following Prepayments are payments made in advance for services to be enjoyed in future. The amount is initially capitalized in the reporting period in which the payment is made and subsequently amortised over the period in which the service is to be enjoyed. Other receivables are recognised upon the occurrence of an event or transaction as they arise and are cancelled when payment is received. The Bank measures financial instruments classified as available-for-sale at fair value at each statement of financial position date. Fair value related disclosures for financial instruments and non-financial assets that are measured at fair value or where fair values are disclosed are, summarised in the following notes Disclosures for valuation methods, significant estimates and assumptions Notes 3 and Note 4.7.1 Quantitative disclosures of fair value measurement hierarchy Note 4.7.2 Financial instruments including those carried at amortised cost Note 4.7.2 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either In the principal market for the asset or liability, or In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. 37 Awash International Bank S.C.

Wages, salaries, other allowances, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Bank. The Bank operates an accumulating leave policy this can be encashed when the employee is leaving employment. The Bank measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount that the entity expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end of each reporting period. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. The Bank uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole Level 1 Quoted unadjusted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable. Level 3 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Bank determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period. The Banks management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement, such as available-for-sale financial assets. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Bank has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. 38 Awash International Bank S.C.

Employer's contributions to this scheme are charged to profit or loss and other comprehensive income in the period to which they relate. The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognised in the statement of profit or loss in employee benefit expense, except where included in the cost of an asset, reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes curtailments and settlements. Past-service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Termination benefits are payable to executive directors when employment is terminated by the Bank before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Bank recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Profit-sharing and bonus plans The Bank recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to the companys shareholders after certain adjustments. The Bank recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation. 39 Awash International Bank S.C.

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Bank by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. A lease is an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee in return for a payment or series of payments the right to use an assets for an agreed period of time. The determination of whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. Leases that do not transfer to the Bank substantially all of the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased items are operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rental payable is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. A provision is recognised when the Bank has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Bank expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in statement of profit or loss net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as other operating expenses. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The legal reserve which is a statutory reserve to which no less than 25 of the net profits after taxation shall be transferred each year until such fund is equal to the capital. When the legal reserve equals the capital of the Bank, the amount to be transferred to the legal reserve account shall be 10 of the annual net profit. 40 Awash International Bank S.C.

Rental income is recorded as earned based on the contractual terms of the lease in Other operating income. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating operating leases are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned. The income tax expense or credit for the year is the tax payable on the current years taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in Ethiopia. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. Deferred tax is recognised as temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. 41 Awash International Bank S.C.

However, the financial statements continue to be prepared on going concern basis. Estimates and assumptions Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Banks financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets or liabilities affected in future periods. Other disclosures relating to the Banks exposure to risks and uncertainties include Capital management Note 4.6 Financial risk management and policies Note 4 Judgments In the process of applying the Banks accounting policies, management has made the following judgments, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements Operating lease commitments - Bank as lessee The Bank has entered into commercial property leases. The Bank has determined, based on an evaluation of the terms and conditions of the arrangements, such as the lease term not constituting a substantial portion of the economic life of the commercial property, that it does not retain all the significant risks and rewards of ownership of these properties and accounts for the contracts as operating leases. The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying values of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The Bank based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances beyond the control of the Bank. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur. 42 Awash International Bank S.C.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2019 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued a b Impairment losses on loans and receivables The Bank reviews its loan portfolios for impairment on an on-going basis. The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for loans and receivables that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for loans and receivables that are not individually significant. Impairment provisions are also recognised for losses not specifically identified but which, experience and observable data indicate are present in the portfolio at the date of assessment. For individually significant loans and receivables that have been deemed to be impaired, management deems that the cash flow from collateral would arise within one year where the loans and receivables is back by collateral. Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the portfolio when scheduling its future cash flows. The methodology and assumptions used for estimating both the amount and timing of future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience. The use of historical loss experience is supplemented with significant management judgment to assess whether current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual level of inherent losses is likely to differ from that suggested by historical experience. In normal circumstances, historical experience provides objective and relevant information from which to assess inherent loss within each portfolio. In other circumstances, historical loss experience provides less relevant information about the inherent loss in a given portfolio at the balance sheet date, for example, where there have been changes in economic conditions such that the most recent trends in risk factors are not fully reflected in the historical information. In these circumstances, such risk factors are taken into account when calculating the appropriate levels of impairment allowances, by adjusting the impairment loss derived solely from historical loss experience. The detailed methodologies, areas of estimation and judgment applied in the calculation of the Bank's impairment charge on financial assets are set out in the financial risk management section. The estimation of impairment losses is subject to uncertainty, which has increased in the current economic environment and is highly sensitive to factors such as the level of economic activity, unemployment rates, property price trends and interest rates. The assumptions underlying this judgement are highly subjective. The methodology and the assumptions used in calculating impairment losses are reviewed regularly in the light of differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience. See note 3.2 for more information. Fair value measurement of financial instruments When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the statement of financial position cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow DCF model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required in establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. As at year end, no financial instrument was measured at fair value. See Note 4.7.1 for further disclosures. 43 Awash International Bank S.C.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2019 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued c d e f Income Taxes The estimation of the useful lives and residual values of assets is based on managements judgement. Any material adjustment to the estimated useful lives of items of property and equipment will have an impact on the carrying value of these items. Impairment of non-financial assets Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The fair value less costs of disposal calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions, conducted at arms length, for similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a DCF model. The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Bank is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the assets performance of the CGU being tested. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. Defined benefit plans The cost of the defined benefit pension plan, long service awards, gratuity scheme and post-employment medical benefits and the present value of these defined benefit obligations are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long- term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. Depreciation and carrying value of property, plant and equipment 44 Awash International Bank S.C.

This process of risk management is critical to the Banks continuing profitability and each individual within the Bank is accountable for the risk exposures relating to his or her responsibilities. The Bank is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and different operational risks. It is also subject to various risks that affect the financial sector of the country. The independent risk control process does not include business risks such as changes in the environment, technology and industry. The Bank's policy is to monitor those business risks through the Banks strategic planning process. The Board Risk Sub-Committee, a subset of the Board of Directors is responsible for the overall risk management approach and for approving the risk management strategies and principles. It also has the responsibility to monitor the overall risk process within the Bank. The Senior Management chaired by the chief Executive Officer CEO has the overall responsibility for the development of the risk strategy and implementing principles, frameworks, policies and limits. It is also responsible for managing risk decisions and monitoring risk levels and reports on a monthly basis to the Board Risk Sub-Committee. The Risk Management Unit is responsible for implementing and maintaining risk related procedures to ensure an independent control process is maintained. The unit works closely with the Senior Management to ensure that procedures are compliant with the overall framework. The Risk Management Unit is responsible for monitoring compliance with risk principles, policies and limits across the Bank. It carries out an assessment of risk on an ad hoc basis to monitor the Bank's independent control of risks, including monitoring the risk of exposures against limits and the assessment of risks of new products and structured transactions. This unit also ensures the complete capture of the risks in risk measurement and reporting systems. Exceptions are reported, where necessary, to the Senior Management, and further to the Board Risk Sub-Committee and the relevant actions are taken to address exceptions and any areas of weakness. The Bank Finance and Treasury function is responsible for managing the Banks financial assets, financial liabilities and the overall financial structure. It is also primarily responsible for the funding and liquidity risks of the Bank. The Banks policy is that risk management processes throughout the Bank are audited annually by the Internal Audit Function, which examines both the adequacy of the procedures and the Banks compliance with the procedures. The Internal Audit Function discusses the results of all assessments with management, and reports its findings and recommendations to the Board Audit Sub-Committee. 45 Awash International Bank S.C.

The models make use of probabilities derived from historical experience, adjusted to reflect the economic environment. The Bank also runs worst-case scenarios that would arise in the event that extreme events, which are unlikely to occur, do in fact, occur. Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily performed based on limits established by the Bank. These limits reflect the business strategy and market environment of the Bank as well as the level of risk that the Bank is willing to accept, with additional emphasis on selected regions. In addition, the Banks policy is to measure and monitor the overall risk bearing capacity in relation to the aggregate risk exposure across all risk types and activities. Risk controls and mitigates, identified and approved for the Bank, are documented for existing and new processes and systems. The adequacy of these mitigates is tested on a periodic basis through administration of control self-assessment questionnaires, using an operational risk management tool which requires risk owners to confirm the effectiveness of established controls. These are subsequently audited as part of the review process. The Bank's financial assets are classified into the following measurement categories Financial assets at fair value through OCI 2018-AFS and Financial assets at amortized cost 2018-Loans and Receivables and the financial liabilities are classified into other liabilities at amortised cost. Financial instruments are classified in the statement of financial position in accordance with their legal form and substance. - Financial assets at fair value through OCI 2018-AFS - Financial assets at amortized cost 2018-Loans and Receivables 46 Awash International Bank S.C.

Exposure to credit risk is managed through periodic analysis of the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to determine their capacity to meet principal and interest thereon, and restructuring such limits as appropriate. Exposure to credit risk is also mitigated, in part, by obtaining collateral, commercial and personal guarantees . The Bank structures the levels of credit risk it undertakes by placing limits on the amount of risk accepted in relation to one borrower, or groups of borrowers, and to term of the financial instrument and economic sectors. - Financial assets at amortized cost 2018-Loans and Receivables The National Bank of Ethiopia NBE sets credit risk limit for a single borrower, one related party and all related parties to not exceed 25, 5 and 35 of Banks total capital amount as of the reporting quarterly period respectively. Credit management is conducted as per the risk management policy and guideline approved by the board of directors and the Risk Management Committees. Such policies are reviewed and modified periodically based on changes and expectations of the markets where the Bank operates, regulations, and other factors. - Financial assets at fair value through OCI 2018-AFS 47 Awash International Bank S.C.

The Bank's policy is to pursue timely realisation of the collateral in a timely manner. The Bank does not generally use the non-cash collateral for its own operations. In measuring credit risk of Financial assets at amortized cost to various counterparties, the Bank considers the character and capacity of the obligor to pay or meet contractual obligations, current exposures to the counterpartyobligor and its likely future developments, credit history of the counterpartyobligor and the likely recovery ratio in case of default obligations-value of collateral and other solutions. Our credit exposure comprises wholesale and retail Financial assets at amortized cost which are developed to reflect the needs of our customers. The Banks policy is to lend principally on the basis of our customers repayment capacity through quantitative and qualitative evaluation. However we ensure that our loans are backed by collateral to reflect the risk of the obligors and the nature of the facility. The Bank holds collateral against loans and advances to customers in the form of bank guarantees and property. Estimates of fair value are based on the value of collateral assessed at the time of lending. The Bank's maximum exposure to credit risk at 30 June 2019 and 30 June 2018 is represented by the net carrying amounts in the statement of financial position. 48 Awash International Bank S.C.

The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This capacity may, nevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is the case for higher ratings. This indicates that expectations of default risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered adequate, but adverse business or economic conditions are more likely to impair this capacity. This indicates financial institutions or other counterparties with no available ratings and cash in hand.

However, collateral provides additional security and the Bank generally requests that corporate borrowers provide it. The Bank may take collateral in the form of a first charge over real estate, floating charges over all corporate assets and other liens and guarantees. Because of the Banks focus on customers creditworthiness, the Bank does not routinely update the valuation of collateral held against all loans to customers. Valuation of collateral of real estates buildings is updated and reviewd every three year and at the same time whenever the loan foreclosure measure is opted. For credit- impaired loans, the Bank obtains appraisals of collateral because it provides input into determining the management credit risk actions. AS at 30 June 2019, the net carrying amount of credit impaired loans and advances to customers amounted to ETB 505.024 million 2018 ETB 464.500 million and the value of identifiable collateral held against those loans and advances amounted to ETB 957.627 million 2018 ETB 1,059.867 million. For each loan, the value of disclosed collateral is capped at the nominal amount of the loan that it is held against. As at 30 June 2019, the Bank had no exposure to credit risk of the investment securities designated as at FVTPL. 53 Awash International Bank S.C.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2019 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 4.3.6 ii Significant increase in credit risk When determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Bank considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Banks historical experience and expert credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The objective of the assessment is to identify whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred for an exposure by comparing iii Credit risk grades The Bank allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on a variety of data that is determined to be predictive of the risk of default and applying experienced credit judgement. Credit risk grades are defined using qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of risk of default. These factors vary depending on the nature of the exposure and the type of borrower. Credit risk grades are defined and calibrated such that the risk of default occurring increases exponentially as the credit risk deteriorates so, for example, the difference in risk of default between credit risk grades 1 and 2 is smaller than the difference between credit risk grades 2 and 3. Each exposure is allocated to a credit risk grade on initial recognition based on available information about the borrower. Exposures are subject to ongoing monitoring, which may result in an exposure being moved to a different credit risk grade. The monitoring typically involves use of the following data a. Term loan exposures Information obtained during periodic review of customer files e.g. audited financial statements, management accounts, budgets and projections. Examples of areas of particular focus are gross profit margins, financial leverage ratios, debt service coverage, compliance Data from credit reference agencies, press articles, changes in external credit ratings Actual and expected significant changes in the political, regulatory and technological environment of the borrower or in its business activities Internally collected data on customer behaviour e.g. utilisation of credit card facilities Affordability metrics the remaining lifetime probability of default PD as at the reporting date with the remaining lifetime PD for this point in time that was estimated at the time of initial recognition of the exposure adjusted where relevant for changes in prepayment expectations. the Bank uses three criteria for determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk quantitative test based on movement in PD qualitative indicators and a backstop of 30 days past due, Amounts arising from ECL i Inputs, assumptions and techniques used for estimating impairment See accounting policy in Note 2.6.1. c 54 Awash International Bank S.C.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2019 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued b. Overdraft exposures iv Generating the term structure of PD Credit risk grades are a primary input into the determination of the term structure of PD for exposures. The Bank collects performance and default information about its credit risk exposures analysed by type of product and borrower as well as by credit risk grading. The Bank employs statistical models to analyse the data collected and generate estimates of the remaining lifetime PD of exposures and how these are expected to change as a result of the passage of time. The Bank assesses whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition at each reporting date. Determining whether an increase in credit risk is significant depends on the characteristics of the financial instrument and the borrower. The credit risk may also be deemed to have increased significantly since initial recognition based on qualitative factors linked to the Banks credit risk management processes that may not otherwise be fully reflected in its quantitative analysis on a timely basis. This will be the case for exposures that meet certain heightened risk criteria, such as placement on a watch list. Such qualitative factors are based on its expert judgment and relevant historical experiences. As a backstop, the Bank considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when an asset is more than 30 days past due. Days past due are determined by counting the number of days since the earliest elapsed due date in respect of which full payment has not been received. Due dates are determined without considering any grace period that might be available to the borrower. If there is evidence that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk relative to initial recognition, then the loss allowance on an instrument returns to being measured as 12-month ECL. Some qualitative indicators of an increase in credit risk, such as delinquency or forbearance, may be indicative of an increased risk of default that persists after the indicator itself has ceased to exist. In these cases, the Bank determines a probation period during which the financial asset is required to demonstrate good behaviour to provide evidence that its credit risk has declined sufficiently. When contractual terms of a loan have been modified, evidence that the criteria for recognising lifetime ECL are no longer met includes a history of up-to-date payment performance against the modified contractual terms. Payment record this includes overdue status as well as a range of variables about payment ratios Utilisation of the granted limit Requests for and granting of forbearance Existing and forecast changes in business, financial and economic conditions The Bank monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify significant increases in credit risk by regular reviews to confirm that the average time between the identification of a significant increase in credit risk and default appears reasonable there is no unwarranted volatility in loss allowance from transfers between 12-month PD Stage 1 and lifetime PD Stage 2. v Determining whether credit risk has increased 55 Awash International Bank S.C.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2019 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank in full, without recourse by the Bank to actions such as realising security if any is held Overdrafts are considered as being past due once the customer has breached an advised limit or been advised of a limit smaller than the current amount outstanding or it is becoming probable that the borrower will restructure the asset as a result of bankruptcy due to the borrowers inability to pay its credit obligations. In assessing whether a borrower is in default, the Bank considers indicators that are Inputs into the assessment of whether a financial instrument is in default and their significance may vary over time to reflect changes in circumstances. vii Incorporation of forward-looking The Bank incorporates forward-looking information into both the assessment of whether the credit risk of an instrument has increased significantly since its initial recognition and the measurement of ECL. For each segment, the Bank formulates three economic scenarios a base case, which is the median scenario, and two less likely scenarios, one upside and one downside. For each sector, the base case is aligned with the macroeconomic models information value output, a measure of the predictive power of the model, as well as base macroeconomic projections for identified macroeconomic variables for each sector. The upside and downside scenarios are based on a combination of a percentage error factor of each sector model as well as simulated optimistic and pessimistic macroeconomic projections based on a measure of historical macroeconomic volatilities. External information considered includes economic data and forecasts published by Business Monitor International, an external and independent macroeconomic data body. This is in addition to industry level, semi annual NPL trends across statistically comparable sectors. Periodically, the Bank carries out stress testing of more extreme shocks to calibrate its determination of the upside and downside representative scenarios. A comprehensive review is performed at least annually on the design of the scenarios by a panel of experts that advises the Banks senior management. The definition of default largely aligns with that applied by the Bank for regulatory capital purposes . The Bank considers a financial asset to be in default when vi Definition of default The Bank has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for each portfolio of financial instruments and, using an analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between macro-economic variables and credit risk and credit losses. 56 Awash International Bank S.C.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2019 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued The contractual terms of a loan may be modified for a number of reasons, including changing market conditions, customer retention and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of the customer. An existing loan whose terms have been modified may be derecognised and the renegotiated loan recognised as a new loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy set out. The Bank renegotiates loans to customers in financial difficulties referred to as forbearance activities to maximise collection opportunities and minimise the risk of default. Under the Banks forbearance policy, loan forbearance is granted on a selective basis if the debtor is currently in default on its debt or if there is a high risk of default, there is evidence that the debtor made all reasonable efforts to pay under the original contractual terms and the debtor is expected to be able to meet the revised terms. The revised terms usually include extending the maturity, changing the timing of interest payments and amending the terms of loan covenants. Both retail and corporate loans are subject to the forbearance policy. The Bank Credit Committee regularly reviews reports on forbearance activities. For financial assets modified as part of the Banks forbearance policy, the estimate of PD reflects whether the modification has improved or restored the Banks ability to collect interest and principal and the Banks previous experience of similar forbearance action. As part of this process, the Bank evaluates the borrowers payment performance against the modified contractual terms and considers various behavioural indicators. When modification results in derecognition, a new loan is recognised and allocated to Stage 1 assuming it is not credit-impaired at that time. Generally, forbearance is a qualitative indicator of a significant increase in credit risk and an expectation of forbearance may constitute evidence that an exposure is credit-impaired. A customer needs to demonstrate consistently good payment behaviour over a period of time before the exposure is no longer considered to be credit-impairedin default or the PD is considered to have decreased such that the loss allowance reverts to being measured at an amount equal to Stage 1. viii Modified financial assets When the terms of a financial asset are modified and the modification does not result in derecognition, the determination of whether the assets credit risk has increased significantly reflects comparison of its remaining lifetime PD at the reporting date based on the modified terms with the remaining lifetime PD estimated based on data on initial recognition and the original contractual terms. Predicted relationships between the key indicators and default rates on various portfolios of financial assets have been developed based on analysing semi annual historical data over the past 5 years. 58 Awash International Bank S.C. Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2019 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued Prosper with the Leading Private Bank! ANNUAL REPORT 201819 91 Awash International Bank S.C. Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2019 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued As described above, and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for Stage 1 financial assets, the Bank measures ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period including any borrowers extension options over which it is exposed to credit risk, even if, for credit risk management purposes, the Bank considers a longer period. The maximum contractual period extends to the date at which the Bank has the right to require repayment of an advance or terminate a loan commitment or guarantee. However, for overdrafts that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment component, the Bank measures ECL over a period longer than the maximum contractual period if the Banks contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the Banks exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period. These facilities do not have a fixed term or repayment structure and are managed on a collective basis. The Bank can cancel them with immediate effect but this contractual right is not enforced in the normal day-to-day management, but only when the Bank becomes aware of an increase in credit risk at the facility level. This longer period is estimated taking into account the credit risk management actions that the Bank expects to take, and that serve to mitigate ECL. These include a reduction in limits, cancellation of the facility andor turning the outstanding balance into a loan with fixed repayment terms. ix Measurement of ECL ECL for exposures in Stage 1 is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD by LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated by multiplying the lifetime PD by LGD and EAD. EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Bank derives the EAD from the current exposure to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract and arising from amortisation. The EAD of a financial asset is its gross carrying amount at the time of default. For lending commitments, the EADs are potential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated based on historical observations and forward-looking forecasts. For financial guarantees, the EAD represents the amount of the guaranteed exposure when the financial guarantee becomes payable. For some financial assets, EAD is determined by modelling the range of possible exposure outcomes at various points in time using scenario and statistical techniques. LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Bank estimates LGD parameters based on the history of recovery rates of claims against defaulted counterparties. The LGD models consider the structure, collateral, seniority of the claim, counterparty industry and recovery costs of any collateral that is integral to the financial asset. The key inputs into the measurement of ECL are the term structure of the following variables Probability of default PD loss given default LGD and exposure at default EAD The methodology of estimating PDs is discussed above under the heading Generating the term structure of PD. 59 Awash International Bank S.C.

Liquidity risk arises because of the possibility that the Bank might be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due as a result of mismatches in the timing of the cash flows under both normal and stress circumstances. Such scenarios could occur when funding needed for illiquid asset positions is not available to the Bank on acceptable terms. Liquidity risk management in the Bank is solely determined by the Asset and Liability Committee ALCO, which bears the overall responsibility for liquidity risk. The main objective of the Bank's liquidity risk framework is to maintain sufficient liquidity in order to ensure that we meet our maturing obligations. The maximum exposure to credit risk relating to a financial guarantee is the maximum amount the Bank could have to pay if the guarantee is called upon. The maximum exposure to credit risk relating to a loan commitment is the full amount of the commitment. The table below shows the Banks maximum credit risk exposure for commitments and guarantees. Loans with renegotiated terms Loans with renegotiated terms are defined as loans that have been restructured due to a deterioration in the borrowers financial position, for which the Bank has made concessions by agreeing to terms and conditions that are more favourable for the borrower than the Bank had provided initially and that it would not otherwise consider. A loan continues to be presented as part of loans with renegotiated terms until maturity, early repayment or write-off. Loans that were past due but not impaired Loans that were past due but not impaired are those for which contractual interest or principal payments were past due but the Bank believed that impairment was not appropriate on the basis of the level of security or collateral available andor the stage of collection of amounts owed to the Bank. The amounts disclosed exclude assets measured at FVTPL. 63 Awash International Bank S.C.

The cash flows presented are the undiscounted amounts to be settled in future. Assets held for managing liquidity risk Total financial liabilities Cash flow forecasting is performed by the Finance and Treasury function. The Finance and Treasury function monitors rolling forecasts of liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs. The Bank has incurred indebtedness in the form of borrowings. The Bank evaluates its ability to meet its obligations on an ongoing basis. Based on these evaluations, the Bank devises strategies to manage its liquidity risk. Prudent liquidity risk management implies that sufficient cash is maintained and that sufficient funding is available to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk of damage to the Banks reputation. 64 Awash International Bank S.C.

Market risk is defined as the risk of loss that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market risk factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads and their volatilities. Market risk can arise in conjunction with trading and non-trading activities of a financial institutions. The Bank does not ordinarily engage in trading activities as there are no active markets in Ethiopia. The main objective of Market Risk Management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will be affected by changes in market interest rates. Borrowings and lending obtained at variable rates give rise to interest rate risk. The Banks exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Banks obligations and financial assets with floating interest rates. The Bank is also exposed on fixed rate financial assets and financial liabilities. The Banks investment portfolio is comprised of treasury bills, Ethiopian government bonds and cash deposits. The table below sets out information on the exposures to fixed and variable interest instruments. Assets held for managing liquidity risk 65 Awash International Bank S.C.

The Bank is exposed to exchange rate risks to the extent of balances and transactions denominated in a currency other than the Ethiopian Birr ETB. The Banks foreign currency bank accounts act as a natural hedge for these transactions. Management has set up a policy to manage the Bank's foreign exchange risk against its functional currency. The table below summarises the impact of increasesdecreases of 10 on equity and profit or loss arising from the Bank's foreign denominated borrowings and cash and bank balances. The total foreign currency denominated assets exposed to risk as at year end 30 June 2019 was ETB 3.382billion 30 June 2018 ETB 3.047 billion. 66 Awash International Bank S.C.

Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources unobservable inputs reflect the Bank's market assumptions. - Financial assets at amortized cost 2018-Loans and Receivables Loans and advances to customers The following table summarises the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts are based on the values recognised in the statement of financial position. Level 1 Inputs that are quoted market prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i.e. as prices or indirectly i.e. derived from prices .This category includes instruments valued using quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active, another valuation technique in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data. In conclusion, this category is for valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable. Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs. This category includes all assets and liabilities for which the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the asset's or liability's valuation. This category includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments for which significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments. - Financial assets at fair value through OCI 2018-AFS 69 Awash International Bank S.C.

The cumulative balance in the regulatory risk reserve is thereafter reversed to the general reserve account. b The non-distributable reserve should be classified under Tier 1 as part of the core capital. Provisions under prudential guidelines are determined using the time based provisioning prescribed by the National Bank of Ethiopia NBE Directives. This is at variance with the incurred loss model required by IFRS under IAS 39. As a result of the differences in the methodologyprovision, there will be variances in the impairments allowances required under the two methodologies. The proclamation Financial Reporting Proclamation No.8472014 stipulates that Banks would be required to make provisions for loans as prescribed in the relevant IFRS Standards when IFRS is adopted. However, Banks would be required to comply with the following a Provisions for loans recognised in the income statement should be determined based on the requirements of IFRS. However, the IFRS provision should be compared with provisions determined under the NBE Directives and the expected impactchanges in other reserves should be treated as follows Prudential provisions is greater than IFRS provisions the excess provision resulting should be transferred from the general reserve retained earnings account to a regulatory risk reserve. The NBE Directive No. SBB495 requires the Bank to transfer annually 25 of its annual net profit to its legal reserve account until such account equals its capital. When the legal reserve account equals the capital of the Bank, the amount to be transferred to the legal reserve account will be 10 ten percent of the annual net profit. 91 Awash International Bank S.C.
