At the global level, tight monetary policies, restrictive financial conditions, and weak global trade growth led to slow economic growth, whose rate the IMF reported to be 3.5 in 2022 and 3.0 in 2023. Likewise, global foreign direct investment flows decreased by 12 in 2022 to USD 1.3 trillion, and they were expected to decline further in 2023. These phenomena negatively impacted the Ethiopian economy, particularly by leading to a slow growth of exports, imports, private transfers, and foreign direct investment. While the Ethiopian economy recovered in the 202223 FY growing by 7.2, amounts of export earnings, goods imports and private transfers dropped by 13.1, 5.3, and 11.3, respectively, from those in the preceding year. Be that as it may, CBE earned the ever highest gross profit in its history Birr 22 billion - from a gross income of Birr 119 billion. The Bank also recorded an impressive historical milestone as its deposit level surpassed Birr 1.05 trillion in the 202223 FY, owing to additional deposits amounting to Birr 163.1 billion. Proudly, CBE reached this level within just three years after it hit the Birr 504 billion record in 2019. The Bank's ever-expanding customer base was an important driving force behind the remarkable success of the Bank, as proved by the increase in new accounts opened and branches launched during the reporting period. Annual Report 202223 1 Annual Report 202223 1 The total number of CBE account holders increased by 12.2 to reach 40.3 million because 4.4 million new deposit accounts were opened. Particularly, the CBE NOOR service raised the number of IFB account holders to 6 million, recruiting nearly one million new ones. CBE registered a 32 increase in foreign currency earnings performance over the previous fiscal year as it gained USD 3.5 billion foreign currency and exceeded the respective target by 107. Moreover, the Bank disbursed Birr 151.2 billion in new loans, out of which Birr 77.3 billion, Birr 40 billion, and above Birr 17.6 billion were earmarked for private borrowers, fertilizer imports and CBE NOOR financing, respectively. This reflects the Bank's endeavor to address a wide range of customers. Agricultural loans rose by nearly 5 times and CBE NOOR financing by 130. Remarkably, the number of active digital channel users significantly increased to 10.7 million debit card holders, 8.6 million mobile banking service users and 10.2 million CBE Birr mobile money service users. Consequently, digital financial transactions outnumbered teller-mediated ones as over 771 million 65 of the transactions were carried out digitally, unlike only 35.4 of the transactions in the previous fiscal year. This indicates that CBE has progressively gone digital due to its efforts to adopt technology and provide convenient banking solutions to customers. At the same time, the branch network of the Bank expanded to 1,937 since 113 additional branches were opened to boost the access- ibility of the Bank. The number of branches dedicated to CBE NOOR services grew to 152 and that of multipurpose branches offering window-based CBE NOOR services to 1,785. CBE had 43,622 agents and 56,831 partner merchants as their numbers increased by 107.8 and 50.1, respectively. Hiring 12,141 permanent personnel, CBE increased the total number of its employees to 80,848 50,056 permanent and 30,792 contract workers, so it continued to be the largest employer in the country. It also enhanced the capacity of its staff throughout the FY, offering a variety of technical, developmental and ethics training programs to about 79,553 employees. One of the major events in the year was the launch of EthioDirect mobile application, which aimed to serve the Ethiopian diaspora by facilitating money transfers to Ethiopia. Against the backdrop of Ethiopia's foreign exchange constraints, CBE's efforts to increase digital financial services have been remarkable. In addition, the Banks digital application dubbed Fuel App assisted cashless fuel payment procedures for customers, marking a notable achievement in the year. A year goes by, a year comes CBE continues to move forward and thrive. Regardless of how well we have performed so far, we look forward to what is ahead with the conviction that there is always room for improvement. As the saying goes, success is a journey, not a destination! I guarantee all stake holders that CBE will maintain its growing pace by increasing investment in technology, internal capacity, and human resources, which will define the Banks future growth and help it to face future challenges. In connection with the remarkable achieve- ments registered in the 202223 FY, I sincerely appreciate the leadership of CBEs Board of Directors as well as the unfettered commit- ment and hard work of the Management and employees. Thanks are also due to our partners and other stakeholders for their respective contributions. Above all, I thank our customers for their unwavering trust, which has been the foundation of our success. Abie Sano President Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 2 CBE Shariá Advisory Committee SAC Statement for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30 2023 Pursuant to the CBEs SAC charter and its provision associated to IFB service, and in accordance with the IFRS AAOIFI Shariá standard, the SAC presents the following report CBE Interest Free Banking CBE Noor offers a wide range of deposit, financing and various banking and services comparable to other banking services in Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, irrespective of race, religion or company. We are very glad when we are honored to announce that the interest free banking CBE Noor has mobilized deposit of birr 90.5 billion and earned profit before tax of birr 1.71 Billion from IFB business during the budget year ended June 30 2023. Thus, we hope and anticipate that CBE Noor will continue to contribute more by upholding similar Shariah compliance dedication, implementations and applications without undermining the never-ending quest of customers and by addressing banking the unbanked, serving the missing middle and accommodating all those who are far from banks due to their uncompromised belief. As Shariah Advisory Committee of the Bank, we have given our highest dedication to ensure best quality and demonstrated commitment to Shariah compliance in the products, process, documentations, marketing and other related Sharia compliant products and services by the Bank during the fiscal year. Besides its advisory and Shariá compliance assurance services on the regular banking businesses, the Shariah Committee also supports on the development of other Shariah based products and services initiated and attend awareness creation programs to address questions may be raised by the Community at large. We have reviewed the principles and the contracts relating to the transactions and applications introduced by CBE Noor during the year ended 30 June 2023. We have also conducted our reviews to form an opinion as to whether the Bank has complied with Shariá Rules and Principles and also with the specific Fatwas, rulings and guidelines issued by us and the Bank. Annual Report 202223 3 The Banks management is responsible for ensuring that the bank conducts its business in accordance with Shariá Rules and Principles. It is our responsibility to form an independent opinion, based on our review of the operations of the Bank, and to report. We planned and performed our review so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Bank has not violated Shariá Rules and Principles. In our opinion a. The contracts transactions and dealings entered into by the Bank during the year ended 30 June 2023 that we have reviewed are in compliance with the Sharia Rules and Principles b. The profits distribution and loss allocation to the investment accounts complies with the principle adopted according to the Sharia rules and principles. c. All amounts devolved to the Bank from sources or realized from sources like penalties or by means that do not comply with the Sharia rules and principles were not incorporated in the Banks revenues and are placed and reported separately for charity purposes. d. The Responsibility of paying Zakat falls on Investment account holders. The Bank is not authorized to pay Zakat directly, as there is no law to that effect. Finally, the Sharia Advisory Committee takes this opportunity to express its thanks to the Board of Directors and the Banks management for their co-operation and their keenness in understanding and adherence to the rules of the noble Shariá principles. Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 4 1 HIGHLIGHTS OF GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC ECONOMIES 1.1 The Global Economy 1.2 The Ethiopian Economy Global economic activity continued to soften due to tight monetary policies, restrictive financial conditions, and weak global trade growth. Besides, the globally sought recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia - Ukraine war remained slow. Thus, global economy showed a sluggish growth at a rate of 3.5 in 2022 and 3.0 in 2023 IMF, 20231. In 2023, global trade growth weakened significantly to an estimated 0.6 with a sharp decline from the 5.7 figure in 2022, remaining below the pre- pandemic trend of 3.2. This slowdown is attributed to a slump in merchandise trade. By contrast, trade in services, particularly tourism and transport, continued to recover. International tourism showed signs of a robust recovery and is expected to reach pre-pandemic levels by 2024 UNCTAD 20242. Global foreign direct investment FDI flows in 2022 fell by 12 to USD 1.3 trillion and are expected to be negatively impacted in 2023. The global unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 the lowest level since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2023,though it showed a modest improvement in 2022 ILO, January 20243. On the other hand, remittances to low- and middle-income countries are estimated to grow by 3.8 in 2023 with a moderation from the high growth rate of 7 in 2022 World Bank, December 20234. During the 202223 FY, the average price of energy and non-energy items declined by 0.7 and 7.8, respectively. Similarly, the average price of Arabica coffee decreased by 8.3 to USD 5.1kg and that of gold declined marginally by 0.2 to USD 1,830.4 troy oz. The price of oilseeds showed a continuous decline throughout the year. Likewise, the prices of several imported commodities declined from those in the previous year. Crude oil prices dropped by 5.4 to USD 84.3 per barrel, while palm oil prices decreased significantly by 32.4 to USD 948.9 per metric ton. The average prices of most metals and minerals except nickel also went down. Notably, the average prices of DAP and urea fertilizers decreased by 13.6 and 34, reaching USD 646 per metric ton and USD 471.6 per metric ton, respectively.5 Ethiopia is slowly emerging from multiple and overlapping shocks that have been occurring in the past three years. The country's economy grew by 7.2 during the 202223 FY. Sector-wise, outputs of the agriculture, industry, and service sectors rose by 6.3, 6.9, and 8, respectively MoPD, 20236. During the 202223 FY, export earnings totalled to USD 3.6 billion with a 13.1 decrease from the previous fiscal year. Likewise, goods imports showed a 5.3 decline. Ethiopia earned USD 2.8 billion during the FY from private transfers, which showed an 11.3 decrease from the earnings in the preceding year. Even if the overall balance of payments registered a deficit, it is slightly narrower as compared with the 202122 FY NBE, 20237. The general year-on-year inflation reached 29.3 in June 2023. While the year-on-year food inflation reached 28.0, the non-food inflation was 31.4, with some possible adverse impacts on banks mobilization of deposits from the household sector of the economy ESS, 20238. The financial sector was robust, with growing business volume and accessibility. As the banking sector welcomed eleven new banks, the total number of banks reached 31 and that of their branch networks 11,381, making the competition stiffer. The number of insurance companies and microfinance institutions also grew to 18 and 47, respectively NBE, 20239. Cited Sources 1. International Monetary Fund. 2023.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. A. Group and consolidation The scope of our Group audit was determined by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope on the audit work at all companies operating within the Group. Our audit work was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality. At the Bank level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures. B. Loans and advances There are risks that loans and advances may be given without proper managerial approval may not be accurately recorded do not exist may not be recorded at appropriate values and all bad and doubtful balances may not have been provided for written off. In our response to these risks, we assessed the reasonableness of the design of the system of internal control by enquiring of the relevant Bank personnel and reviewing the documented system developed by the Bank. We tested this system in order to conﬁrm our understanding of it. We identiﬁed the preventive and detective controls. We checked a sample of selected transactions covering the whole year to see that all controls were exercised on all transactions. For a sample of disbursements made during the year, we checked the approval of appropriate level of management and checked that all formalities necessary before disbursement of loans and advances had been fulﬁlled. We test checked loan agreements and legal documents to verify the terms and conditions of loans and advances. We obtained an analysis of loans and veriﬁed that they had been classiﬁed in correct categories and we considered the value of collateral available against each loan for calculating the provision for doubtful loans and advances. Our testing did not identify major weakness in the design and operation of controls that would have required us to expand the nature or scope of our planned detailed test work. Overall, we found no major concerns in respect to the completion of formalities or the recording of loans and advances at appropriate values. Annual Report 202223 13 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE SUPERVISING AUTHORITY OF COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA - Continued Responsibilities of the Director and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRSs, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of ﬁnancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the ﬁnancial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Groups ﬁnancial reporting process. Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these ﬁnancial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁnancial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Groups internal control. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 14 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE SUPERVISING AUTHORITY OF COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA - Continued Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements - Continued We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most signiﬁcance in the audit of the ﬁnancial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest beneﬁts of such communication. The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors report is WoizeroBanchiayehuTamirat. Date 27 December 2023 Conclude on the appropriateness of managements use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signiﬁcant doubt on the Groups ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors report to the related disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements or if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Annual Report 202223 15 STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS RESPONSIBILITY The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of Commercial Bank of Ethiopia The Group, comprising the consolidated statements of ﬁnancial position as at 30 June 2023, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of changes in equity and consolidated statements of cash ﬂows for the year then ended and the notes to the ﬁnancial statements , which include a summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies and other explanatory notes, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.

The Banks registered office is in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and it has 1,939 branches. 2 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The Bank has subsidiaries in Ethiopia, the Republic of Djibouti and the Republic of South Sudan. The consolidated financial statement incorporates the financial statements of the Bank and four entities controlled by the Bank- its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group or individually as Group entities. Control is achieved where the Bank has the power to govern the financial and operation policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 3 BASIS OF PREPARATION a Statement of Compliance The Groups consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB. b Basis of Measurement The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the following significant items 1. Equity instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income 2. Non-current assets held for sale measured at lower of their carrying amounts and fair value less costs to sell and 3. The liability for defined benefit obligations is recognized as the present value of the defined obligation, plus unrecognized actuarial gains less unrecognized past service cost and unrecognized actuarial losses. c Use of Judgments and Estimates In preparing these financial statements, management has made judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Groups accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, including the determination of the best way of presenting information on each page of the Groups financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively. Judgments Information about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognized in the financial statements included in the following note Annual Report 202223 23 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 3 BASIS OF PREPARATION - Continued c Use of Judgments and Estimates - Continued Judgments - Continued Note 4a determination of control over investees. Management used the control model under IFRS 10, to determine whether the control indicators set out in note 4a indicate that the Bank controls a trust, an investment fund or an entity without ownership interest. Assumptions and Estimation Uncertainties Note 4c and l identification and measurement of impairment for financial instruments Note 4g and note 4k useful lives of tangible and intangible assets Note 4o measurement of defined benefits obligations key actuarial assumptions Note 4n and note 4u recognition and measurement of provisions and contingencies Note 4t recognition of deferred taxes and Note 4c vii Fair value measurement of financial instruments. Information on assumptions and uncertainty of estimates posing a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment is presented as follows d Classification and Impairment of Financial Assets The classification of financial assets includes the assessment of the business model within which the assets are held and assessment of whether the contractual terms of the financial asset are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The impairment of financial instruments includes the assessment of whether credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and incorporation of forward-looking information in the measurement of expected credit losses ECL. The measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behaviour e.g. the likelihood of customers defaulting and the resulting losses. Explanation of the inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used in measuring ECL is further detailed in note 4cviii which also sets out key sensitivities of the ECL to changes in these elements. A number of significant judgements are also required in applying the accounting requirements for measuring ECL, such as Determining criteria for significant increase in credit risk Choosing appropriate models and assumptions for the measurement of ECL Establishing the number and relative weightings of forward-looking scenarios for each type of productmarket and the associated ECL and Establishing groups of similar financial assets for the purposes of measuring ECL. Detailed information about the judgements and estimates made by the Group in the above areas is set out in Note 4cviii. e Deferred Tax The Group is subject to income tax under different jurisdictions. Estimates are made through a tax projection for determining the provision for income taxes and liabilities. When the final tax outcome is Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 24 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 3 BASIS OF PREPARATION - Continued e Deferred Tax - Continued different from the amounts that were recorded, differences will impact the provision for income taxes and deferred taxes in the period in which such determination is made See Note 4t. 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in this financial statement. a Details of Consolidation i. Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are investees controlled by the Bank. The Bank controls a subsidiary if it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The Bank reassesses whether it has control if there are changes to one or more of the elements of control. The financial statements s of subsidiaries, as described below, and are included in the financial statements s from the date on which control commences until the date when control ceases. The Banks subsidiaries are as follows Name Principal Place of Business 30 June 2023 30 June2022 Commercial Nominees PLC Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia 100 100 Commercial Bank of Ethiopia- South Sudan Limited The Republic of South Sudan 100 100 Commercial Bank of Ethiopia- Djibouti Limited The Republic of Djibouti 100 100 Bole PrintingEnterprize Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia 100 100 ii. Associates Associates are all entities over which the Bank has significant influence but no control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20 and 50 of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the investments are initially recognized at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize the investors share of profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income OCI is reclassified to profit or loss as appropriate. The Groups share of its associates post-acquisition profits or losses is recognized in profit or loss. When the Groups share of losses in an associate equal or exceeds its interest in the associate, including other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Bank and its associate are recognized in the Banks financial statements only to the extent of unrelated parties interests in the associates.

Transactions Eliminated on Consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra- group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups interest in the investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. b Foreign Currency i Foreign Currency Transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Groups entities at the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between the amortized cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the year, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the year, and the amortized cost in the foreign currency translated at the spot exchange rate at the end of the year. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate at the date on which the fair value is determined. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction. This consolidated financial statement is presented in Ethiopian Birr ETB, which is the Group's functional currency. The loans granted and liabilities contracted are in Ethiopian Birr, which is the currency that predominates in the economic environment where the Group operates. Similarly, the main cash flows for settled goods and services, taxes and other obligations are in Birr. For entities incorporated in Ethiopia the legal currency is the Ethiopian Birr whereas for the entities incorporated in the Republic of South Sudan the legal currency is the South Sudanese pound while Djibouti Franc is the legal currency in the Republic of Djibouti. ii Foreign Operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into Ethiopian Birr ETB at the spot exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Ethiopian Birr ETB using an average rate for the period. Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income OCI, and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve. c Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities i Recognition and Initial Measurement The Group initially recognises loans and advances, deposits and debt securities on the date at which they are originated. All other financial assets and liabilities including assets designated at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised on the trade date on which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provision of the instrument. Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 26 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued c Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Continued i Recognition and Initial Measurement - Continued A financial asset or liability is initially measured at fair value plus for an item not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. Subsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities deposits and debt securities are measured at their amortized cost using the effective interest method. ii Classification and Measurement Classification and Measurement of Financial Assets On initial recognition, financial assets are classified into one of the following measurement categories Amortisedcost Fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI Fair value through profit or loss FVTPL Elected at fair value through other comprehensive income equities only or Designated at FVTPL. Financial assets include both debt and equity instruments. A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by- investment basis. All other financial assets are classified as measured at FVTPL. In addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. Debt instruments, including loans and debt securities, are classified into one of the following measurement categories Amortisedcost Fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI Fair value through profit or loss FVTPL or Designated at FVTPL. Annual Report 202223 27 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued c Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Continued ii Classification and Measurement - Continued Classification of debt instruments is determined based on i The business model under which the asset is held and ii The contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument. Business Model Assessment Business model assessment involves determining how financial assets are managed in order to generate cash flows. The Groups business model assessment is based on the following categories Held to collect The objective of the business model is to hold assets and collect contractual cash flows. Any sales of the asset are incidental to the objective of the model. Held to collect and for sale Both collecting contractual cash flows and sales are integral to achieving the objectives of the business model. Other business model The business model is neither held-to-collect nor held-to-collect and for sale. The Group makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes The stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular, whether managements strategy focuses on earning contractual interest revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets How the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Groups management The risks that affect the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model and how those risks are managed How managers of the business are compensated e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected and The frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Groups stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised. Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. Assessment Whether Contractual Cash Flows Is Solely Payments of Principal and Interest The contractual cash flow characteristics assessment involves assessing the contractual features of an instrument to determine if they give rise to cash flows that are consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement if they represent cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding SPPI. For the purposes of this assessment, principal is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. Interest is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs, as well as profit margin. Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 28 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued c Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Continued ii Classification and Measurement - Continued Assessment Whether Contractual Cash Flows Is Solely Payments of Principal and Interest - Continued In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Group considers Contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows Leveragefeatures Prepayment and extensionterms Terms that limit the Groups claim to cash flows from specified assets e.g. non-recourse asset arrangements and Features that modify consideration of the time value of money e.g. periodical reset of interest rates. The Group holds a portfolio of long-term fixed rate loans for which the Bank has the option to propose to revise the interest rate at periodic reset dates. These reset rights are limited to the market rate at the time of revision. The borrowers have an option to either accept the revised rate or redeem the loan at par without penalty. The Group has determined that the contractual cash flows of these loans are solely payments of principal and interest because the option varies the interest rate in a way that is consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and costs associated with the principal amount outstanding. Debt instruments measured at amortized cost Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost if they are held within a business model whose objective is to hold for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. After initial measurement, debt instruments in this category are carried at amortized cost. Interest income on these instruments is recognized in interest income using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition, transaction costs and fees that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Impairment on debt instruments measured at amortized cost is calculated using the expected credit loss approach. Loans and debt securities measured at amortized cost are presented net of the allowance for credit losses ACL in the statement of financial position. Debt instruments measured at FVOCI Debt instruments are measured at FVOCI if they are held within a business model whose objective is to hold for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling financial assets, where the assets cash flows represent payments that are solely payments of principal and interest. Subsequent to initial recognition, unrealized gains and losses on debt instruments measured at FVOCI are recorded in other comprehensive income OCI, unless the instrument is designated in a fair value hedge relationship. When designated in a fair value hedge relationship, any changes in fair value due to changes in the hedged risk are recognized in Non-interest income in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Annual Report 202223 29 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued c Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Continued ii Classification and Measurement - Continued Assessment Whether Contractual Cash Flows Is Solely Payments of Principal and Interest - Continued Debt instruments measured at FVOCI - Continued Comprehensive Income. Upon derecognition, realized gains and losses are reclassified from OCI and recorded in Non-interest income in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income on an average cost basis. Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to the amortized cost of the debt instrument are recognized in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. Premiums, discounts and related transaction costs are amortized over the expected life of the instrument to Interest income in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income using the effective interest rate method. Impairment on debt instruments measured at FVOCI is calculated using the expected credit loss approach. The ACL on debt instruments measured at FVOCI does not reduce the carrying amount of the asset in the Statement of Financial Position, which remains at its fair value. Instead, an amount equal to the allowance that would arise if the assets were measured at amortised cost is recognised in OCI with a corresponding charge to Provision for credit losses in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. The accumulated allowance recognised in OCI is recycled to the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income upon derecognition of the debt instrument. Debt instruments measured at FVTPL Debt instruments are measured at FVTPL if assets i Are held for trading purposes ii Are held as part of a portfolio managed on a fair value basis or iii Whose cash flows do not represent payments that are solely payments of principal and interest. These instruments are measured at fair value in the Statement of Financial Position, with transaction costs recognized immediately in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income as part of Non-interest income. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized as part of Non- interest income in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. Debt instruments designated at FVTPL Financial assets classified in this category are those that have been designated by the Group upon initial recognition, and once designated, the designation is irrevocable. The FVTPL designation is available only for those financial assets for which a reliable estimate of fair value can be obtained. Financial assets are designated at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch which would otherwise arise. Financial assets designated at FVTPL are recorded in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized in Non-interest income in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. Equity instruments Equity instruments are classified into one of the following measurement categories Fair value through profit or loss FVTPL or Elected at fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI. Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 30 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued c Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Continued ii Classification and Measurement - Continued Assessment Whether Contractual Cash Flows Is Solely Payments of Principal and Interest - Continued Equity instruments measured at FVTPL Equity instruments are measured at FVTPL, unless an election is made to designate them at FVOCI upon purchase, with transaction costs recognized immediately in the Statement of profit or loss and other comprhensive income as part of Non-interest income. Subsequent to initial recognition the changes in fair value are recognized as part of Non-interest income in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. Equity instruments measured at FVOCI At initial recognition, there is an irrevocable option for the Group to classify non-trading equity instruments at FVOCI. This election is used for certain equity investments for strategic or longer-term investment purposes. This election is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is not available to equity instruments that are held for trading purposes. Gains and losses on these instruments including when derecognizedsold are recorded in OCI and are not subsequently reclassified to the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. As such, there is no specific impairment requirement. Dividends received are recorded in Interest income in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. Any transaction costs incurred upon purchase of the security are added to the cost basis of the security and are not reclassified to the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income on sale of the security. Reclassifications Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets. Classification and Measurement of Financial Liabilities The Group classifies its financial liabilities, other than financial guarantees and loan commitments, as measured at amortised cost. iii Derecognition Financial Assets The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognized and the sum of i the consideration received including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed and ii any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in OCI is recognized in profit or loss. Annual Report 202223 31 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued c Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Continued iii Derecognition - Continued Financial Assets - Continued Any cumulative gainloss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI is not recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities. Any interest in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability. In transactions in which the Group neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset and it retains control over the asset, the Group continues to recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset. Financial Liabilities The Group derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. iv Modifications of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Financial Assets If the terms of a financial asset are modified, the Group evaluates whether the cash flows of the modified asset are substantially different. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognized and a new financial asset is recognized at fair value. If the terms of a financial asset were modified because of financial difficulties of the borrower and the asset was not derecognized, then impairment of the asset was measured using the pre-modification interest rate. Financial Liabilities The Group derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability with modified terms is recognized in profit or loss. v Offsetting Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intents either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS, or for gains and losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Groups trading activity. vi Amortized Cost Measurement The amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition, minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between the initial amount recognized and the maturity amount, minus any reduction for impairment. Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 32 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued c Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Continued vii Fair Value Measurement Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk. When available, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Group uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. There is no active market or observable prices except for foreign currency market to measure the Groups financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value. Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is determined at each reporting date for disclosure in the financial statement purposes only. viii Impairment The Group recognises loss allowances for ECL on the following financial instruments that are not measured at FVTPL Financial assets that are debt instruments Lease receivables Financial guarantee contracts issued and Loan commitments issued. No impairment loss is recognised on equity investments. The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to life time ECL, except for the following, for which they are measured as 12-month ECL Debt investment securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and Other financial instruments other than lease receivables on which credit risk has not increased significantly since their initial recognition see Note 3a. Loss allowances for lease receivables are always measured at an amount equal to life time ECL.The Group considers a debt security to have low credit risk when their credit risk rating is equivalent to the globally understood definition of investment grade. 12-month ECLs are the portion of ECL that results from default events on a financial instrument that is possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Measurement of ECL ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. They are measured as follows Financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date as the present value of all cash shortfalls i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive Annual Report 202223 33 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued c Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Continued viii Impairment - Continued Measurement of ECL - Continued Financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date as the difference between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows Undrawn loan commitments as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Group if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive and Financial guarantee contracts the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that the Group expects to recover. See also Note 4a. Restructured Financial Assets If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made of whether the financial asset should be derecognised see note 4cviii and ECL are measured as follows. If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, and then the expected cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset. If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset. Credit-impaired Financial Assets At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt financial assets carried at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer a breach of contract such as a default or past due event the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisationor In Existanceof an active market for a security because of financial difficulties. A loan that has been renegotiated due to deterioration in the borrowers condition is usually considered to be credit-impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered impaired. In making an assessment of whether an investment in sovereign debt is credit-impaired, the Group considers the following factors The rating agencies assessments of credit worthiness The countrys ability to access the capital markets for new debt issuance Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 34 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued c Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Continued viii Impairment - Continued Credit-impaired Financial Assets - Continued The probability of debt being restructured, resulting in holders suffering losses through voluntary or mandatory debt forgiveness The international support mechanisms in place to provide the necessary support as lender of last resort to that country, as well as the intention, reflected in public statements, of governments and agencies to use those mechanisms. This includes an assessment of the depth of those mechanisms and, irrespective of the political intent, whether there is the capacity to fulfil the required criteria. Presentation of Allowance for ECL in the Statement of Financial Position Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the statement of financial position as follows Financial assetsmeasured at amortised cost as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets Loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts generally, as a provision Where a financial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Group cannot identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from those on the drawn component the Group presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The combined amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision and Debt instruments measured at FVOCI no loss allowance is recognised in the statement of financial position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance is disclosed and is recognised in the fair value reserve. Write-off Loans and debt securities are written off either partially or in full when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Banks procedures for recovery of amounts due. d Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash comprise cash on hand, placements with other banks, cash reserve with the National Bank of Ethiopia, payment and settlement account with the National Bank of Ethiopia and Cash in Transit. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in values. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost in the statement of financial position e Loans and Advances Loans and advances are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and that the Group does not intend to sell immediately or in the near term. Annual Report 202223 35 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued f Debt Securities Government securities and coupons and corporate bonds are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity that the Group has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, and which are not designated as at fair value through profit or loss. They are measured at amortized cost-plus accrued interest. g Property, Plant and Equipment i Recognition and Measurement Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, which includes capitalized borrowing costs, less accumulated depreciation and cumulative impairment losses. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalized as part of that equipment. If significant parts of an item of property or equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items major components of property and equipment. Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognized net within operating and administrative expenses in profit or loss. ii Subsequent Costs Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it is probable that the future economic benefits of the expenditure will flow to the Group. Minor ongoing repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. iii Depreciation Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property and equipment less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and is generally recognized in profit or loss. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation is charged on the straight line basis at the following rates per annum. Building 5 Computer equipment 25 Fixtures, fittings and equipment 20 Motor vehicles 20 Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted if appropriate. Minor repairs and maintenance costs are expense as incurred. h Inventory The Group maintains materials or supplies to be consumed in the rendering of services as inventory and measure at lower of cost or Net realizable value. Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 36 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued i Leases - Continued i Group Acting as a Lessee - Continued The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset at cost and a lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group used the lessees incremental borrowing rate. After the commencement date, the Group measures the right-of-use asset applying a cost model cost less any cumulative depreciation and any cumulative impairment. In the case of the lease liability, the Group measure it by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made, and re-measuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Group exempt to apply the requirement for short term leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. ii Bank Acting as a Lessor Finance Leases Where the Group is the lessor, the Group classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. Finance Lease With a lease agreement that transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset to the lessee, then the arrangement is classified as a finance lease and a receivable equal to the net investment in the lease is recognized and presented within receivable. The Group recognizes assets held under a finance lease in its statement of financial position and present them as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. After the initial measurement, the Group recognizes finance income over the lease term, based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessors net investment in the lease. Operating Lease A lease agreement that does not transfer substantially the entire risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of the asset to the lease is classified as an operating lease. The Group recognizes lease payments from operating leases as income on either a straight-line basis or another systematic basis. The Group applies another systematic basis if that basis is more representative of the pattern in which benefit from the use of the underlying asset is diminished. j Investment Property Investment property is property held either to earn rental income, capital appreciation, or both, and is not intended to be sold in the normal course of business. All investment properties are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation and cumulative impairment losses. When the use of a property changes such that it is reclassified as property plant and equipment, its carrying value at the date of reclassification becomes its cost for subsequent accounting. k Non-current Assets Held for Sale Non-Current assets held for sale correspond to Acquire assets such as real estate and moveable property foreclosed in the absence of repayment of loans due to the Group. This type of non-current Annual Report 202223 37 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -Continued k Non-current Assets Held for Sale - Continued available-for-sale assets are expected to be recovered mainly through sale and not through continued use. The value of these assets is updated through an internal appraisal made within three months of the date on which the Group acquires ownership therefore, if the appraisal value is less than carrying value, a valuation reserve is created and charged to the years income. Subsequently, the available-for-sale assets or group of assets are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses in the initial classification of available- for-sale assets and subsequent gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss. If the sale is paid up-front and the amount recovered exceeds the carrying amount, the difference is directly recorded in the years income. If it is a sale to be paid in installments, and the amount to be recovered exceeds the carrying amount, the difference is accounted for as deferred income, and accrued as installments are collected. If the recovered amount is less than the carrying amount, the loss is charged to income, irrespective of the sale is paid up-front or in installments. l Intangible assets Software Software acquired by the Group is measured at cost less accumulated amortization and any impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure on software assets is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred. Software is amortized on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over its estimated useful life, from the date on which it is available for use. The estimated useful life of software for the current and comparative periods is four years. Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted as found appropriate. m Impairment of Non-financial Assets At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets other than deferred tax assets to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that is largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or Cash Generating Unit CGUs. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 38 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued m Impairment of Non-financial Assets - Continued The Groups corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are used by more than one CGU. Corporate assets are allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the CGUs to which the corporate assets are allocated. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. n Deposits from Banks and Customers Deposits and borrowings are the Groups sources of debt funding. These liabilities are initially measured at fair value minus incremental direct transaction costs, and subsequently measured at their amortized cost using the effective interest method. o Provisions A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. p Employee Benefits i- Defined Benefit Plans A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan at the termination of the employment relationship, other than a defined contribution plan. The Group accounts not only its legal obligation under the formal term described above, also for any constructive obligation that arises from the Group s customary practices. A customary practice gives rise to a constructive obligation where the Group has no realistic alternatives but to pay employee benefits. The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and any unrecognized past service costs are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on governmental bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognized immediately in profit or loss. The Group recognizes all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Annual Report 202223 39 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued p Employee Benefits - Continued ii-Short-term Benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related services are provided, current wages including medical expenses, being taken into consideration. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid and includes mainly wages and salaries, bonuses, leave benefits and other allowances, and incentives as a result of past services provided by the employees, and the obligation can be estimated reliably. iii-Termination Benefits According to Law, in case of unjustified dismissal, employers are obligated to pay to their employees compensation based on the years of service. q Legal Reserve The legal reserve is a statutory reserve required by the regulators. TheBank has to transfer annually 25 of its annual net profit as a legal reserveuntil such reserve equals its capital. When the legal reserve equals the capital of the Bank, the amount to be transferred to the legal reserve shall be 10 of the annual net profit. For Commercial Nominees PLC and Bole printintinginterprise PLC 5 of the net profit until the accumulated legal reserve balance amounts to 10 of the issued share capital according to commercial code of Ethiopia Article 454. r Revenue and Expense Recognition Interest income and expense are recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to The gross carrying amount of the financial assets or The amortized cost of the financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments other than credit-impaired assets, the Bank estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not future credit losses. For credit-impaired financial assets, a credit adjusted effective interest rate is calculating using estimated future cash flows including incurred credit losses. The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transactions costs, fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability. Gross Carrying Amount and Amortised Cost The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortized cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.The amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance or impairment allowance. Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 40 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued r Revenue and Expense Recognition - Continued Calculation of Interest Income and Expenses In calculating interest income and expenses, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset when the asset is not credit-impaired or to the amortized cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis. For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the asset. The calculation of interest income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves. Presentation of Interest Income and Expenses Interest income and expense presented in the statement of profit or loss and OCI include Interest on financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost calculated on an effective interest basis Interest on debt instruments measured at FVOCI calculated on an effective interest basis The effective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivatives designated in cash flow hedges of variability in interest cash flows, in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect interest incomeexpense and The effective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivatives designated in fair value hedges of interest rate risk. Interest income and expense on all trading assets and liabilities are considered to be incidental to the Banks trading operations and are presented together with all other changes in the fair value of trading assets and liabilities in net trading income. Interest income and expense on other financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL are presented in net income from other financial instruments at FVTPL s Fees and Commissions Fees and commission income and expense that are integral to the effective interest rate on a financial asset or financial liability are included in the measurement of the effective interest rate. Other fees and commission income relate mainly to commissions on local money transfers LMTS, guarantee commission, outward remittance, card charges, and commission on import letter of credit are recognized as the related services are performed.Other fees and commission expense relate mainly to transaction and service fees, which are expensed as the services are received. The Group recognises revenue when satisfy its performance obligation. The Groups revenue from contracts with customer is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. It is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment. Annual Report 202223 41 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued t Dividend Income Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive income is established. Dividends are presented in net trading income, net income from other financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss or other revenue based on the underlying classification of the equity investment. u Income Tax Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity or in OCI. a Current Tax The current income tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable is the best estimate of tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects the uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. b Deferred Tax Deferred tax is measured under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between such values. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to temporary differences when recovered or settled in each of the jurisdictions where the subsidiaries of the Bank operate, based on laws enacted or substantially enacted as of the reporting date. No deferred taxes are recognized for the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and to the same fiscal entity or on different tax entities, but the intent is to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which such can be reversed. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. v Contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount thereof can be reasonably estimated. When a reasonable estimation cannot be made, disclosure is provided in the NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Contingent revenues, earnings or assets are not recognized until realization is assured. w New Standards, Amendments and Interpretations A number of new standards, amendments to standard and interpretations are not yet effective for the period ended 30 June 2023 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. These are summarized as follows Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 42 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued w New Standards, Amendments and Interpretations - Continued Standards Interpretations Effective for Annual Periods Beginning on or After Onerous Contracts Cost of Fulfilling a Contract IAS 37 amendment 1 July 2022 Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018 2020 IFRS 1, IFRS 9, IFRS 16 and IAS 41 amendments 1 July 2022 Property, Plant and Equipment Proceeds before Intended Use IAS 16 amendment 1 July 2022 Reference to the Conceptual Framework IFRS 3 amendment 1 July 2022 Insurance Contracts IFRS 17 1 July 2023 Insurance Contracts IFRS 17 amendments 1 July 2023 Classification of liabilities as current or non-current IAS 1 amendment 1 July 2023 Definition of Accounting Estimates IAS 8 amendment 1 July 2023 Disclosure Initiative Accounting Policies IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 amendment 1 July 2023 Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction IAS 12 amendment 1 July 2023 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture IFRS 10 and IAS 28 amendment Deferred indefinitely by amendments made in December 2015 IFRS 17 is not applicable to the business of the Bank and will therefore have no impact on future financial statements. The directors are of the opinion that the impact of the application of the remaining Standards and Interpretations will be as follows Onerous Contracts Cost of Fulfilling a Contract Amendments to IAS 37 Amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, clarify that the 'costs of fulfilling a contract' when assessing whether a contract is onerous comprises both The incremental costs e.g. direct labour and materials and An allocation of other direct costs e.g. an allocation of the depreciation charge for an item of property, plant and equipment used in fulfilling the contract. The amendments apply for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2022 to contracts existing at the date when the amendments are first applied. At the date of initial application, the cumulative effect of applying the amendments will be recognised as an opening balance adjustment to retained earnings or other component of equity, as appropriate. The comparatives will not be restated. Earlier application is permitted. Annual Report 202223 43 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards The amendment permits a subsidiary as a first-time adopter of IFRS that applies IFRS later than its parent that applies IFRS 1. D16a to measure cumulative translation differences using the amounts reported by its parent, based on the parents date of transition to IFRSs. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments The amendment clarifies that for the purpose of performing the 10 per cent test for derecognition of financial liabilities in determining those fees paid net of fees received, a borrower includes only fees paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the others behalf. IFRS 16 Leases The amendment removes the illustration of payments from the lessor relating to leasehold improvements. As currently drafted, this example is not clear as to why such payments are not a lease incentive. IAS 41 Agriculture The amendment removes the requirement to exclude cash flows for taxation when measuring fair value, thereby aligning the fair value measurement requirements in IAS 41 with those in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2022 with earlier application permitted. This did not have an impact on the Groups financial statements. Property, Plant and Equipment Proceeds before Intended Use Amendments to IAS 16 The amendment prohibits deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds from selling items produced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Instead, an entity recognises the proceeds from selling such items, and the cost of producing those items, in profit or loss. Proceeds from selling items before the related item of property, plant and equipment is available for use should be recognised in profit or loss, together with the costs of producing those items. IAS 2 Inventories should be applied in identifying and measuring these production costs. Companies will therefore need to distinguish between Costs associated with producing and selling items before the item of property, plant and equipment is available for use and Costs associated with making the item of property, plant and equipment available for its intended use. Making this allocation of costs may require significant estimation and judgement. The amendments apply for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2022, with earlier application permitted. The amendments apply retrospectively, but only to items of property, plant and 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued w New Standards, Amendments and Interpretations - Continued The Bank will make an assessment of the impact of this adoption. Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 44 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued w New Standards, Amendments and Interpretations - Continued Property, Plant and Equipment Proceeds before Intended Use Amendments to IAS 16 - Continued equipment made available for use on or after the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements in which the company first applies the amendments. The standards are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions. Reference to the Conceptual Framework Amendments to IFRS 3 The amendment has Updated IFRS 3 so that it refers to the 2018 Conceptual Framework instead of the 1989 Framework Added to IFRS 3 a requirement that, for transactions and other events within the scope of IAS 37 or IFRIC 21, an acquirer applies IAS 37 or IFRIC 21 instead of the Conceptual Framework to identify the liabilities it has assumed in a business combination and Added to IFRS 3 an explicit statement that an acquirer does not recognise contingent assets acquired in a business combination. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2022. Early application is permitted if an entity also applies all other updated references published together with the updated Conceptual Framework at the same time or earlier. IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and Its Related Amendments IFRS 17 supersedes IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and aims to increase comparability and transparency about profitability. The new standard introduces a new comprehensive model general model for the recognition and measurement of liabilities arising from insurance contracts. In addition, it includes a simplified approach and modifications to the general measurement model that can be applied in certain circumstances and to specific contracts, such as Reinsurance contracts held Direct participating contracts and Investment contracts with discretionary participation features. Under the new standard, investment components are excluded from insurance revenue and service expenses. Entities can also choose to present the effect of changes in discount rates and other financial risks in profit or loss or OCI. The new standard includes various new disclosures and requires additional granularity in disclosures to assist users to assess the effects of insurance contracts on the entitys financial statements. The entity is in the process of determining the impact of IFRS 17 and will provide more detailed disclosure on the impact in future financial statements. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2023. Early adoption is permitted only if the entity applied IFRS 9. These standards are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions. Annual Report 202223 45 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued w New Standards, Amendments and Interpretations - Continued Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current Amendments to IAS 1 Under existing IAS 1 requirements, companies classify a liability as current when they do not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the end of the reporting period. As part of its amendments, the Board has removed the requirement for a right to be unconditional and instead, now requires that a right to defer settlement must have substance and exist at the end of the reporting period. There is limited guidance on how to determine whether a right has substance and the assessment may require management to exercise interpretive judgement. The existing requirement to ignore managements intentions or expectations for settling a liability when determining its classification is unchanged. The amendments are to be applied retrospectively from the effective date. The Bank will make an assessment of the impact of this adoption. Definition of Accounting Estimates Amendments to IAS 8 Distinguishing between accounting policies and accounting estimates is important because changes in accounting policies are generally applied retrospectively, while changes in accounting estimates are applied prospectively. The changes to IAS 8 focus entirely on accounting estimates and clarify the following The definition of a change in accounting estimates is replaced with a definition of accounting estimates Under the new definition, accounting estimates are monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty. Entities develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require items in financial statements to be measured in a way that involves measurement uncertainty. The Board clarified that a change in accounting estimate that results from new information or new developments is not the correction of an error. In addition, the effects of a change in an input or a measurement technique used to develop an accounting estimate are changes in accounting estimates if they do not result from the correction of prior period errors. A change in an accounting estimate may affect only the current periods profit or loss, or the profit or loss of both the current period and future periods. The effect of the change relating to the current period is recognised as income or expense in the current period. The effect, if any, on future periods is recognised as income or expense in those future periods. The effects of changes in inputs andor measurement techniques are changes in accounting estimates. The definition of accounting policies remains unchanged. The amendments are effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2023, with earlier application permitted, and will apply prospectively to changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies occurring on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period in which the company applies the amendments.The standards are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups current or future reporting periods. Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 46 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued w New Standards, Amendments and Interpretations - Continued Disclosure Initiative Accounting Policies Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making information in financial statements more relevant and less cluttered has been one of the key focus areas for the International Accounting Standards Board the Board. The Board has issued amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and an update to IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements to help companies provide useful accounting policy disclosures. The key amendments to IAS 1 include Requiring companies to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies Several paragraphs are added to explain how an entity can identify material accounting policy information and to give examples of when accounting policy information is likely to be material Clarifying that accounting policies related to immaterial transactions, other events or conditions are themselves immaterial and as such need not be disclosed Clarifying that not all accounting policies that relate to material transactions, other events or conditions are themselves material to a companys financial statements Accounting policy information may be material because of its nature, even if the related amounts are immaterial Accounting policy information is material if users of an entitys financial statements would need it to understand other material information in the financial statements and The amendments clarify that if an entity discloses immaterial accounting policy information such information shall not obscure material accounting policy information. The Board also amended IFRS Practice Statement 2 to include guidance and two additional examples on the application of materiality to accounting policy disclosures. The amendments are consistent with the refined definition of material. The amendments are effective from 1 July 2023 but may be applied earlier. The Bank will make an assessment of the impact of this adoption. Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction Amendment to IAS 12 The amendment clarifies that the initial recognition exemption does not apply to transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences such as leases and decommissioning obligations. As a result, companies will need to recognise a deferred tax asset and a deferred tax liability for temporary differences arising on initial recognition of a lease and a decommissioning provision The Bank will make an assessment of the impact of this adoption. Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and Its Associate or Joint Venture Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 The amendments require the full gain to be recognised when assets transferred between an investor and its associate or joint venture meet the definition of a business under IFRS 3 Business Combinations. Where the assets transferred do not meet the definition of a business, a partial gain to the extent of unrelated investors interests in the associate or joint venture is recognised. The definition of a business is key to determining the extent of the gain to be recognised. Annual Report 202223 47 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued w New Standards, Amendments and Interpretations - Continued Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and Its Associate or Joint Venture Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 - Continued When a parent loses control of a subsidiary in a transaction with an associate or joint venture JV, there is a conflict between the existing guidance on consolidation and equity accounting. Under the consolidation standard, the parent recognises the full gain on the loss of control. But under the standard on associates and JVs, the parent recognises the gain only to the extent of unrelated investors interests in the associate or JV. In either case, the loss is recognised in full if the underlying assets are impaired. In response to this conflict and the resulting diversity in practice, on 11 September 2014 the IASB issued Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28. The IASB has decided to defer the effective date for these amendments indefinitely. Adoption is still permitted. A number of new standards and ammendments to satndards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2022 and earlier application is permitted, however, the Group has not yet early adopted the new and amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial satements. The following new and amended standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements. Classification of Liablities as Current or Non current Amendments to IAS 1. IFRS 17 Insurance contracts and ammendments to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts. Lease liability in a Sale and Leaseback Amendments to IFRS 16. Definition of Accounting estimates Amendments to IAS 8. In addition to this, the bank will include all new or amended standards and their possible impact on the consolidated financial statements. 5 FINANCIAL RISK REVIEW The Group is exposed to the following financial risks from financial instruments, for which it conducts regular risk management efforts Credit risk Liquidity risk Market risk Capital management Operational risk This note presents information about the Banks exposure to each of the above risks, and Companys objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risks. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout separate financial statement. Risk Management Framework The Board of Directors of the Bank has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of theBanks risk management framework. The Board has established the Loan and Risk Review Committee LRRC through the Loan and Risk Review Committee charter, which is responsible for providing the standards and minimum parameters to be followed in managing the banks exposure to risk. Besides, it is also responsible for developing and monitoring effectiveness of the Banks risk management policies and the degree of compliance to national and international regulatory standards. Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 48 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 5 FINANCIAL RISK REVIEW - Continued Risk Management Framework - Continued The LLRC reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities. The Banks risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Bank, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to those limits. The risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Banks activities. The Bank through its training management standards and procedures aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all the employees understand their roles and obligations. The Board Audit Committee of Commercial Bank of Ethiopia oversees how management monitors compliance with the Banks risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risk faced by the Bank. The Banks Board Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit function. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Banks Audit Committee. In addition, the Bank is subject to the regulations of the National Bank of Ethiopia with respect to, among others matters, comprehensive risk management, liquidity and capitalization. a Credit Risk The following table sets out information about the credit quality of financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI debt investments.

Loans and advances fully secured by cash and cash substitute, regardless of the loan status. The borrower has strong repayment capacity, excellent track records in servicing debt regularly, and is not subject to criticism. Grade 2 They are classified as very low risk borrowers, if they meet the following criteria during the issuance of credit risk grade. These borrowers are not as strong as grade 1 borrowers in terms of credit risk parameters. The borrower has strong repayment capacity. The borrower has excellent liquidity and low leverage. The business demonstrates consistently strong earnings and cash flows. The borrower has well established and strong market share. CBE has confidence on the management of the business. The loan is performing in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract. Grade 3 These borrowers are considered as low risk borrowers, being capable of meeting the following criteria. Not as strong as the grade 2 in terms of credit risk parameters, but the business still demonstrates consistent earnings, cash flow and have good track record. The borrower has adequate liquidity, cash flow and earnings. The borrower has acceptable share in the market. The business has acceptable management capability. The business is performing in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract. Grade 4 These borrowers are rated as moderate risk borrowers given the fact that they demonstrate the following features when the grade is issued. They are not as strong as Grade 3 in terms of credit risk parameters. The loans and advances show sign of irregularity, or have arrears the credit facilities have been inactive. The borrower needs attention due to conditions affecting the business, the industry, or the economic environment. The borrower has above average risk due to strained liquidity, higher than normal leverage, thin cash flow andor inconsistent earning. The borrower may incur loss. Grade 5 They are debtors with potential risk witnessed by the following results from the credit risk grading analysis. Lower than grade 4 in terms of credit risk parameters. The borrower has potential weaknesses that deserve CBEs close attention. If left uncorrected, these weaknesses may result in a deterioration of the repayment prospects of the borrower. Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 52 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 5 FINANCIAL RISK REVIEW - Continued a Credit Risk - Continued The loans and advance show extended irregularities, or have the arrears the credit facilities have been inactive. Severe management problem exists. Credit facilities should be downgraded to this grade if sustained deterioration in financial condition is noted consecutive losses, negative net worth and excessive leverage. Grade 6 These are high risk borrowers. Financial condition is weak and capacity or inclination to repay is in doubt. These weaknesses jeopardized full settlement of credit facilities. Grade 7 very high risk borrowers Full repayment of principal and interest is unlikely and the possibility of loss is extremely high. However, due to especially identifiable pending factors, such as litigation, liquidation procedures and capital injection, the asset is not yet classified as loss. Grade 8 default risk The loan has been long outstanding with no progress in obtaining repayment or on the verge of liquidationwind up. Prospect of recovery is poor and legal options have been pursued or initiated. Proceeds expected from the liquidation or realization of security may be awaited. CBEs criteria for timely write-off shall be adhered to apply. In order to classify the outstanding loans according to the risk grade of debtor, the following assumptions are used because of the fact that retail loans are not regularly graded except at the initial stage of the credit assessment. Loan disbursed to Business, Corporate and Commercial customers are presented according to their risk grade from the risk grading analysis. Emergency staff loan, staff personal loan and staff mortgage loan are assigned grade 1 because of the fact that such loans are regularly repaid from salary account of the staff without any delinquency and arrears. All loans and that are unrated assumed to be graded as follows All ungraded Pass status retail loans are assigned with grade 2. All ungraded Special Mention status retail loans are assigned with risk grade 3. All ungraded Sub-standard status retail loans are assigned with risk grade 5. All ungraded Doubtful status retail loans are assigned with risk grade 6. All ungraded Loss status retail loans are assigned with risk grade 7. All loans and advances under litigation decision ALD are assigned with risk grade 8. The risk grade classification and the underlying assumptions are made based on the analysis of the repayment trend of retail borrowers and default history in the Bank over the past five years. The Bank has implemented a series of credit procedures and reports for assessing the performance of its portfolio, the requirements of provisions and, especially, for anticipating events that may affect its debtors future condition.

Significant Increase in Credit Risk When determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Bank considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information an analysis, based on the Banks historical experience and expert credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The objective of the assessment is to identify whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred for an exposure by comparing The remaining lifetime probability of default PD as at the reporting date with The remaining lifetime PD for this point in time that was estimated at the time of initial recognition of the exposure adjusted where relevant for changes in prepayment expectations. Credit Risk Grading The Bank has applied the days past due approach to determine the credit risk grading for financial assets classified at amortised cost for purposes of estimating PDs. Generating the Term Structure of PD Credit risk grades are a primary input into the determination of the term structure of PD for exposures. The Bank collects performance and default information about its credit risk exposures analysed by economic sector. The Bank employs statistical models to analyse the data collected and generate estimates of the remaining lifetime PD of exposures and how these are expected to change as a result of the passage of time. This analysis includes the identification and calibration of relationships between changes in default rates and changes in key macro-economic factors as well as in-depth analysis of the impact of certain other factors e.g. forbearance experience on the risk of default. For most exposures, key macro- economic indicators include GDP growth, benchmark interest rates and exchange rate. Based on advice from the Risk Committees and economic experts and consideration of a variety of external actual and forecast information, the Bank formulates a base case view of the future direction of relevant economic variables as well as a representative range of other possible forecast scenarios see discussion below on incorporation of forward-looking information. The Bank then uses these forecasts to adjust its estimates of PDs. Determining whether Credit Risk Has Increased Significantly The criteria for determining whether credit risk has increased significantly vary by portfolio and include quantitative changes in PDs and qualitative factors, including a backstop based on delinquency. Annual Report 202223 55 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 5 Financial Risk Review - Continued a Credit Risk - Continued Determining whether Credit Risk Has Increased Significantly - Continued The credit risk of a particular exposure is deemed to have increased significantly since initial recognition if, based on the Banks quantitative modelling, the days past due excedes 30 days. Using its expert credit judgement and, where possible, relevant historical experience, the Bank may determine that an exposure has undergone a significant increase in credit risk based on particular qualitative indicators that it considers are indicative of such and whose effect may not otherwise be fully reflected in its quantitative analysis on a timely basis. As a backstop, the Bank considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when an asset is more than 30 days past due. Day past due are determined by counting the number of days since the earliest elapsed due date in respect of which full payment has not been received. Due dates are determined without considering any grace period that might be available to the borrower. The Bank monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify significant increases in credit risk by regular reviews to confirm that - The criteria are capable of identifying significant increases in credit risk before an exposure is in default - The criteria do not align with the point in time when an asset becomes 30 days past due and - There is no unwarranted volatility in loss allowance from transfers between 12-month PDstage 1 and lifetime PD stage 2. Modified Financial Assets The contractual terms of a loan may be modified for a number of reasons, including changing market conditions, customer retention and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of the customer. An existing loan whose terms have been modified may be derecognised and the renegotiated loan recognised as a new loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy set out in note 4. When the terms of a financial asset are modified and the modification does not result in derecognition, the determination of whether the assets credit risk has increased significantly reflects comparison of Its remaining lifetime PD at the reporting date based on the modified terms with The remaining lifetime PD estimated based on data at initial recognition and the originalcontractual terms. The Bank renegotiates loans to customers in financial difficulties referred to as forbearance activities to maximise collection opportunities and minimise the risk of default. Under the Banks forbearance policy, loan forbearance is granted on a selective basis if the debtor is currently in default on its debt or if there is a high risk of default, there is evidence that the debtor made all reasonable efforts to pay under the original contractual terms and the debtor is expected to be able to meet the revised terms. The revised terms usually include extending the maturity, changing the timing of interest payments and amending the terms of loan covenants. Both retail and corporate loans are subject to the forbearance policy. The Bank Audit Committee regularly reviews reports on forbearance activities. Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 56 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 5 Financial Risk Review - Continued a Credit Risk - Continued Modified Financial Assets - Continued For financial assets modified as part of the Banks forbearance policy, the estimate of PD reflects whether the modification has improved or restored the Banks ability to collect interest and principal and the Banks previous experience of similar forbearance action. As part of this process, the Bank evaluates the borrowers payment performance against the modified contractual terms and considers various behavioural indicators. Generally, forbearance is a qualitative indicator of a significant increase in credit risk and an expectation of forbearance may constitute evidence that an exposure is credit-impaired in default. A customer needs to demonstrate consistently good payment behaviour over a period of time before the exposure is no longer considered to be credit-impaired in default or the PD is considered to have decreased such that the loss allowance reverts to being measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECL. Definition of Default The Bank considers a financial asset to be in default when The borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank in full, without recourse by the Bank to actions such as realising security if any is held or The borrower is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the Bank. Overdrafts are considered as being past due once the customer has breached an advised limit or been advised of a limit smaller than the current amount outstanding. In assessing whether a borrower is in default, the Bank considers indicators that are Qualitative e.g. breaches of covenant Quantitative e.g. overdue status and non-payment on another obligation of the same issuer to the Bank and Based on data developed internally and obtained from external sources. Inputs into the assessment of whether a financial instrument is in default and their significance may vary over time to reflect changes in circumstances. The definition of default largely aligns with that applied by the Bank for regulatory capital purposes. Incorporation of Forward-looking Information The Bank incorporates forward-looking information into both its assessment of whether the credit risk of an instrument has increased significantly since its initial recognition and its measurement of ECL. Based on advice from the Bank Market Risk Committee and economic experts and consideration of a variety of external actual and forecast information, the Group formulates three economic scenarios a base case, which is the central scenario, base don available projections, and two less likely scenarios, one upside and one downside scenario, Both the upside and downside scenarios are derived from analysis of historical volatilities on each identified macroeconomic variable The Bank applies, in modelling of forward-looking information, Ethiopian historical macroeconomic data and forecasts published by Business Monitor International BMI, a reputable external data body. The scenario probability weightings are derived from each segments macroeconomic information values. Annual Report 202223 57 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 5 Financial Risk Review - Continued a Credit Risk - Continued Incorporation of Forward-looking Information - Continued PD computed for ECL estimation is point-in-time. It captures all macroeconomic factors that will affect PD estimate in the future. Therefore, the impact of forward-looking indicators on PD has to been analyzed using Principal Component Analysis PCA in order to generate FLI adjusted PD. The Cox proportional hazards model's exponent function is used to compute the FLI adjusters as a function of PCA coefficients and macroeconomic projections on a base, upside and downside basis. PCA coefficient values are used as base probability weights and split the difference equally for upside and downside scenarios. The Bank has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for each portfolio of financial instruments and, using an analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between macro-economic variables and credit risk and credit losses. The economic scenarios used as at 30 June 2022 included the following key indicators Real GDP growth rate Gross national expenditure of GDP Real rate of interest lending Gross national savings Gross national Income Exports of goods and services Debt servicing Import of goods and services Real rate of interest time deposit Gross domestic savings, and Official exchange rate. Predicted relationships between the key indicators and default and loss rates on various portfolios of financial assets have been developed based on analysing historical data over the past 10 to 15 years. Measurement of ECL The key inputs into the measurement of ECL are the term structure of the following variables Probability of default PD Loss given default LGD and Exposure at default EAD. These parameters are generally derived from internally developed statistical models and other historical data. They are adjusted to reflect forward-looking information as described above. PD estimates are estimates at a certain date, which are calculated, based on statistical models, and assessed using tools tailored to the various categories of counterparties and exposures. These statistical models are based on internally compiled data comprising both quantitative and qualitative factors. Where it is available, market data may also be used to derive the PD for loans and advances to banks and investment securities. LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Bank estimates LGD parameters based mainly on the counterparties collateral and also on the history of recovery rates of claims Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 58 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 5 Financial Risk Review - Continued a Credit Risk - Continued Measurement of ECL - Continued against defaulted counterparties. The LGD models consider the structure, collateral, seniority of the claim counterparty industry and recovery costs of any collateral that is integral to the financial asset. They are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis using the effective interest rate as the discounting factor. EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Bank derives the EAD from the current exposure to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract including amortisation. The EAD of a financial asset is its gross carrying amount. For lending commitments and financial guarantees, the EAD includes the amount drawn, as well as potential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated based on historical observations and forward-looking forecasts. As described above, and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for financial assets for which credit risk has not significantly increased, the Bank measures ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period including any borrowers extension options over which it is exposed to credit risk, even if, for risk management purposes, the Bank considers a longer period. The maximum contractual period extends to the date at which the Bank has the right to require repayment of an advance or terminate a loan commitment or guarantee. Where modelling of a parameter is carried out on a collective basis, the financial instruments are grouped on the basis of shared risk characteristics that include Instrument type Credit risk gradings Collateral type Date of initial recognition Industry and Geographic location of the borrower. The groupings are subject to regular review to ensure that exposures within a particular group remain appropriately homogeneous. Loss Allowance The following tables show reconciliations from the opening to the closing balance of the loss allowance by class of financial instrument.

Loans with pre-established repayment program are non-performing impaired when principal andor interest is due or uncollected for 90 consecutive days or more. Overdrafts and other advances that do not have pre-established repayment program are non-performing defaulted when The debt remains outstanding for 90 consecutive days or more beyond the scheduled payment date or maturity. The debt exceeds the borrowers approved limit for 90 consecutive days or more. Interest is due and uncollected for 90 consecutive days or more. For overdrafts, - The account has been inactive for 90 consecutive days or more or - Deposits are insufficient to cover the interest capitalized during 90 consecutive days or - The account fails to show debit balance of 5 or less from the approved limit at least once over 360 days preceding the date of loan review. While managing credit risk, default is considered to have occurred with regard to particular obligor when either or both of the following two events have occurred. Loans secured by cash or cash substitute guarantees andor sources of payment that are enough to cover the carrying value are deemed default but not impaired, that means, with no losses incurred. RestructuredRenegotiated Loans Renegotiated loans or advances refers to loans which have been refinanced, rescheduled, rolled over, or otherwise modified at favorable terms and conditions for the borrower because of weaknesses in the borrowers financial condition or ability to repay. Non-performing loans are restructured when the result of analysis on the obligors financial capacity witnesses the need to modifychange the original terms and conditions of the loan contract in order to recover the outstanding loan. As per CBEs problem loans management procedure, any NPL defaulted loan is worked out and restructured by taking either of the following changes or combined options. Extension of the repayment period with the consent of the concerned parties borrower and guarantor Changing the form of the loan fully or partially e.g. overdraft to a term loan Requesting additional collateral or change of collateral Cross-collateralizing multiple loans Including additional covenants Arranging transfer of loans from one borrower to other borrowers upon request by the borrower, based on the mutual agreement of both the borrower and the would-be buyer of the loan, when an acceptable agreement is submitted to the Bank and a new buyer of the loan is deemed to be better than the actual customer Persuading owners, shareholders, and directorsmanagers of borrowers to enter into a personal guarantee contract with the Bank Annual Report 202223 61 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 5 Financial Risk Review - Continued a Credit Risk - Continued The Bank does not encourage additional finance for the loan recovery cases. However, the Bank may approve additional loan for Grade 6 and 7 customers, if there are appropriate and concrete justifiable reasons and An existing loan whose terms have been modified may be derecognized and the renegotiated loan recognized as a new loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy. Once a non- performing loan has been restructured, it doesnt remains in the same category of loan status as prior to the restructuring. However, the status category is turned to substandard, without prejudice to the standard definition of substandard when a Renegotiated term loans equivalent of all past due interest is paid by the borrower in cash at the time of renegotiation and the following payments are made by the borrower on a consistent and timely basis in accordance with the restructured terms of the loan or advance. - Loans with monthly or quarterly installment payments, at least 3three consecutive repayments - Loans with semi-annual installment repayments, at least 2two installments - Loans with annual installment repayments, at least one repayment. b Renegotiated non-performing overdraft facilities equivalent of all past due interest is paid by the borrower in cash at the time of renegotiation and the account shows at a minimum - A nil balance at least once - A turnover rate of once the approved limit. Write-off Policy The Bank determines the write-off of a loan or group of loans demonstrating non-recoverability. This determination is made after performing an analysis of the financial conditions from the date of default and the likelihood of recovering such loans. As per the credit procedure a loan is written-off when the Bank exhausts all means to recover the outstanding loan. It is uncertain to know how long it will take to get court verdict on litigations to recover the outstanding amount of defaulted loans from other attachable properties registered in the name of the defaulters. Hence, doesnt consider time limit for write-offs. Defaulted loans are written- off immediately after exhausting all means to recover the loan. After having fully exhausted all possible means for the recovery of loans and advances and after ascertaining that the property held as collateral does not cover the loan in full and after having ascertained that there is no other attachable property to cover the remaining balance fully or partially, the recovery area shall compile evidence to support that the loan or part of the loan it proposes to write-off is unrecoverable. Loan write-offs can be initiated for the following reasons Absence of attachable property Insolvency of the borrower Declaration of bankruptcy of the borrower by a court Higher cost of recovery than the realizable value of the property Defects in Documentation if the Bank has no legal ground to sue the borrower because of defects in the contract Court decision and Statute limitation. Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 62 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued The following table shows the credit rating of deposits in financial institutions basis of ratings afforded by credit rating agencies The credit rating of these financial institutions, in which CBE has maintained Nostro account balance, is basically obtained from the world bankers almanac as rated by Moody, Fitch, and Standards Poor. The equivalent rating is used to aggregate the overall rating by these agencies. Collateral CBE has guarantee on loans granted, mainly Government bond and written government undertaking by the Ministry of Finance, Motor Vehicles, Buildings and other class of collaterals. Fair value estimates are based on the value of guarantees at the time loans commitments are originated. The Bank has technical employees appraisers for a constant monitoring of these collaterals in order to update such fair values if it is necessary. In addition, the fair value of collateral is updated when a loan is individually assessed as impaired or by any change in conditions that the debtor request in advance and in the case of project financing, according to the progress of work.

Every collateralized property is insured by appropriate insurance company and they have 100 insurance policy coverage against perils related the property. According to credit procedure of CBE, collateralized building and other real properties are revalued every five year. However, a revaluation of collateral may be undertaken at any time if either of the following conditions materializes. If a sudden price decline of the property held as collateral is ascertained or suspected. When a report is received evidencing that the property held as collateral has sustained damages or master plan changes that affects the value of the collateral. When noticeable construction is added to the collateral held. When the Bank decides to foreclose the collateral.

The collateral data indicates the balance of collateral securities held by CBE for loans and advances disbursed up to 30 June, 2023. The Bank analyzes credit risk concentration by sector and geographic location. The analysis of credit risk concentration as of the reporting date of the financial statement is described as follows i. Concentration by Sector Sector 30 June 2023 30 June 2022 Agriculture 29,694,884,239 45,355,438,366 Manufacturing 205,924,733,608 191,384,029,915 Domestic trade and services 47,590,707,935 18,144,383,818 International trade 12,295,358,584 13,008,313,641 Building and construction 16,432,762,887 26,221,507,793 Consumer loan 53,104,227,219 32,006,414,780 Financial institutions 1,162,157,785 321,450,738 Total outstanding 366,204,832,256 326,441,539,051 Allowance for expected credit loss 35,768,614,776 32,788,647,408 Net loan 330,436,217,480 293,652,891,643 The loan portfolio is diversified in all economic sectors.

Loan Commitment by Product Line Financial guarantees are contracts that require the CBE to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss that it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when it is due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Term loan and bond commitments are promises to disburse the remaining portion of an approved loanbond under pre-specified terms and conditions. Letter of credit commitment is also pertaining to advances made to import and export business of the borrowers where the Bank is committed to meet their obligation when they fail. b Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group either does not have sufficient resources available to meet all its obligations and commitments as and when they fall due, or can only access these financial resources at excessive cost. The Groups approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation and security. The Group manages liquidity risk both a short-term and medium-term basis. In short-term, the focus is on ensuring that the cash flow demands can be met through asset maturities, customer deposits and wholesale funding where required. In the medium-term, the focus is on ensuring the statement of financial position remains structurally sound. The Asset and Liability Management Committee ALCO and the Risk Management Committee regularly monitor the liquidity position by analyzing the maturity structure of assets and liabilities, the stability of deposits by customer type and the compliance to minimum standards set forth by the regulations and corporate policies. The key measure used by the Group for managing liquidity risk is the ratio of net liquid assets to deposits from customers. Net liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and negotiable financial instruments that mature in less than 186 days from the date of issue. 30 June 2023 30 June 2022 Concentration by commitment type Loan and bond commitment 38,449,036,150 32,256,425,592 Letter of credit 210,932,254,909 222,683,990,950 Letter of guarantee 6,309,493,394 15,769,954,194 Total 255,690,784,453 270,710,370,735 Provision for loan loss 150,871,794 160,681,635 Total commitment, net 255,539,912,659 270,549,689,100 Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 66 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 30 June 2023 30 June 2022 Loans and advances to customers 330,436,217,481 293,652,891,643 Deposits from customers 1,054,491,375,058 890,942,145,511 Loans and advances to deposits ratio 31.34 32.96 5 FINANCIAL RISK REVIEW - Continued b Liquidity Risk - Continued The Group also monitors on a regular basis the advances to deposits ratio. This is defined as the ratio of total loans and advances to customers relative to total customer deposits. A low advance to deposit ratio demonstrates that customer deposits are in excess of customer loans due to the emphasis placed on generating a high level of stable funding from customers.

Customer deposits up to three months represent current, savings and call deposit account balances, which past experience has shown to be stable and of a long-term nature. Liquidity risk arises in the general funding of the Groups activities and in the management of positions. It includes both the risk of being unable to fund assets at appropriate maturities and rates, and the risk of being unable to liquidate an asset at a reasonable price and in an appropriate time frame. The Group has access to a diverse funding base. Funds are raised using a broad range of instruments including deposits and other liabilities. This enhances flexibility, limits dependence on any source of funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. The Group strives to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of liabilities with a range of maturities. The Group continually assesses liquidity risk by identifying and monitoring changes in funding required meeting business goals and targets set in terms of the overall Group strategy. c Market Risk The Group recognizes market risk as the risk of loss arising from changes in market prices and rates. The Groups exposure to market risk arises principally from customer-driven transactions and recognizes that the value of on and off-balance sheet positions of the Group are adversely affected by the movement in the market prices or rates such as interest rate, exchange rate, equity prices and commodity price that may result in loss for the Group. The objective of the Groups market risk policies and processes is to obtain the best balance between risk and return whilst meeting customers requirements. The Groups exposure to potential market risk arises mainly due to the open interest rate and exchange rate positions. All these elements are exposed to general and specific market movements and may result in the reduction of the value of a financial asset. The Asset and Liability Management Committee ALCO authorize the established limits and monitor results. a Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk is the exposure of the financial position of the Group to any losses arising from adverse movements in interest rates. The Group monitors the sensitivity of changes in interest rates, and determines the balance structure, different item terms and investment strategies. The table below summarizes the exposure to interest rate risks. Included in the table below are the Groups assets and liabilities at carrying amounts, categorized by the earlier of contractual re-pricing or maturity dates.

The Group seeks to ensure that key operational risks are managed in a timely and effective manner through a framework of policies, procedures and tools to identify, assess, monitor, control and report such risks. Operational risks arise from all of the Groups operations and are faced by all business units. As such, the Group seeks to ensure that key operational risks are managed in a timely and effective manner through a framework of policies, procedures and tools to identify, assess, control and report such risks. The scope of operational risk assessment of any process shall be determined based on various factors among them The level of perceived risks Previous operational risk assessment risks Business criticality of the activities, process or product under consideration The presence of overarching regulatory requirement and Managements need for further examination of ongoing operations such as lines of business, product, service and processes individually or in combinations. Every risk assessment unit shall perform a risk assessment on its respective processesunits, at least on an annual basis. The Risk and Compliance Management process may request for more frequent risk assessment, if the need arises, primarily based on the perceived level of risk of the respective risk assessment unitprocess. e Capital Management The Group manages its capital based on Basel guidelines as well as local regulation requirements. The Commercial Code of Ethiopia through article 80 capital and reserves defines capital as the original value of the elements put at disposal of the undertaking by the owner or partners by way of contribution in kind or in cash. It further stipulates that all profits preserved for the undertaking and not forming part of capital shall constitute a reserve. The statutory regulator, the National Bank of Ethiopia, has issued directive number SBB495 that dictates every bank transfer on an annual basis, 25 of its annual net profit to its legal reserve account until such account equals its capital. When the legal reserve account equals the Banks capital, the amount to be transferred to the legal reserve account shall be 10 of the annual net profit. The Banks capital is therefore managed in accordance with NBE directives and proclamation on banking business and those of subsidiaries capital is managed in accordance with the commercial code and other related laws. Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 76 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 5 FINANCIAL RISK REVIEW - CONTINUED e Capital Management Continued In addition to regulatory requirements, CBE conducts objective analysis on the adequacy of its capitalization on a regular basis. Based on the result of rigorous analysis made on capital management and adequacy, CBE injects additional capital after proposing the required amountof additional capital to the Ministry of Finance and upon approval by the house of peoples representatives of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. The National Bank of Ethiopia requires a bank to maintain at all times Primary or Tier 1 capital state capitalpaid-up capital, declared reserves and Accumulated Profit or loss.

The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk. When applicable, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. When there is no quoted price in an active market, the Group uses valuation techniques that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. The following sets out the Groups basis of establishing fair values of financial instruments Investment securities with observable market prices including equity securities are fair valued using that information. Investment securities that do not have observable market data are fair valued using discounted cash flow method or quoted market prices for securities with similar yield characteristics. During the current year, there was sufficient information available to measure the fair value of financial instruments based on observable market inputs. In the previous year, the available-for-sale equity instruments were measured at cost because the fair value was not considered to be reliably measurable. Loans and advances to customers and Loans to micro-finance institutions are net of allowance for impairment. The estimated fair value of loans and advances represents the discounted amount of future cash flows expected to be received. Expected cash flows are discounted at current market rates to determine fair value hence their fair values approximate their carrying amounts. The estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is the amount repayable on demand. Estimated fair value if fixed interest-bearing deposits without quoted market prices is based on discounting cash flows using the prevailing market rates for debts with similar maturities and interest rates, hence their fair value approximates their carrying amounts.

This note presents information about the Banks exposure to each of the above risks, and the Banks objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risks. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout separate financial statement. Risk Management Framework The Board of Directors of the Bank has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Banks risk management framework. The Board has established the Loan and Risk Review Committee LRRC through the Loan and Risk Review Committee charter, which is responsible for providing the standards and minimum parameters to be followed in managing the banks exposure to risk. Besides, it is also responsible for developing and monitoring effectiveness of the Banks risk management policies and the degree of compliance to national and international regulatory standards. The LLRC reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities. The Banks risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Bank, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to those limits. The risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Banks activities. The Bank through its training management standards and procedures aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all the employees understand their roles and obligations.

The Banks Board Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit function. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Banks Audit Committee. In addition, the Bank is subject to the regulations of the National Bank of Ethiopia with respect to, among others matters, comprehensive risk management, liquidity and capitalization. a Credit Risk Refer page number 51-68 b Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that theBank either does not have sufficient resources available to meet all its obligations and commitments as and when they fall due, or can only access these financial resources at excessive cost. The Banks approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Banks reputation and security. The Bank manages liquidity risk both a short-term and medium-term basis. In short-term, the focus is on ensuring that the cash flow demands can be met through asset maturities, customer deposits and wholesale funding where required. In the medium-term, the focus is on ensuring the statement of financial position remains structurally sound. The Asset and Liability Management Committee ALCO and the Risk Management Committee regularly monitor the liquidity position by analyzing the maturity structure of assets and liabilities, the stability of deposits by customer type and the compliance to minimum standards set forth by the regulations and corporate policies. The key measure used by the Bank for managing liquidity risk is the ratio of net liquid assets to deposits from customers. Net liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and negotiable financial instruments that mature in less than 186 days from the date of issue. The Bank also monitors on a regular basis the advances to deposits ratio. This is defined as the ratio of total loans and advances to customers relative to total customer deposits. A low advance to deposit ratio demonstrates that customer deposits are in excess of customer loans due to the emphasis placed on generating a high level of stable funding from customers.

Customer deposits up to three months represent current, savings and call deposit account balances, which past experience has shown to be stable and of a long-term nature. Liquidity risk arises in the general funding of the Banks activities and in the management of positions. It includes both the risk of being unable to fund assets at appropriate maturities and rates, and the risk of being unable to liquidate an asset at a reasonable price and in an appropriate time frame. The Bank has access to a diverse funding base. Funds are raised using a broad range of instruments including deposits and other liabilities. This enhances flexibility, limits dependence on any source of funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. The Bank strives to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of liabilities with a range of maturities. The Bank continually assesses liquidity risk by identifying and monitoring changes in funding required meeting business goals and targets set in terms of the overall Bank strategy. c Market Risk The Bank recognizes market risk as the risk of loss arising from changes in market prices and rates. The Banks exposure to market risk arises principally from customer-driven transactions and recognizes that the value of on and off-balance sheet positions of the bank are adversely affected by the movement in the market prices or rates such as interest rate, exchange rate, equity prices and commodity price that may result in loss for the bank. The objective of the Banks market risk policies and processes is to obtain the best balance between risk and return whilst meeting customers requirements. The Banks exposure to potential market risk arises mainly due to the open interest rate and exchange rate positions. All these elements are exposed to general and specific market movements and may result in the reduction of the value of a financial asset. The Asset and Liability Management Committee ALCO authorize the established limits and monitor results. a Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk is the exposure of the financial position of the Bank to any losses arising from adverse movements in interest rates. The Bank monitors the sensitivity of changes in interest rates, and determines the balance structure, different item terms and investment strategies. The table below summarizes the exposure to interest rate risks. Included in the table below are the Banks assets and liabilities at carrying amounts, categorized by the earlier of contractual re-pricing or maturity dates.

The Bank seeks to ensure that key operational risks are managed in a timely and effective manner through a framework of policies, procedures and tools to identify, assess, monitor, control and report such risks. Operational risks arise from all of the Banks operations and are faced by all business units. As such, the Bank seeks to ensure that key operational risks are managed in a timely and effective manner through a framework of policies, procedures and tools to identify, assess, control and report such risks. The scope of operational risk assessment of any process shall be determined based on various factors among them The level of perceived risks Previous operational risk assessment risks Business criticality of the activities, process or product under consideration The presence of overarching regulatory requirement and Managements need for further examination of ongoing operations such as lines of business, product, service and processes individually or in combinations. Every risk assessment unit shall perform a risk assessment on its respective processesunits, at least on an annual basis. The Risk and Compliance Management process may request for more frequent risk assessment, if the need arises, primarily based on the perceived level of risk of the respective risk assessment unitprocess. e Capital Management The National Bank of Ethiopia, has issued directive number SBB495 that dictates every bank transfer on an annual basis, 25 of its annual net profit to its legal reserve account until such account equals its capital. When the legal reserve account equals the Banks capital, the amount to be transferred to the legal reserve account shall be 10 of the annual net profit. The Banks capital is therefore managed in accordance with NBE directives and proclamation on banking business and those of subsidiaries capital is managed in accordance with the commercial code and other related laws. In addition to regulatory requirements, CBE conducts objective analysis on the adequacy of its capitalization on a regular basis. Based on the result of rigorous analysis made on capital management and adequacy, CBE injects additional capital after proposing the required amountof additional capital to the Ministry of Finance and upon approval by the house of peoples representatives of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. The National Bank of Ethiopia requires a bank to maintain at all times Primary or Tier 1 capital state capitalpaid-up capital, declared reserves and Accumulated Profit or loss. Secondary or Tier 2 capital Includes qualified equity instruments. However, CBE does not have any tier-2 capital account in its statement of financial position.

The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk. When applicable, the Bank measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. When there is no quoted price in an active market, the Bank uses valuation techniques that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. Annual Report 202223 117 COMMERCIAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 30 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - Continued a Accounting Classifications - Continued The following sets out the Banks basis of establishing fair values of financial instruments Investment securities with observable market prices including equity securities are fair valued using that information. Investment securities that do not have observable market data are fair valued using discounted cash flow method or quoted market prices for securities with similar yield characteristics. During the current year, there was sufficient information available to measure the fair value of financial instruments based on observable market inputs. In the previous year, the available-for-sale equity instruments were measured at cost because the fair value was not considered to be reliably measurable. Loans and advances to customers and Loans to micro-finance institutions are net of allowance for impairment. The estimated fair value of loans and advances represents the discounted amount of future cash flows expected to be received. Expected cash flows are discounted at current market rates to determine fair value hence their fair values approximate their carrying amounts. The estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is the amount repayable on demand. Estimated fair value if fixed interest-bearing deposits without quoted market prices is based on discounting cash flows using the prevailing market rates for debts with similar maturities and interest rates, hence their fair value approximates their carrying amounts.
