Dr. Yoseph Yonas Million Duguma Director Director Director Director Director AWASH BANK 3 ANNUAL REPORT 202324 Dear Esteemed Shareholders, Ladies and Gentlemen! On behalf of the Board of Directors and on my own behalf, I am deeply honored and excited to warmly welcome you all to the 29th Awash Banks Shareholders Annual General Meeting AGM of the FY 202324. I want to express my sincere statement of praise to all of you for your unwavering loyalty and commitment to Awash Bank, and your endless support has been instrumental for the Banks sterling performance since its inception. The financial year 202324 was challenging in many aspects with significant global and domestic economic developments and fallbacks BOARD CHAIRMANS MESSAGE Gure Kumssa Board Chairman that impacted the Banks business in several ways. In the overview of the global economy, the growth remarkably remained resilient with steady progress. According to the IMFs recent projections of April 2024, the World economic growth in the year 2023 held steady at 3.2 and projected to continue at the same pace in 2024 and 2025. The pace of the global economic expansion is below the historical growth, which is 3.8, in between the years 2000- 2019. The reasons for the decline in growth of the global economy can be, among others, the longer-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, weak growth in productivity and increasing geo- economic fragmentation. In the domestic macro-economic overview, the Ethiopian economy has faced several challenges, of which from the external, Russia and Ukraine war and conflicts in the Middle East are some to be mentioned. From the internal challenges, internal instability, high inflation and shortage of foreign exchange and heavy debt burden are some of the major challenges worth mentioning. In spite of the global and domestic challenging environments in the banking industry during FY 202324, the Board and the Management of the Bank responded to the environment by adapting different strategies to leverage available opportunities while creating value for its Shareholders and Stakeholders. The Board comprising of 12 Directors, is also dedicated to ensuring effective corporate governance and sound risk management practices which are of fundamental importance in the banking industry. Adherence to good AWASH BANK 4 ANNUAL REPORT 202324 corporate governance principles continues to be the basis of the Banks activities thereby helping the Board to fulfill its supervisory role. By doing so, the Board confirmed that it can build a stronger and safer Bank that is capable of delivering higher revenues to its shareholders. Over the past twelve years, the Bank has registered magnificent results that proved and increased income and earnings per share, with a track record of creating a momentous value for its shareholders. During the year, the Board conducted 14 meetings of which 2 were special meetings and 12 were regular meetings and passed 36 decisions to the Management for implementation. In addition, the Board has approved 21 policies for the benefit of the Bank and to fulfill the requirement of the National Bank of Ethiopia. In order to closely supervise the activities of the Bank as per the Corporate Governance Directives, the Board has established six Board Sub-Committees. These Sub- Committees all together conducted 72 meetings during the year and critically assessed and made close oversights of the different activities of the Bank and reported quarterly to the Board of Directors. With regard to key financial and non- financial activities of the Bank as at end of June 30, 2024, the following major performances can be cited The aggregate deposit increased by Birr 45.1 billion or 24 percent from last year same period and reached Birr 232.4 billion including LC margin and deposit from IFB, Loans and Advances surged up by Birr 21.6 billion or 13.3 percent over last year same period and reached Birr 183.5 billion, Total income of the Bank escalated by Birr 7.77 billion or 27 percent from last year same period and stood at Birr 36.58 billion, AWASH BANK 4 ANNUAL REPORT Total expense of the Bank stood at Birr 25.77 billion as at June 30, 2024, up by Birr 6.72 billion or 35 percent from previous year similar period, The gross profit before tax grew by Birr 1.06 billion or 11 percent over the previous year same period and reached Birr 10.8 billion as at end of June 30, 2024. Profit after tax was Birr 8.7 billion, increasing by Birr 1.7 billion or 24 as compared to last year same period. Total Foreign Currency generated during the year stood at USD 1.52 billion surpassing the amount generated last year same period by USD 26.84 million. The Banks total asset position was Birr 282 billion by the end of June 30, 2024 depicting a growth of Birr 58 billion or 26 percent increment compared to last year same period. The aggregate deposit customer base rose to 12.41 million, up by 19 percent from last year similar period. The account growth trend extends to both conventional and IFB accounts with conventional showing a growth of 1,509,062 and IFB accounting for 480,301. The branch network as at June 30, 2024 reached 947, including the opening up of 72 new branches during the FY 202324. As seen above, the growth registered by the Bank in the major banking operations marked a historic year among the private banks and also in Awash Bank itself, reflecting how much the business of the Bank is strengthened. The diligent credit screening process and continuous follow- up and collection of repayments of loans advances resulted in good asset quality as measured by non-performing loans. Accordingly, Non-Performing Loans NPLs of the Bank stood at 1.25 percent as at June 30, 2024. AWASH BANK 5 ANNUAL REPORT 202324 The overall success of the Bank is the result of close follow-up and directions given by the Board of Directors, the prudent and coordinated quality leadership of the CEO, the dedication and commitment of the Management Members, the immense and unreserved contribution of the entire employees and the overall strong endeavors made by the Bank-wide community to maximize the wallet share of the Bank that deserves an honorary recognition. As a reflection of the Banks best performance, Awash Bank has received various awards and accolades during the financial year ended June 30, 2024. To mention some 1. Global Banking Finance Award 2024, as one of the Best African Banks 2. International Bankers Award 2024, as Best Commercial Bank of the year from Ethiopia. 3. Awash Bank won EUROMONEY Award for Excellence 2024,as Ethiopias Best Digital Bank. At this historic step, it should be noted that the Board is always committed to ensuring that Awash Bank is a robust organization with a focus on long-term value creation for its shareholders. In this regard, the concrete and swift actions taken by the Board in consultation with the Management during the year for fundamental changes ensuring sustainable profitable growth through excellence in operation, technology ultimately customer satisfaction have all contributed to the success of the Bank. On the other hand, during the year under review, the Bank was engaged on various strategic initiatives, such as developing international and instant card issuance, launching of simple and differentiated digital products, branding of agents, engaging partnership agreements with fintech and other digital service providers, developing medium and long-term IT investments roadmap, automating cyber- attack prevention, re-segmentation of Wholesale as well as Retail SME Banking customers. In the Corporate Strategy Development Project, the Bank has also undertaken the implementation and follow up of the initiatives set in the Vision 2030Project, though revision of the strategy is necessary due to changes made in the macro-economic reform of the country. As part of strengthening its asset base, the Bank has pursued the acquisition and construction of building projects at different strategic locations. Some of the activities are a. The purchase of three branch office buildings and purchase of one building b. The completion of the title deed receiving process of the future HQ building site 10,500m2 and the opening of Project Management Office PMO on the site c. The ongoing construction of BG7 building in Ambo town d. Completion of the design approval and construction permit of Weliso G4, Burayu G4, Bonga G7 and Ashewa Meda compound building G1 e. The near to completion of the construction of Asella building G4, Yebu building G2 and the commencement of the construction work of Dire Dawa Building BG7. With regard to the Human Resource Policies and Practices, the Bank focuses on attracting, motivating and retaining qualified and skilled manpower. It is the Board of Directors believe that having a motivated workforce a sound governance risk management are crucial to attaining a sustainable growth that the Bank aspires for. In connection with this, steps were taken to improve staff productivity, focusing on optimizing the AWASH BANK 6 ANNUAL REPORT 202324 existing resource through internal job postings, transfers and skill enhancement initiatives. Following the recruitment of 1,022 employees during the FY 202324, the total staff strength of the Bank stood at 20,633 as at June 30, 2024. Concerning the capital structure, the strategic growth aspiration of the Bank, which is to become One of the Top Ten African Banks by the Year 2030, has to be backed by a solid capital base. On top of that, the capital adequacy ratio of the Bank should also be comfortably above the regulatory requirement and should provide strong foundation for the company. It is also worth mentioning that the growth of the Bank itself involves capital growth for its stability and resilience in the financial market. To this end, the paid up capital of the Bank as at June 30, 2024, has reached Birr 20.31 billion, putting the Bank at the Top of the Private Banks operating in Ethiopia. On the way forward, I want to stress that the Board and the Management are bold enough to work hard during the FY 202425, on several initiatives and strategies of the Bank aimed at preparing itself for accelerated growth with a focus on achieving the vision 2030 of the Bank by adjusting the strategy in accordance with the objective reality of the country. The Board is also striving to take advantage of the resilient macro- economic fundamentals to drive the business growth and take the Bank a step forward, despite fierce competition amongst Banks, the persistence rise in cost of doing business and instability in some areas of the country. Given the dedication of the Board, the Management Team, and the competency of the entire employees, the Bank continues to connect and serve its customers seamlessly, in the areas of customer service, stakeholder value, sustainable earnings and corporate governance. In conclusion, on behalf of the Board of Directors, let me take this opportunity to express my deep sense of gratitude to all shareholders, loyal customers and the public at large for their firm and indispensable support and the confidence they have on our Bank. I solicit a continued support from our valued stakeholders a renewed commitment to work with the Bank in our journey forward to hit our goals. My special thanks go to the Management Members and the entire employees of the Bank for their passion and commitment, belongingness and hard work to their Bank in delivering commendable results and enabling the Bank to maintain its continuous leading position among the private commercial banks in the country. I would also like to commend the National Bank of Ethiopia NBE for rendering our Bank a constructive guidance and unequivocal support. Finally, recalling that the Bank has come a long way so far, and has still a long way to go, I want to assure you that your Bank has put appropriate plan, policies and strategies to achieve growth with quality, stability and profitability in the years to come. To this end, Awash Bank will strongly scrutinize the laid down Vision 2030 strategy and to bring about further excellence by exploiting opportunities and vigilantly withstanding the challenging environment. Your support, encouragement and faith have instilled in us the confidence required to pursue excellence in the upcoming long journey of the Bank. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your time and attention!

As we close another remarkable year, I would like to take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt congratulations to each of you. Your unwavering dedication and commitment have led our Bank to achieve impressive performance. It is CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS STATEMENT Tsehay Shiferaw Chief Executive Officer through your collective efforts that we were able to register such commendable results for the year just ended. I want to recognize and celebrate the hard work put forth by every member of our Bank. Your resilience and tenacity in navigating the challenges we faced have not gone unnoticed. Together, we have built a solid foundation for our Banks success, and I am very optimistic about what lies ahead. I look forward to your continued support as we strive for even greater achievements in the coming years. While we celebrate our successes on the AWASH BANK 17 ANNUAL REPORT 202324 eve of the 30th Anniversary of the formation of our Bank as well as its sister company, Awash Insurance s.c., we also acknowledge the challenges that persist in our global and local environments. The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine continues to create uncertainty in international markets, impacting supply chains and business operations. Additionally, the conflict in the Middle East has further disrupted business activities, presenting us with obstacles that require our attention and strategic response. On the domestic front, we were not without our own challenges. The conflict in some regions of the country has created instability, while the inflation rate, although showing a decreasing trend, remains high, affecting both consumers and businesses alike. Apart from the above, the following were some of the most visible hurdles that we were exposed to during the financial year. 1. As per the Federal Governments official report, the export performance of the country for the year ended 202324 2016 E.C. was USD 3.8 Billion while the plan was USD 4.85 Billion, which is a decline by USD 1.05 Billion 78.3 plan achievement. The drop in export earnings nation-wide will have a negative impact to adequately address the rising demands of customers engaged in import business. 2. Several monetary tools have been put in place by the Government to reduce the rising inflation. Reducing the amount of money in circulation within the economy was one of the main macro-economic tools used to stabilize the market. However, the currency outside banks, often referred to as money with the public, was alarmingly high and it was one of the major causes of liquidity crunch among local banks. 3. A credit cap was imposed on all banks by the National Bank of Ethiopia as of August 2023. On the basis of the NBEs instruction, the annual credit ceiling was set to a certain limit, which banks cannot exceed beyond their respective limits. As a result, the interest income that will be generated from provision of loans and advances has been seriously affected. 4. Cyber Security Institution has identified our country as one of high risk countries to cyber-attacks. A trillion dollars damage has occurred world-wide and a number of cyber-attack attempts have been observed in our country. In addition to the above, local banks were exposed to various fraudulent activities. These and others were the impediments observed during the year. The impact of the above and other factors on our business was substantial. However, our Bank has been and is still putting in place different strategies to withstand the circumstances and be able to sustain our businesses. The above being the impediments, however, the following were the success stories of our Bank for the year just ended. 1. As a result of a remarkable growth of our Bank in areas of deposits, loans and advances, assets, profit, capital, branch network and others, the Global Finance Magazine has chosen our Bank for the third time in a row as the Best Bank of Ethiopia for the Year 2024. This will definitely enhance the reputation of our Bank world-wide. 2. In November 2023, our Bank received the IRBA Excellence Award for Islamic Retail Banking in Bahrain. The award was decided on the basis of a global ranking of Islamic banks, conducted by Cambridge Institute of Islamic Finance. Representatives of the Bank officially received the award in the program held in Bahrain. AWASH BANK 18 ANNUAL REPORT 202324 3. The regular Customers Week under the motto, We Strive to Delight Our Customers was launched at the beginning of March 2024. The program was colorfully celebrated for the whole month of March 2024 in all branches and Head-Office organs. Similarly, Digital Campaign Month under the Motto, We Strive to Delight Our Customers with Digital Banking aiming at enhancing the Banks digital channel performance across all branches was celebrated in the month of March. The celebration of the programs has enabled us to renew our commitment to serving our customers with greater vigor and enthusiasm. 4. The Digital Lending Product dubbed, Awash Lehulum was colorfully launched in December 2023. It is now on air to all interested users of the product. 5. Our Bank has joined forces with the US- based technology giant MasterCard to unveil a virtual pre-paid international card. Named Awash Pre-Paid Cards, this digital offering responds to the growing demand for flexible payment solutions. The cards enable customers and merchants to make and receive online payments globally. 6. Our Bank has become a shareholder of the Ethiopian Security Exchange by investing Birr 70 Million. The signing ceremony between our Bank and the Ethiopian Security Exchange was held in February 2024. The performance of our Bank for the year ended June 30, 2024 was remarkably commendable. Gross profit before provisions and tax stood at Birr 10.81 Billion from Birr 9.75 Billion of last year same period i.e. Birr 1.06 Billion or 11 growth. This is the highest profit which has never been registered in the history of our Bank as well as in the history of private banks. The paid-up capital has now reached Birr 20.31 Billion from Birr 14.65 Billion of last year same period. In spite of the fact that the profit registered for the year just ended was high, the pace of the paid-up capital increment that is, an increment of Birr 5.66 Billion or 39 in a single year, was even higher and as a result, earnings per share EPS has slightly declined from 577 in 202223 to 487 in 202324 for a par value of Birr 1,000 which, I believe, is still very attractive to the shareholders. As a result of the overall growth and enhanced operation of the Bank as well as inflationary situation of the economy, total expense of the Bank, including interest expense, has surged from Birr 19.05 Billion in 202223 to Birr 25.76 Billion in 202324 that is, a growth of Birr 6.71 Billion or 35. From the total expense items, personnel expense, interest expense, and other operating expenses, in their order, took the highest share like the preceding years. Over the past few years, personnel expenses have emerged as the largest component of our total expenses. This significant financial burden has prompted a comprehensive review of our manpower utilization across all levels including the Head-Office, Regional Offices and branches. The primary objective of this assessment was to evaluate the productivity of each employee within hisher respective work units. Following the manpower assessment, recommendations were made to address performance discrepancies. Strong administrative measures were implemented for under-performing employees, with decisions based solely on their suitability for their assigned roles. This approach prioritizes merit and productivity, ensuring that all personnel align with the Banks operational goals. AWASH BANK 19 ANNUAL REPORT 202324 Looking ahead, we are committed to continuing the manpower productivity assessment of the Bank as part of the strategy to increasing staff productivity and balancing personnel expenses with each staff members contributions to profitability. This ongoing evaluation will enable us to make informed decision regarding staffing and resource allocation. As a result of these initiatives, we anticipate that personnel expense will be more effectively managed in the coming years. By focusing on performance and accountability, we aim at enhancing overall efficiency and ensuring that our workforce is optimally positioned to support the Banks growth objectives. Total deposit that is, conventional and interest free banking, as at June 30, 202324 stood at Birr 232.4 Billion and that was the highest deposit balance ever registered in our Bank as well as in the history of private banks. The deposit balance significantly grew by Birr 45.1 Billion or 24 in 202324 as compared to 202223. Similarly, total asset remarkably grew from Birr 224.02 Billion in 202223 to Birr 282.41 Billion in 202324 i.e., a growth of Birr 58.39 Billion or 26.06, and this was also the highest figure by many standards. Loans and advances took the lions share of the total asset accounting for Birr 183.52 Billion or 65 of the asset components. The NPLs ratio as at June 30, 202324 stood at 1.25 and this was much lower than the threshold i.e. 5, set by the National Bank of Ethiopia. The NPLs ratio in comparison with the total loan portfolio was not as such a concerning issue but still all possible effort will be exerted by all concerned to keep it at the lowest possible limit so as to maintain the asset quality of the Bank. Our Bank has opened 72 branches in the fiscal year and the total number of branches, both in city and outlying areas, as at end of June 202324 reached 947. Despite many internal and external challenges, the financial year 202324 was very blossoming in many respects to the banking industry in general and to our Bank in particular. Going forward, the year 202425 and ahead are expected to be very challenging. To ameliorate the situation, some amendment was made on the organizational structure of the Bank and accordingly, a new office, named Chief Financial Officer CFO was established to oversee capital market and open market operations. Also, the position of Area Managers has been created under Regional Directors to oversee a cluster of branches. The creation of this office will help to closely monitor and follow- up the operations of branches under their respective cluster. Branch and staff productivity will be the concerning issues in the times to come. Particularly, the productivity of branches shall be a matter of survival and, thus, closing of unproductive branches shall continue in consideration of the market dynamics, cost issues, technological trends, regulatory factors and strategic objectives. Country-level double-digit inflation rate for food and non-food items is also expected to escalate the expenses of the Bank. In this regard, the existing cost minimization strategies shall be revised and put in place to tackle the problem. I am, however, very enthusiastic that things will improve in due course of time and Awash will keep on flourishing to satisfy the interests of all its stakeholders. I believe that with our renewed commitment and concerted effort, we can succeed in our business objectives in the challenging times to come. AWASH BANK 20 ANNUAL REPORT 202324 Taking this opportunity, I would like to once again extend my heart-felt appreciation to our esteemed customers for their loyalty, and dedicated Management and hardworking staff members for the remarkable performance registered in 202324. Finally, I would like to extend my gratitude to all Shareholders, Board of Directors, our Correspondent Banks, Federal and Regional Government Offices and especially the National Bank of Ethiopia and Financial Intelligence Center for their unreserved support, advice and guidance provided to us in our day-to-day activities. God bless you all and our country!

In this regard, Awash Bank continued to maintain its leading position in terms of total deposits, loans and advances, asset size, profitability, branch network and capital base among the 31 private commercial banks operating in Ethiopia. Global challenges include the sustained Russia- Ukraine war disrupting international supply chains, monetary tightening measures and the conflict and crisis that ensued in the Middle East impacting human lives and smooth flow of goods and services. The major domestic headwinds emanate from the regulatory measure that limit the annual growth rate of loans and advances to 14 against the trend annual growth rate of over 25 and the Banks annual growth plan of 35 for the FY 202324. The spillover effects of the Russia-Ukraine war that aggravated domestic inflationary pressures, shortage of foreign currency and the intensified conflict in some parts of the country have also adversely affected the performances of Awash Bank. In a nutshell, during the financial year 202324, Awash Bank has managed to consolidate its leading position among private banks operating in Ethiopia, notwithstanding the highly competitive environment from incumbent and newly entrant domestic banks and non-bank financial service providers as well as stringent monetary policy currently in place. 1. OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCES During the last three decades of its operation, Awash Bank has significantly contributed to the economic growth of the country through enhancing deposit mobilizations, credit provisions, facilitation of trade services and payments, among others. It has also registered superior operational and financial performances that enabled the Bank to double its asset size, including deposit mobilizations and loans and advances every four years, particularly in the last fifteen years. Now, the modus operandi of banking operations seem to be changed in the Ethiopian landscape due to digitalization, change in the customer expectations, proliferation of non-bank financial service operators encompassing telecom operators and fintech companies, stringent banking regulations and change in the monetary and exchange rate regimes. 1.1 Deposits Mobilization The Banks total deposits including LC margin and deposit from interest free banking increased from Birr 187.4 billion at the end of June 2023 to Birr 232.4 billion at the end of June 2024, marking a substantial increase of Birr 45.1 billion 24 percent from the preceding year. The Banks commendable and sustainable deposit growth was anchored to a number of factors, including widening of customer base, expansion of service delivery channels such as number of branches and online services and offering of diversified range of financial products and services. The Banks deposits growth was broad-based, with increases across all deposit categories. Awash Banks interest-free banking segment remains crucial to deposit mobilization and overall growth of the Bank, underscoring the Banks dedications to offering Sharia- compliant financial services. Accordingly, the IFB deposit grew by Birr 3.3 billion 21.3 during the financial year 202324 and reached Birr 19 billion at the end of June 30, 2024.

AWASH BANK 40 ANNUAL REPORT 202324 In our opinion, generally, we, the Shariah Advisory Committee of Awash Bank, do hereby confirm that The IFB Products mentioned above, Operational procedures, contracts, transactions and dealings entered into by the Bank during the year ended 30 June 2024 that we have reviewed are in compliance with the Shariah principles and the Shariah rulings related to IFB operations. Mudarabah deposits and financing Profit-Loss Sharing is not yet started and thus, there is no allocation of profit and charging of losses relating to investment accounts. The profits generated by the Bank, from Murabaha and other services like Kafalah, are Shariah- compliant products and there are no earnings that have been realized from sources prohibited by the Shariah principles and thus, no fund is expected to be disposed to charitable causes from the Bank's profit. However, ETB 56,406,371.31 was collected from defaulted customers in the form of penalty which must be given to Charity. To ensure the objective utilization of the Charity Account, the SAC has adopted comprehensive guidelines. These guidelines outline the criteria for selecting eligible beneficiaries, the types of projects that qualify for funding, and the evaluation process for assessing the impact and feasibility of proposed initiatives. By adhering to these guidelines, Awash Bank Ikhlas ensures that funds are utilized effectively and in line with Shariah Principles. We recommend that the Bank continue to engage with the Shariah Advisory Committee on a regular basis to ensure that its IFB products and services remain Shariah-compliant. Shukran!

The financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2024 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards "IFRS" as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board "IASB". Additional information required by National regulations is included where appropriate. The financial statements comprise the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the statement of financial position, the statement of changes in equity, the statement of cash flows and the notes to the financial statements. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern principle under the historical cost concept, except for the following defined benefit pension plans plan assets measured at fair value. Equity investments which is measured at fair value. All values are rounded to the nearest thousand, except when otherwise indicated. The financial statements are presented in thousands of Ethiopian Birr ETB' 000. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Banks accounting policies. Changes in assumptions may have a significant impact on the financial statements in the period the assumptions changed. Management believes that the underlying assumptions are appropriate and that the Bank's financial statements, therefore, present the financial position and results fairly. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in Note 3. The Bank's vision is to be the best and preferred financial service provider where customers feel vauled. The Bank's mission is to provide the most innovative and accessible banking service to its customers usinig the most relevant technology, motivated and talented staff to maximize shareholders' value and influence the life of the society positively. 14 Awash Bank S.C.

IFRS 17 - Insurance contracts The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The management have no doubt that the Bank would remain inexistence after 12 months. Summary of material accounting policies continued Basis of preparation Continued The unearned profit contractual service margin is recognised over the coverage period. Aside from this general model, the standard provides, as a simplification, the premium allocation approach. This simplified approach is applicable for certain types of contracts, including those with a coverage period of one year or less. For insurance contracts with direct participation features, the variable fee approach applies. The variable fee approach is a variation on the general model. When applying the variable fee approach, the entitys share of the fair value changes of the underlying items is included in the contractual service margin. As a consequence, the fair value changes are not recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they occur but over the remaining life of the contract. The effective date is Annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 Published May 2017 The amendments aim to improve accounting policy disclosures and to help users of the financial statements to distinguish changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. The effective period is annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. Published February 2021 Narrow scope amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, Practice statement 2 and IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors The IASB issued IFRS 17, Insurance contracts, and thereby started a new epoch of accounting for insurers. Whereas the current standard, IFRS 4, allows insurers to use their local GAAP, IFRS 17 defines clear and consistent rules that will significantly increase the comparability of financial statements. For insurers, the transition to IFRS 17 will have an impact on financial statements and on key performance indicators. Under IFRS 17, the general model requires entities to measure an insurance contract at initial recognition at the total of the fulfilment cash flows comprising the estimated future cash flows, an adjustment to reflect the time value of money and an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk and the contractual service margin. The fulfilment cash flows are remeasured on a current basis each reporting period. 15 Awash Bank S.C.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 2 2.3 Investment in associates 2.4 Foreign currency translation a Functional and presentation currency b Transactions and balances Summary of material accounting policies continued Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and from the translation at exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Bank's functional currency are recognised in profit or loss within other lossincome. Monetary items denominated in foreign currency are translated using the closing rate as at the reporting date. Changes in the fair value of monetary securities denominated in foreign currency classified as available for sale are analysed between translation differences resulting from changes in the amortised cost of the security and other changes in the carrying amount of the security. Translation differences related to changes in amortised cost are recognised in profit or loss, and other changes in carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at fair value, such as equities classified as FVOCI, are included in other comprehensive income. An associate is an entity over which the Bank has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over those policies. The Banks investments in its associates are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Banks share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment. The statement of profit or loss reflects the Banks share of the results of operations of the associate. Any change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Banks OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the Bank recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Bank and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate. After application of the equity method, the Bank determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its associate. At each reporting date, the Bank determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Bank calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, then recognises the loss as Share of profit of an associate and a joint venture in the statement of profit or loss. Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Bank measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in statement of profit or loss. Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Bank operates 'the functional currency'. The functional currency and presentation currency of the Bank is the Ethiopian Birr ETB. 18 Awash Bank S.C.

Effective interest rate and amortised cost b. Amortised cost and gross carrying amount c. Calculation of interest income and expense Summary of material accounting policies continued The amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance or impairment allowance before 1 July 2018. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance. the gross carrying amount of the financial asset the amortised cost of the financial liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis. For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the asset. The calculation of interest income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves. Interest income and expense are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset when the asset is not credit-impaired or to the amortised cost of the liability. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Bank and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty. The Bank earns income from interest on loans and advances given to customers, service charges and commissions from customers, interest income from Deposits with local and correspondent banks, investment in NBE National Bank of Ethiopia bills. Other income includes incomes like foreign currency transactions, dividend, rental, and other miscellaneous incomes. When calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments other than credit-impaired assets, the Bank estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not expected credit losses. For credit-impaired financial assets, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate is calculated using estimated future cash flows including expected credit losses. The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, if the amount is material. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability. 19 Awash Bank S.C.

Other fees and commission income such as rental income, telephone and SWIFT are recognised as the related services are performed. Interest income and expense on all trading assets and liabilities are considered to be incidental to the Banks trading operations and are presented together with all other changes in the fair value of trading assets and liabilities in net trading income.

This is recognised when the Banks right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when the shareholders approve and declare the dividend. These are gains and losses arising on settlement and translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the functional currencys mid rate of exchange at the reporting date. This amount is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and it is further broken down into realised and unrealised portion. The monetary assets and liabilities include financial assets within the foreign currencies deposits received and held on behalf of third parties etc. When a loan commitment is not expected to result in the draw-down of a loan, loan commitment fees are recognised on a straight-line basis over the commitment period. Other fees and commission expenses relate mainly to transaction and service fees and are expensed as the services are received. 20 Awash Bank S.C.

Classification and subsequent measurement i Financial assets the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest SPPI. A debt instrument shall be measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated at FVTPL the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI. On initial recognition, a financial asset shall be classified either as measured at either amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI or fair value through profit or loss FVTPL. The Bank shall measure a financial asset at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated at FVTPL Summary of material accounting policies continued On initial recognition, an equity investment that is held for trading shall be classified at FVTPL. However, for equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income OCI. This election is made on an investment-by- investment basis. The Bank shall initially recognise loans and advances, deposits, debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities on the date on which they are originated. All other financial instruments including regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets shall be recognised on the trade date, which is the date on which the Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset or financial liability shall be measured initially at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. All other financial assets that do not meet the classification criteria at amortised cost or FVOCI, above, shall be classified as measured at FVTPL. In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI or at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise . 21 Awash Bank S.C.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 2 2.6 Financial assets and financial liabilities continued - Business model assessment - Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Bank considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Bank considers For the purposes of this assessment, principal shall be defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. Interest shall be defined as the consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs, as well as profit margin. the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular, whether managements strategy focuses on earning contractual interest revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Banks management the risks that affect the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model and its strategy for how those risks are managed how managers of the business are compensated e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected and the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Banks stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised. Summary of material accounting policies continued Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis shall be measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. Financial assets shall not be reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Bank changes its business model for managing financial assets. The Bank shall make an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes 22 Awash Bank S.C. Financial Statments For the year ended 30 June 2024 Notes to the Financial Statments Continued AWASH BANK 64 ANNUAL REPORT Awash Bank S.C.

Summary of material accounting policies continued contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows leverage features prepayment and extension terms terms that limit the Banks claim to cash flows from specified assets e.g. non-recourse loans and features that modify consideration of the time value of money e.g. periodical reset of interest rates. The Bank shall classify its financial liabilities, other than financial guarantees and loan commitments, as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial guarantee is an undertakingcommitment that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified party fails to meet its obligation when due in accordance with the contractual terms. The Bank shall recognise loss allowances for expected credit losses ECL on the following financial instruments that are not measured at FVTPL debt investment securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other financial instruments other than lease receivables on which credit risk has not increased significantly since their initial recognition. financial assets that are debt instruments lease receivables financial guarantee contracts issued and loan commitments issued. No impairment loss shall be recognised on equity investments. Financial guarantees issued by the Bank are initially measured at their fair values and, if not designated as at FVTPL, are subsequently measured at the higher of the amount of the obligation under the guarantee, as determined in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with the revenue recognition policies. The Bank shall measure loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except for the following, which are measured as 12-month ECL 23 Awash Bank S.C.

If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset. ECL is a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. It shall be measured as follows Loss allowances for lease receivables shall always be measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. 12-month ECL is the portion of ECL that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Financial instruments for which a 12-month ECL is recognised are referred to as Stage 1 financial instruments. Summary of material accounting policies continued Life-time ECL is the ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument. Financial instruments for which a lifetime ECL is recognised but which are not credit-impaired are referred to as Stage 2 financial instruments. Other wise, the financial instruments classified as Stage 3 financial instruments. for financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date stage 1 and 2 as the present value of all cash shortfalls i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the Bank in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive for financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date stage 3 as the difference between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows for undrawn loan commitments as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Bank if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive and for financial guarantee contracts as the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that the Bank expects to recover. 24 Awash Bank S.C.

The combined amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a provision and for debt instruments measured at FVOCI no loss allowance is recognised in the statement of financial position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance shall be disclosed and is recognised in the fair value reserve. At each reporting date, the Bank shall assess whether financial assets carried at amortised cost, debt financial assets carried at FVOCI, and finance lease receivables are credit impaired referred to as Stage 3 financial assets. A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrowers condition shall be considered to be credit-impair unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more shall be considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer a breach of contract such as a default or past due event the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Bank on terms that the Bank would not consider otherwise it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation or the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties. 25 Awash Bank S.C.

Derecognition i Financial assets Loans and debt securities shall be written off either partially or in full when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the amount in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Bank determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment shall be carried out at the individual asset level. Summary of material accounting policies continued The Bank shall derecognise a financial asset when Where the Bank determines that the guarantee is not an integral element of the debt instrument, then it shall recognise an asset representing any prepayment of guarantee premium and a right to compensation for credit losses. The contractual right to the cash flows from the financial asset expires, or It transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. The Bank shall assess whether a financial guarantee contract held is an integral element of a financial asset that is accounted for as a component of that instrument or is a contract that is accounted for separately. Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Banks procedures for recovery of amounts due. Where the Bank determines that the guarantee is an integral element of the financial asset, then any premium payable in connection with the initial recognition of the financial asset shall be treated as a transaction cost of acquiring it. The Bank shall consider the effect of the protection when measuring the fair value of the debt instrument and when measuring ECL. Recoveries of amounts previously written off shall be included in impairment losses on financial instruments in the statement of profit or loss and OCI. 26 Awash Bank S.C.

Modifications of financial assets and financial liabilities i Financial assets If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the Bank plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it shall first consider whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place. fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs shall be included in the initial measurement of the asset and other fees are included in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition. Summary of material accounting policies continued Any interest in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Bank shall be recognised as a separate asset or liability. If the terms of a financial asset are modified, then the Bank shall evaluate whether the cash flows of the modified asset are substantially different. Any cumulative gainloss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI shall not be recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities. The Bank shall derecognise a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset shall be deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset shall be derecognised and a new financial asset shall be recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modification shall be accounted for as follows On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised and the sum of i the consideration received including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed and ii any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI shall be recognised in profit or loss. Where the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the Bank shall first recalculate the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognises the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. Any costs or fees incurred and fees received as part of the modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and shall be amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset. 27 Awash Bank S.C.

Summary of material accounting policies continued Where the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost of the liability shall be recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any costs and fees incurred are recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial liability by re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument. Where such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower, then the gain or loss shall be presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it shall be presented as interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method. The Bank shall derecognise a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms shall be recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. Consideration paid shall include non- financial assets transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability. Financial assets and financial liabilities shall be offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Bank currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 28 Awash Bank S.C.

Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Bank recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in statement of profit or loss as incurred. Murabaha is an interest free financing transaction which represents an agreement whereby the Bank buys a commoditygood and sells it to a counterparty customer based on a promise received from that counterparty to buy the commodity according to specific terms and conditions. The selling price comprises of the cost of the commoditygoods and a pre-agreed profit margin. Cash comprises cash on hand, deposits held on call with other banks, and other short term highly liquid investments. Cash equivalents are deemed of immediate realization since they are easily convertible into cash within three months following the date of the financial statements.

Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value of the asset is included in statement of profit or loss. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. Capital work-in-progress is not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use. They are disclosed when reclassified during the year. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows The Bank construct buildings in different cities mainly for image building, branches office and issue accounts use. The remaining is rented out. If the building is rented up to 80 of the floor of the building, the building shall be treated as PPE.

Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in statement of profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred . The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life, or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset, are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or methodology, as appropriate, which are then treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expenses on intangible assets with finite lives are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss, if significant. Amortisation is calculated using the straightline method to write down the cost of intangible assets to their residual values over the lower of their estimated useful lives of six years or by the license duration for purchased computer software. Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. The Bank has opted to subsequently carry investment property at cost and disclose fair value. Fair value is based on comparative market prices, adjusted if necessary, for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific asset. If this information is not available, the Bank uses alternative valuation methods, such as recent prices on less active markets or discounted cash flow projections. Valuations are performed as of the reporting date by professional values who hold recognized and relevant professional qualifications and have recent experience in location and category of the investment property being valued. These valuations from the basis for the carrying amounts in the financial statements. Summary of material accounting policies continued Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, are classified as investment properties. Recognition of investment properties takes place only when it is probable that the future economic benefits that are associated with the investment property will flow to the Bank and the cost can be reliably measured. This is usually when all risks are transferred. Some properties comprise a portion that is held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation and another portion that is held for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. If the portions could not be sold separately, the property is investment property only if an insignificant portion is held for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. 31 Awash Bank S.C.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 2 2.11 Investment Property continued 2.12 Impairment of non-financial assets The Bank assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Bank estimates the assets recoverable amount. An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units CGU fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre- tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. The Bank bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Banks CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. The fair value of investment property reflects, the near current market conditions. The fair value of investment property does not reflect future capital expenditure that will improve or enhance the property and does not reflect the related future benefits from this future expenditure other than those a rational market participant would take into account when determining the value of the property. Summary of material accounting policies continued Subsequent expenditure is capitalized to the assets carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. When part of an investment property is replaced, the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. Investment properties are derecognized when they have been disposed. Where the Bank disposes of a property at fair value in an arms length transaction, the carrying value immediately prior to the sale is adjusted to the transaction price, and the adjustment is recorded in the statement of changes in net assets available for benefit. 32 Awash Bank S.C.

The amount is initially capitalized in the reporting period in which the payment is made and subsequently amortised over the period in which the service is to be enjoyed. Other receivables are recognised upon the occurrence of an event or transaction as they arise and are cancelled when payment is received. The Bank measures financial instruments classified as available-for-sale at fair value at each statement of financial position date. Fair value related disclosures for financial instruments and non-financial assets that are measured at fair value or where fair values are disclosed are, summarised in the following notes Disclosures for valuation methods, significant estimates and assumptions Notes 3 and Note 4.7.1 Quantitative disclosures of fair value measurement hierarchy Note 4.7.2 Financial instruments including those carried at amortised cost Note 4.7.2 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either In the principal market for the asset or liability, or In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Bank estimates the assets or CGUs recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Other assets are generally defined as claims held against other entities for the future receipt of money. The other assets in the Bank's financial statements include the following Summary of material accounting policies continued 33 Awash Bank S.C.

Wages, salaries, other allowances, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Bank. The Bank operates an accumulating leave policy this can be encashed when the employee is leaving employment or paid in cash if the bank rarely decides to pay in cash. The Bank measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount that the entity expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end of each reporting period. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. The Bank uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole Level 1 Quoted unadjusted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable. Level 3 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Bank determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period. The Banks management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement, such as available-for-sale financial assets.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 2 2.15 Employee benefits continued b Defined contribution plan c Defined benefit plan d Termination benefits e The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The Bank recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to the companys shareholders after certain adjustments. The Bank recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation. Profit-sharing and bonus plans The Bank operates a defined contribution plans of pension scheme in line with the provisions of Ethiopian Pension of Private Organisation Employees Proclamation No. 7152011. Funding under the scheme is 7 and 11 by employees and the Bank respectively 2 provident fund contribution is made by the bank for employees covered under pension scheme. The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognised in the statement of profit or loss in employee benefit expense, except where included in the cost of an asset, reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes curtailments and settlements. Past-service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Summary of material accounting policies continued Termination benefits are payable to both managerial and non-managerial employees when employment is terminated by the Bank before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Bank recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. 35 Awash Bank S.C.

When the Bank expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in statement of profit or loss net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as other operating expenses. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The legal reserve which is a statutory reserve to which no less than 25 of the net profits after taxation shall be transferred each year until such fund is equal to the capital. When the legal reserve equals the capital of the Bank, the amount to be transferred to the legal reserve account shall be 10 of the annual net profit. The Bank presents basic earnings per share for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Bank by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Bank allocates consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone price. However, for leases of branches and office premises the Bank has elected not to separate non-lease components and accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. 36 Awash Bank S.C.

The Bank presents right-of-use assets in property and equipment and lease liabilities in other liabilities in the statement of financial position. The Bank determines its incremental borrowing rate by analysing its borrowings from various external sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of asset leased. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Banks incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Bank uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and the exercise price under a purchase option that the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Bank is reasonably certain not to terminate early. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Banks estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Bank changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment. The Bank recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of- use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove any improvements made to branches or office premises. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The Bank further regularly reviews estimated unguaranteed residual values used in calculating the gross investment in the lease. When the Bank acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether the lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Bank makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Bank considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset. The income tax expense or credit for the year is the tax payable on the current years taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in Ethiopia. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. Deferred tax is recognised as temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when they arise in the same tax reporting group and where there is both the legal right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. At inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Bank allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone selling prices.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 3 3.1 a b Going concern basis 3.2 The preparation of the Banks financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets or liabilities affected in future periods. Other disclosures relating to the Banks exposure to risks and uncertainties include Capital management Note 4.6 Financial risk management and policies Note 4 Judgments In the process of applying the Banks accounting policies, management has made the following judgments, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying values of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The Bank based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances beyond the control of the Bank. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur. Lease commitments - Bank as lessee Estimates and assumptions The Banks management has made an assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern and is satisfied that it has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, management is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Banks ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements continue to be prepared on going concern basis. Critical Accounting Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions The Bank has entered into commercial property leases. The Bank has determined, based on an evaluation of the terms and conditions of the arrangements, such as the lease term not constituting a substantial portion of the economic life of the commercial property, that it does not retain all the significant risks and rewards of ownership of these properties and accounts for the contracts as leases. 39 Awash Bank S.C.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 3 3.2 a b Impairment losses on loans and receivables The Bank reviews its loan portfolios for impairment on an on-going basis. The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for loans and receivables that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for loans and receivables that are not individually significant. Impairment provisions are also recognised for losses not specifically identified but which, experience and observable data indicate are present in the portfolio at the date of assessment. For individually significant loans and receivables that have been deemed to be impaired, management deems that the cash flow from collateral would arise within one year where the loans and receivables is back by collateral. Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the portfolio when scheduling its future cash flows. The methodology and assumptions used for estimating both the amount and timing of future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience. The use of historical loss experience is supplemented with significant management judgment to assess whether current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual level of inherent losses is likely to differ from that suggested by historical experience. In normal circumstances, historical experience provides objective and relevant information from which to assess inherent loss within each portfolio. In other circumstances, historical loss experience provides less relevant information about the inherent loss in a given portfolio at the balance sheet date, for example, where there have been changes in economic conditions such that the most recent trends in risk factors are not fully reflected in the historical information. In these circumstances, such risk factors are taken into account when calculating the appropriate levels of impairment allowances, by adjusting the impairment loss derived solely from historical loss experience. The detailed methodologies, areas of estimation and judgment applied in the calculation of the Bank's impairment charge on financial assets are set out in the financial risk management section. The estimation of impairment losses is subject to uncertainty, which has increased in the current economic environment and is highly sensitive to factors such as the level of economic activity, unemployment rates, property price trends and interest rates. The assumptions underlying this judgement are highly subjective. The methodology and the assumptions used in calculating impairment losses are reviewed regularly in the light of differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience. Fair value measurement of financial instruments When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the statement of financial position cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow DCF model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required in establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. As at year end, no financial instrument was measured at fair value.

The fair value less costs of disposal calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions, conducted at arms length, for similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a DCF model. The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Bank is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the assets performance of the CGU being tested. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. Defined benefit plans The cost of the defined benefit pension plan, long service awards and gratuity scheme and the present value of these defined benefit obligations are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. Depreciation and carrying value of property, plant and equipment The estimation of the useful lives and residual values of assets is based on managements judgement. Any material adjustment to the estimated useful lives of items of property and equipment will have an impact on the carrying value of these items.

This process of risk management is critical to the Banks continuing profitability and each individual within the Bank is accountable for the risk exposures relating to his or her responsibilities. The Bank is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and different operational risks. It is also subject to various risks that affect the financial sector of the country. The independent risk control process does not include business risks such as changes in the environment, technology and industry. The Bank's policy is to monitor those business risks through the Banks strategic planning process. The Board Risk Sub-Committee, a subset of the Board of Directors is responsible for the overall risk management approach and for approving the risk management strategies and principles. It also has the responsibility to monitor the overall risk process within the Bank. The Senior Management chaired by the chief Executive Officer CEO has the overall responsibility for the development of the risk strategy and implementing principles, frameworks, policies and limits. It is also responsible for managing risk decisions and monitoring risk levels and reports on a monthly basis to the Board Risk Sub- Committee. The Risk Management Unit is responsible for implementing and maintaining risk related procedures to ensure an independent control process is maintained. The unit works closely with the Senior Management to ensure that procedures are compliant with the overall framework. The Risk Management Unit is responsible for monitoring compliance with risk principles, policies and limits across the Bank. It carries out an assessment of risk on an ad hoc basis to monitor the Bank's independent control of risks, including monitoring the risk of exposures against limits and the assessment of risks of new products and structured transactions. This unit also ensures the complete capture of the risks in risk measurement and reporting systems. Exceptions are reported, where necessary, to the Senior Management, and further to the Board Risk Sub-Committee and the relevant actions are taken to address exceptions and any areas of weakness. The Bank Finance and Treasury function is responsible for managing the Banks financial assets, financial liabilities and the overall financial structure. It is also primarily responsible for the funding and liquidity risks of the Bank. The Banks policy is that risk management processes throughout the Bank are audited annually by the Internal Audit Function, which examines both the adequacy of the procedures and the Banks compliance with the procedures. The Internal Audit Function discusses the results of all assessments with management, and reports its findings and recommendations to the Board Audit Sub-Committee. 42 Awash Bank S.C.

The models make use of probabilities derived from historical experience, adjusted to reflect the economic environment. The Bank also runs worst-case scenarios that would arise in the event that extreme events, which are unlikely to occur, do in fact, occur. Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily performed based on limits established by the Bank. These limits reflect the business strategy and market environment of the Bank as well as the level of risk that the Bank is willing to accept, with additional emphasis on selected regions. In addition, the Banks policy is to measure and monitor the overall risk bearing capacity in relation to the aggregate risk exposure across all risk types and activities. Risk controls and mitigates, identified and approved for the Bank, are documented for existing and new processes and systems. The adequacy of these mitigates is tested on a periodic basis through administration of control self-assessment questionnaires, using an operational risk management tool which requires risk owners to confirm the effectiveness of established controls. These are subsequently audited as part of the review process. The Bank's financial assets are classified into the following measurement categories Financial assets at fair value through OCI and Financial assets at amortized cost and the financial liabilities are classified into other liabilities at amortised cost. Financial instruments are classified in the statement of financial position in accordance with their legal form and substance. - Financial assets at amortized cost 43 Awash Bank S.C.

Our credit exposure comprises wholesale and retail Financial assets at amortized cost which are developed to reflect the needs of our customers. The Banks policy is to lend principally on the basis of our customers repayment capacity through quantitative and qualitative evaluation. However we ensure that our loans are backed by collateral to reflect the risk of the obligors and the nature of the facility. Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Bank if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Banks loans and advances to customers and other banks and other financial assets. Exposure to credit risk is managed through periodic analysis of the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to determine their capacity to meet principal and interest thereon, and restructuring such limits as appropriate. Exposure to credit risk is also mitigated, in part, by obtaining collateral, commercial and personal guarantees. The Bank structures the levels of credit risk it undertakes by placing limits on the amount of risk accepted in relation to one borrower, or groups of borrowers, and to term of the financial instrument and economic sectors. The National Bank of Ethiopia NBE sets credit risk limit for a single borrower, one related party and all related parties to not exceed 25, 5 and 35 of Banks total capital amount as of the reporting quarterly period respectively. Credit management is conducted as per the risk management policy and guideline approved by the board of directors and the Risk Management Committees. Such policies are reviewed and modified periodically based on changes and expectations of the markets where the Bank operates, regulations, and other factors. 44 Awash Bank S.C.

However, collateral provides additional security and the Bank generally requests that corporate borrowers provide it. The Bank may take collateral in the form of a first charge over real estate, floating charges over all corporate assets and other liens and guarantees. Because of the Banks focus on customers creditworthiness, the Bank does not routinely update the valuation of collateral held against all loans to customers. Valuation of collateral of real estates buildings is updated and reviewed every three year and at the same time whenever the loan foreclosure measure is opted. For credit- impaired loans, the Bank obtains appraisals of collateral because it provides input into determining the management credit risk actions. As at 30 June 2024, the net carrying amount of credit impaired loans and advances to customers amounted to ETB 2.013 billion 2023 ETB 1.807 billion and the value of identifiable collateral held against those loans and advances amounted to ETB 2.974 billion 2023 ETB 1.903 billion. For each loan, the value of disclosed collateral is capped at the nominal amount of the loan that it is held against. As at 30 June 2024, the Bank had no exposure to credit risk of the investment securities designated as at FVTPL. Amounts arising from ECL The objective of the assessment is to identify whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred for an exposure by comparing ii Significant increase in credit risk When determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Bank considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Banks historical experience and expert credit assessment and including forward-looking information. 52 Awash Bank S.C.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 4 Financial risk management Continued 4.3 Credit risk Continued 4.3.6 iii Credit risk grades The Bank allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on a variety of data that is determined to be predictive of the risk of default and applying experienced credit judgement. Credit risk grades are defined using qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of risk of default. These factors vary depending on the nature of the exposure and the type of borrower. Credit risk grades are defined and calibrated such that the risk of default occurring increases exponentially as the credit risk deteriorates so, for example, the difference in risk of default between credit risk grades 1 and 2 is smaller than the difference between credit risk grades 2 and 3. Each exposure is allocated to a credit risk grade on initial recognition based on available information about the borrower. Exposures are subject to ongoing monitoring, which may result in an exposure being moved to a different credit risk grade. The monitoring typically involves use of the following data iv Generating the term structure of PD Payment record this includes overdue status as well as a range of variables about payment ratios Utilisation of the granted limit Requests for and granting of forbearance Existing and forecast changes in business, financial and economic conditions Amounts arising from ECL Continued b. Overdraft exposures Credit risk grades are a primary input into the determination of the term structure of PD for exposures. The Bank collects performance and default information about its credit risk exposures analysed by type of product and borrower as well as by credit risk grading. The Bank employs statistical models to analyse the data collected and generate estimates of the remaining lifetime PD of exposures and how these are expected to change as a result of the passage of time. a. Term loan exposures Information obtained during periodic review of customer files e.g. audited financial statements, management accounts, budgets and projections. Examples of areas of particular focus are gross profit margins, financial leverage ratios, debt service coverage, compliance Data from credit reference agencies, press articles, changes in external credit ratings Actual and expected significant changes in the political, regulatory and technological environment of the borrower or in its business activities Internally collected data on customer behaviour e.g. utilisation of credit card facilities Affordability metrics 53 Awash Bank S.C.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 4 Financial risk management Continued 4.3 Credit risk Continued 4.3.6 As a backstop, the Bank considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when an asset is more than 30 days past due. Days past due are determined by counting the number of days since the earliest elapsed due date in respect of which full payment has not been received. Due dates are determined without considering any grace period that might be available to the borrower. The Bank assesses whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition at each reporting date. Determining whether an increase in credit risk is significant depends on the characteristics of the financial instrument and the borrower. The credit risk may also be deemed to have increased significantly since initial recognition based on qualitative factors linked to the Banks credit risk management processes that may not otherwise be fully reflected in its quantitative analysis on a timely basis. This will be the case for exposures that meet certain heightened risk criteria, such as placement on a watch list. Such qualitative factors are based on its expert judgment and relevant historical experiences. v Determining whether credit risk has increased Amounts arising from ECL Continued the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank in full, without recourse by the Bank to actions such as realising security if any is held Overdrafts are considered as being past due once the customer has breached an advised limit or been advised of a limit smaller than the current amount outstanding or it is becoming probable that the borrower will restructure the asset as a result of bankruptcy due to the borrowers inability to pay its credit obligations. The Bank considers a financial asset to be in default when If there is evidence that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk relative to initial recognition, then the loss allowance on an instrument returns to being measured as 12-month ECL. Some qualitative indicators of an increase in credit risk, such as delinquency or forbearance, may be indicative of an increased risk of default that persists after the indicator itself has ceased to exist. In these cases, the Bank determines a probation period during which the financial asset is required to demonstrate good behaviour to provide evidence that its credit risk has declined sufficiently. When contractual terms of a loan have been modified, evidence that the criteria for recognising lifetime ECL are no longer met includes a history of up-to-date payment performance against the modified contractual terms. The Bank monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify significant increases in credit risk by regular reviews to confirm that there is no unwarranted volatility in loss allowance from transfers between 12-month PD Stage 1 and lifetime PD Stage 2. vi Definition of default 54 Awash Bank S.C.

Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 4 Financial risk management Continued 4.3 Credit risk Continued 4.3.6 The definition of default largely aligns with that applied by the Bank for regulatory capital purposes . Inputs into the assessment of whether a financial instrument is in default and their significance may vary over time to reflect changes in circumstances. Amounts arising from ECL Continued Periodically, the Bank carries out stress testing of more extreme shocks to calibrate its determination of the upside and downside representative scenarios. A comprehensive review is performed at least annually on the design of the scenarios by a panel of experts that advises the Banks senior management. In assessing whether a borrower is in default, the Bank considers indicators that are External information considered includes economic data and forecasts published by Business Monitor International, an external and independent macroeconomic data body. This is in addition to industry level, semi annual NPL trends across statistically comparable sectors. vii Incorporation of forward-looking information The Bank incorporates forward-looking information into both the assessment of whether the credit risk of an instrument has increased significantly since its initial recognition and the measurement of ECL. For each segment, the Bank formulates three economic scenarios a base case, which is the median scenario, and two less likely scenarios, one upside and one downside. For each sector, the base case is aligned with the macroeconomic models information value output, a measure of the predictive power of the model, as well as base macroeconomic projections for identified macroeconomic variables for each sector. The upside and downside scenarios are based on a combination of a percentage error factor of each sector model as well as simulated optimistic and pessimistic macroeconomic projections based on a measure of historical macroeconomic volatilities. The Bank has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for each portfolio of financial instruments and, using an analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between macro-economic variables and credit risk and credit losses. 55 Awash Bank S.C.

A customer needs to demonstrate consistently good payment behaviour over a period of time before the exposure is no longer considered to be credit- impairedin default or the PD is considered to have decreased such that the loss allowance reverts to being measured at an amount equal to Stage 1. Amounts arising from ECL Continued When modification results in derecognition, a new loan is recognised and allocated to Stage 1 assuming it is not credit-impaired at that time. Scenario probability weightings As at June 2024 As at June 2023 The contractual terms of a loan may be modified for a number of reasons, including changing market conditions, customer retention and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of the customer. An existing loan whose terms have been modified may be derecognised and the renegotiated loan recognised as a new loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy set out. The Bank renegotiates loans to customers in financial difficulties referred to as forbearance activities to maximise collection opportunities and minimise the risk of default. Under the Banks forbearance policy, loan forbearance is granted on a selective basis if the debtor is currently in default on its debt or if there is a high risk of default, there is evidence that the debtor made all reasonable efforts to pay under the original contractual terms and the debtor is expected to be able to meet the revised terms. The revised terms usually include extending the maturity, changing the timing of interest payments and amending the terms of loan covenants. Both retail and corporate loans are subject to the forbearance policy. The Bank Credit Committee regularly reviews reports on forbearance activities. For financial assets modified as part of the Banks forbearance policy, the estimate of PD reflects whether the modification has improved or restored the Banks ability to collect interest and principal and the Banks previous experience of similar forbearance action. As part of this process, the Bank evaluates the borrowers payment performance against the modified contractual terms and considers various behavioural indicators. viii Modified financial assets When the terms of a financial asset are modified and the modification does not result in derecognition, the determination of whether the assets credit risk has increased significantly reflects comparison of its remaining lifetime PD at the reporting date based on the modified terms with the remaining lifetime PD estimated based on data on initial recognition and the original contractual terms. 57 Awash Bank S.C. Financial Statments For the year ended 30 June 2024 Notes to the Financial Statments Continued AWASH BANK 99 ANNUAL REPORT Awash Bank S.C. Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 4 Financial risk management Continued 4.3 Credit risk Continued 4.3.6 The key inputs into the measurement of ECL are the term structure of the following variables Probability of default PD loss given default LGD and exposure at default EAD The maximum contractual period extends to the date at which the Bank has the right to require repayment of an advance or terminate a loan commitment or guarantee. However, for overdrafts that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment component, the Bank measures ECL over a period longer than the maximum contractual period if the Banks contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the Banks exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period. These facilities do not have a fixed term or repayment structure and are managed on a collective basis. The Bank can cancel them with immediate effect but this contractual right is not enforced in the normal day-to-day management, but only when the Bank becomes aware of an increase in credit risk at the facility level. This longer period is estimated taking into account the credit risk management actions that the Bank expects to take, and that serve to mitigate ECL. These include a reduction in limits, cancellation of the facility andor turning the outstanding balance into a loan with fixed repayment terms. As described above, and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for Stage 1 financial assets, the Bank measures ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period including any borrowers extension options over which it is exposed to credit risk, even if, for credit risk management purposes, the Bank considers a longer period. ix Measurement of ECL EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Bank derives the EAD from the current exposure to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract and arising from amortisation. The EAD of a financial asset is its gross carrying amount at the time of default. For lending commitments, the EADs are potential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated based on historical observations and forward-looking forecasts. For financial guarantees, the EAD represents the amount of the guaranteed exposure when the financial guarantee becomes payable. For some financial assets, EAD is determined by modelling the range of possible exposure outcomes at various points in time using scenario and statistical techniques. LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Bank estimates LGD parameters based on the history of recovery rates of claims against defaulted counterparties. The LGD models consider the structure, collateral, seniority of the claim, counterparty industry and recovery costs of any collateral that is integral to the financial asset. Amounts arising from ECL Continued ECL for exposures in Stage 1 is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD by LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated by multiplying the lifetime PD by LGD and EAD. The methodology of estimating PDs is discussed above under the heading Generating the term structure of PD. 58 Awash Bank S.C.

The cash flows presented are the undiscounted amounts to be settled in future. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank cannot meet its maturing obligations when they become due, at reasonable cost and in a timely manner. Liquidity risk arises because of the possibility that the Bank might be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due as a result of mismatches in the timing of the cash flows under both normal and stress circumstances. Such scenarios could occur when funding needed for illiquid asset positions is not available to the Bank on acceptable terms. Liquidity risk management in the Bank is solely determined by the Asset and Liability Committee ALCO, which bears the overall responsibility for liquidity risk. The main objective of the Bank's liquidity risk framework is to maintain sufficient liquidity in order to ensure that we meet our maturing obligations. Cash flow forecasting is performed by the Finance and Treasury function. The Finance and Treasury function monitors rolling forecasts of liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs. The Bank has incurred indebtedness in the form of borrowings. The Bank evaluates its ability to meet its obligations on an ongoing basis. Based on these evaluations, the Bank devises strategies to manage its liquidity risk. Prudent liquidity risk management implies that sufficient cash is maintained and that sufficient funding is available to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk of damage to the Banks reputation. 63 Awash Bank S.C.

Market risk is defined as the risk of loss that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market risk factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads and their volatilities. Market risk can arise in conjunction with trading and non-trading activities of a financial institutions. The Bank does not ordinarily engage in trading activities as there are no active markets in Ethiopia. The main objective of Market Risk Management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will be affected by changes in market interest rates. Borrowings and lending obtained at variable rates give rise to interest rate risk. The Banks exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Banks obligations and financial assets with floating interest rates. The Bank is also exposed on fixed rate financial assets and financial liabilities. The Banks investment portfolio is comprised of treasury bills, Ethiopian government bonds and cash deposits. 64 Awash Bank S.C.

Credit equivalent for off-balance Capital adequacy ratio The capital adequacy ratio is the quotient of the capital base of the Bank and the Banks risk weighted asset base. IFRS 13 requires an entity to classify measured or disclosed fair values according to a hierarchy that reflects the significance of observable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, which comprises three levels as described below, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole.

Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources unobservable inputs reflect the Bank's market assumptions. - Financial assets at amortized cost Loans and advances to customers The following table summarises the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts are based on the values recognised in the statement of financial position. Level 1 Inputs that are quoted market prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i.e. as prices or indirectly i.e. derived from prices .This category includes instruments valued using quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active, another valuation technique in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data. In conclusion, this category is for valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable. Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs. This category includes all assets and liabilities for which the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the asset's or liability's valuation. This category includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments for which significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments. - Financial assets at fair value through OCI Fair value of financial assets and liabilities 69 Awash Bank S.C.

The Bank leases buildings for its office space and branches. The building leases typically run for a period between 2 and 15 years with the majority of the contracts running for a period of 5 and 7 years. Some leases include an option to renew the lease for an additional period at the end of the contract term. The renewal term and lease rental cannot be reliably estimated before the end of a contract. The Bank leases land for construction of its own office buildings. The land leases typically run for a period of between 23 years and 70 years with majority of the contracts running for a period of 23 and 60 years. These leases include an option to renew the lease.

Rental income from investment and other properties classified under Investment property and PPE Fair value measurement of the Bank's Investment properties Investment properties include those held for rental purposes and those in which the Bank occupies an insignificant portion. These properties are held to earn rentals and for capital appreciation. There are currently no restrictions on the realisability of these properties. Investment properties are initially measured at fair value as deemed cost and subsequently measured at depreciated cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate costs less residual values over the estimated useful lives of 50 years. The fair value of investment properties has been disclosed as required. The carrying amount of the Bank's investment property as at 30 June 2024 is ETB 66.368 million. The fair value of the Bank's investment property has been arrived at by in-house engineers, qualified estate surveyors and valuers. These valuers have appropriate qualifications and recent experience in the valuation of properties in the relevant locations. The fair value was determined based on the replacement cost concept which approximates the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction after proper marketing, prudently and without compulsion. This implies a market comparable approach that reflects the recent transaction prices for similar properties. In estimating the fair value of the properties, the highest and best use of the properties is their current use. There has been no change to the valuation technique during the year. 85 Awash Bank S.C.

The employee benefit plan is made up of two 2 unfunded schemes which are severance benefits that are paid on voluntary withdrawal and retirement gratuity paid on retirement. These plans have been aggregated in determining the retirement benefit obligation as the inherent risks applicable to these plans have been assessed not to be materially different. The key financial assumptions are the discount rate and the rate of salary increases. The provision for gratuity was based on an independent actuarial valuation performed by QED Actuaries Consultants Pty Ltd using the projected unit credit method. The Bank does not maintain any assets for the schemes but ensures that it has sufficient funds for the obligations as they crystallise. 90 Awash Bank S.C.

Employees who attain this age while in a managerial position are entitled to 3 months final monthly salary while for other employees, it is 2 months final salary. The scheme is not funded hence, there are no plan assets. Bank Paid Benefits The bank valued severance benefits payable on death or resignation after a minimum of 5 years service only for all employees, as it is applied by the Bank. Furthermore, one months salary is divided by 30 to get the daily salary applied in the severance benefit calculation. The severance benefits are based on statutory severance benefits in Ethiopia. The statutory severance benefits are set out in Labour Proclamation No. 11562019. This benefit is summarised below Clause 39 1 h of the Labour Proclamation sets out that any worker who has completed their probation and who is not eligible for pension is entitled to a severance benefit h Where he has given service to the employer for a minimum of five years service and his contract of employment is terminated because of sickness or death or his contract of employment is terminated on his own initiative provided that he has no contractual obligation relating to training to render service to the employer. Clause 40 of the Labour Proclamation sets out the amount of the benefit, as follows The benefit applicable would be thirty times the average daily wages of their last week of service for the first year of service, with part-years pro-rata, plus ten times the average daily wages of their last week of service for each completed year of service after the first. To a maximum of one years wages payable to the member.Where the Company closes or reduces its work force, an additional multiple of sixty times the average daily wages of their last week of service is payable.

For ages over 47 we have assumed that mortality will be in line with the SA8590 ultimate standard South African mortality tables published by the Actuarial Society of South Africa ASSA, since the rates in these tables are similar to the DHS female mortality rate at age 47.

Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the profit after taxation by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

Provisions under prudential guidelines are determined using the time based provisioning prescribed by the National Bank of Ethiopia NBE Directives. This is at variance with the expected credit loss model required by IFRS under IFRS 9. As a result of the differences in the provision, there will be variances in the impairments allowances required under the two methodologies. Similarly, interest on non-performing loans are suspended as per NBE directive, while IFRS 9 prescribes to recognize stage 3 loans interest income net of impairement losses. The proclamation Financial Reporting Proclamation No.8472014 stipulates that Banks would be required to make provisions for financial assets as prescribed in the relevant IFRS Standards when IFRS is adopted. However, Banks would be required to comply with the following Prudential provisions is less than IFRS provisions IFRS determined provision is charged to the statement of comprehensive income. The cumulative balance in the regulatory risk reserve is thereafter reversed to the general reserve account. Interest suspended in the previous years and regularized in the current year is compared with current year stage 3 loans interest income recognized net of impairment losses. The difference between the two is transferred to regulatory risk reserve. a Provisions for loans advances and other assets are recognised in the income statement based on the requirements of IFRS.
