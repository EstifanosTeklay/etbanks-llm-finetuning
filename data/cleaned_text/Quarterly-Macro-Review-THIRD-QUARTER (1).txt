Recent Developments and Outlook The conflict that has broken out in Ethiopia over the past few weeks appearsbased on recent developmentslikely to be short-lived in its duration and confined in its geographic scope. Under these circumstances, adverse impacts on the macroeconomy should be quite limited, in our view, especially since Government is also pushing ahead with key economic reforms, including privatization. While we will revisit our macro projections more fully in early 2021, in line with evolving developments, this note presents the tentative signs of a V-shaped recovery that were emerging before the conflict arose and that we think will gain momentum in the period ahead. Compared to our last review, we now see somewhat slower growth and somewhat higher inflation for this year, but expect a still favorable outlook with respect to the budgetary stance, banking activity, and balance of payment flows. Growth The recently released growth figure of 6.1 percent for 2019-20 shows economic activity held up much better than expected, as agriculture and construction GDPs two largest components were largely spared from COVID shocks. For this fiscal year, we forecast growth of 4.1 percent on expectations of weaker crop yields due to locusts and a harvest season that is likely to be at least partly disrupted. The IMFs projection of zero GDP growth even pre-conflict exaggerates the impacts of COVID-related shocks, in our view. Inflation The central bank has stopped financing government deficits since end-June, which is helping control the monetary sources of inflation unfortunately, other factors are keeping inflation at elevated levels 19. We now project inflation of 13 percent by mid-2021, and see prospects for single-digit inflation emerging only in the second half of 2021. Fiscal policy Even with large government spending increases this year, the budget deficit is worsening only slightly from 2.6 to 3.1 of GDP and the debt-to-GDP ratio staying below 60 percent despite multiple shocks. A further deficit deterioration linked to the conflict seems unlikely given what are already large allocations in the budget for defence security. Debt service relief from external lenders is reducing repayment burdens in 2020 and 2021. Banking Aided by the recent currency conversion, banks should see another year of good performance already apparent in their first quarter figures, and we now expect 22 percent deposit growth and 18 percent lending growth. A gradual withdrawal of loose monetary conditions, a likely uptick in NPLs, and reduced loan demand in some areas will be key challenges, but these should moderatenot hold backoverall growth in the sector. Balance of Payments Helped by double-digit export growth, a recovery in remittances, improved FDI presuming privatization, and large on-going inflows of grants and loans, foreign exchange reserves should surpass 4bn 3.4 months import cover by mid-2021. Exchange rate The annual rate of depreciation reached a high of 28 percent in October 2020, but the Birr has since begun to show a slower pace of change, in line with moderating inflation and USD weakness vs other global currencies both of which lessen the need for Birr depreciation. As policy efforts are likely to still focus on avoiding any further over-valuation of the currency, and considering the anticipated path of inflation from here on, we see the Birr at near 39 per USD by end-2020 and just under 42 per USD by mid-2021.

Real GDP showed a 6.1 percent expansion during the fiscal year in line with our expectations, reflecting a combination of 4.3 percent growth in agriculture, 9.6 percent growth in industry, and 5.3 percent growth in services. Looking more closely at specific sub-sectors, growth was strongest in mining 91, health care 13, finance 10, construction 10, manufacturing 10 and real estate 10, while areas showing the lowest growth rates were in hotels restaurants 2.2, education 1.8 and transport services 1.1. In terms notable changes from the prior year, the sharpest declines in growth were witnessed in transport services whose growth fell from 21 to 1 percent, hotels and tourism from 9 to 2 percent, and in construction from 15 to 10 percent. Last years GDP growth is the lowest seen in 17 years, though it remains among the highest rates achieved globally the second highest per the IMFs October 2020 WEO database.1 Even if questions were raised about the reliability of the latest growth figures given long-standing weaknesses in the samplingcoveragedeflators used in Ethiopias national accounts statistics, other more easily measured non-GDP activity indicators now available for the full year also point to economic expansion in most areas, and in magnitudes that are not out of line with the reported growth figure. Most notably, real growth rates were 9 in bank lending, 14 in exports, 12 in ECX traded commodities, 7 in electricity generation, and 6 in telecom subscriber volumes. Investment Overall investment fell to near 31 percent of GDP in 2019-20, a significant drop from the 35 percent seen the year before and the 37 percent average of the past five years. This is the lowest rate in over a decade and parallels drops registered in GDP growth from 9 to 6, in foreign investments from 3bn to 2.4bn, and in capital imports from 5bn to 4.1bn. Some indicators of public sector investment did, however, show growth in real terms, such as government capital expenditure which rose from Birr 86bn to Birr 112bn, a 30 percent increase in nominal terms and roughly 11 increase in real terms. Overall, the drop in private investment appears to have been more pronounced than the drop in public investment. Inflation After peaking at 22.3 in July, inflation has been on a downward trajectory for most of the past four months, though it showed a slight uptick 1 Cross country growth rates are not quite comparable, given Ethiopias July-June fiscal year. Our comparison is Ethiopias 2019-20 growth 6.1 versus others 2020 calendar year IMF projection.

On the positive front, month-on-month inflation has fallen sharply in recent months, having dropped from 2.9 percent in June equal to a 40 percent annualized rate to just 0.4 percent in October annualized rate of only 5 percent. The moderating inflation readings are being driven by slower price increases for vegetables, housing, and utilities all now in the mid to high-teens, while items with large weights in the indexsuch as grain cereals, beverages, and transportstill show inflation rates above 20 percent. With the monetary sources of inflation apparently becoming much less significant, thanks to zero central bank credit to the government in the first quarter, it appears supply side shocks are the more dominant factors behind the still elevated inflation rates of recent months. Given lags in inflation transmission, the tighter controls seen recently on NBE financing and the current low month-on-month rates shouldbarring additional shocksbegin to show up in better inflation numbers by early to mid-2021. Monetary policy A surprise currency conversion enacted at the start of the Ethiopian New Year September 2020 has proceeded relatively smoothly, with banks registering close to 2.5 million new depositors and benefitting from substantially increased deposits within a short period of time. The currency conversion is unlikelyby itselfto be of major macroeconomic significance, but it may have helped demonetize some past stock of illicit funds as intended, it may bring some net income gains to the central bank as much as Birr 14bn, for example, if say 10 percent of the previous Birr 140bn cash in circulation remains unreturned, and it could help accelerate the adoption of non-cash, digital payment habits for the period ahead given daily cash withdrawal limits that came out alongside the currency conversion. Bank liquidity conditions are also much improved thanks to the influx of new deposits see below. As of end-September 2020, at which point the currency conversion was still not yet finalized, moderate growth was being registered in broad money supplynamely 19 percent from year-ago levels or roughly in line with inflation. Banking developments Commercial bank deposits rose by Birr 105bn in the first quarter of the fiscal year, which is six times the increase seen in the same period last year and amounts to 8 percent growth for the quarter and 25 growth from year-ago levels. Deposits have now reached Birr 1.148 trillion, with 57 percent of this total at public banks and 43 percent at private banks. Total financing provided by the banking system loans plus banks holdings of corporate bonds, NBE Bills, and T-Bills reached an estimated Birr 1.15 trillion at end-Sep 2020, up around 4 percent for the quarter. Given the influx of deposits over the past quarter, this total bank financing figure is now equivalent to 98 percent of total banking system deposits vs a similar ratio of 103 percent in June 2020pointing to improving liquidity conditions in recent months. Based on monetary data for the year to September 2020, the private sector remains the main beneficiary of bank lending growth, with an RESEARCH ANALYTICS Disclaimer This report represents solely the views, analysis, and judgement of the Cepheus research team and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Funds Managing Partners, Advisors, or Investors. 4 estimated Birr 145bn of the Birr 213bn credit increase roughly 61 percent going to private borrowers as opposed to Government or SOEs. In terms of other banking indicators, the sector registered 23 percent growth in assets, 11 percent growth in paid-up capital to Birr 83bn, and 15 percent growth in branches to 6,124 nation-wide branches as of September 2020 or an increase of around 159 branches over the quarter. Private banks continue to show strong lending growth up 8 for the quarter and 36 percent year-on- year, while CBE has strengthened its deposit mobilization up 10 percent in the first quarter but was less active on the lending side up 2 percent in the first quarter. Fiscal policy Budgetary performance is also off to a strong start with record- breaking Q1 revenue collections this year tax receipts reached Birr 74bn in the first three months, above governments targets and a 30 percent jump from year-ago levels. Government expenditure for the quarter reached Birr 98bn, and the resulting quarterly budget deficitafter accounting for Birr 6.4bn of grant inflowswas near Birr 17bn. The domestic borrowing needed to cover this deficit was fully covered by Treasury Bill issues, thanks to an auction market that has seen Birr 51bn in gross sales this past quarter and Birr 95bn cumulative gross issues to end-September including longer maturities that now include a mix of 28-day, 91-day, and 182-day T-bills. Debt Public debt rose to 54.9bn as of June 2020, up by about 1.2bn from year-ago levels. Relative to GDP for FY 2019-20 Birr 3,374bn or 106.8bn, public debt-to-GDP stands at 51.4 percent, a near 8 percentage points drop from June 2018 when the ratio peaked at 59 percent of GDP. Looking only at external debt, this now stands at 27 percent of GDP, also down from its peak of 31 percent seen in June 2018. Trade Exports continue to show double-digit growth and rose by 16 percent from the same period last year. In a historic first, gold exports exceeded coffee this past quarter, bringing in 203mn vs 185mn for coffee. Other notable export categories showed quarterly inflows of 102mn for flowers down 11 percent from same period last year, 95mn for chat up 2 percent, and 58mn for oilseeds up 8 percent. Manufactured exports fared poorly this past quarter, declining around 12 percent from year-ago levels due to drops in textile, leather, and meat exports. With respect to imports, their levels are down 7 percent from year-ago, with sharp drops continuing to be seen in fuel imports 377mn for the quarter, and down 36 percent due to lower global oil prices, raw materials down 18 percent, and capital goods down 5 percent. Exceptions to the generally negative growth rates seen for most import categories were seen for food items up 25 percent, textile sector inputs up 16 percent, and some capital goods components. Balance of payments BOP Balance of payments developments were much less adverse than initially feared, with final figures for the 2019-20 fiscal year RESEARCH ANALYTICS Disclaimer This report represents solely the views, analysis, and judgement of the Cepheus research team and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Funds Managing Partners, Advisors, or Investors. 5 showing the central banks fx reserves loss limited to only around 200mn last year from 3.4bn at end-June 2019 to 3.2bn at end-June 2020. Per NBE data, the overall balance of payments deficit for the year was somewhat larger at around 700mn given accounting conventions that also take into account changes in the banking systems foreign liabilities. The overall BOP deficit reflected a current account deficit of 4bn trade deficit of 11bn, a roughly balanced services account, and net transfers of 7bn, a capital account surplus of 4bn mainly FDI of 2.4bn and net foreign borrowing of near 2bnbn, and a large negative errors and omissions figure of almost 1bn. Last years BOP outturns were notable for 1 a large 1.5bn improvement in the trade deficit 2 an improvement in net services income service exports fell by 6 percent due to COVID impacts on tourism but service imports fell by an even larger amount 3 a 17 percent drop in remittances from 5.7bn to 4.7bn 4 a 20 percent drop in FDI from 3.0bn to 2.4bn and 5 a 30 percent drop in official grants from 2.1bn to 1.5bn. For the first quarter of this fiscal year, the trade deficit stood at 2.6bn versus 3bn in the same period last year or 13 percent lower, while other available Q1 data points show 0.5bn in FDI inflows. Fx reserves rose slightly to 3.3bn at end-September, suggesting net positive BOP flows during the most recent quarteras was also the case in Q4 of 2019-20. Exchange rate The annual rate of depreciation reached a high of 28 percent from year-ago levels in October 2020, but the Birr has since begun to show a slower pace of change 24 percent for November, in line with moderating inflation and USD weakness versus most global currencies. Relative to the Euro and Pound, the Birr is now 35 percent and 28 percent depreciated respectively from year-ago levels. The average exchange rate movement averaged 66 cents per month in the four months from July-October 2020, but this has moderated to 50 cents per month in November 2020 which had been our average monthly expectation for the quarter. As before, the annual depreciation rates of nominal depreciation are at least matching recent year- on-year inflation rates, suggesting again that the central banks exchange rate policy seeks to at least maintain a constant real effective exchange rate REER that can prevent a deterioration in external competitiveness. Sovereign bond and Market Ratings Reflecting the reactions of foreign bond-holders, the prices and yields of Ethiopias sovereign bond moved significantly following the onset of the conflict in November. The bonds yield had previously declined from close to 7 percent at end-June 2020 to 6 percent as of early November, but the start of the conflict on November 3 has since brought about a sharp spike in yields. As of end-November, the latest yield stands at close to 8 percent, which is indicative of the USD interest rate now needed to attract foreign bondholders. No ratings action has been taken in the last quarter by the three global rating agencies Ethiopias rating by Moodys remains at B2 with a negative outlook, while Standard and Poors and Fitch Ratings also retain their long-standing B ratings.

While there remain uncertainties regarding the conflicts ultimate resolution, its apparent short duration based on recent developments and limited geographic scope imply minimal macro impacts. Accordingly, even though we now forecast slightly lower growth and somewhat higher inflation for this year, we expect the outlook to remain favorable with respect to the budgetary stance, banking activity, and balance of payment flows. GDP growth We expect GDP growth will be somewhat lower this year than our previous forecast of 5.5 percent. This revision is driven solely by our updated expectations for this years crop output, and we see no strong basisyetfor reducing our previous projections for growth in industry mainly construction and in service sectors. o For agriculture 38 of GDP, the outlook had generally been quite positive till the end of the rainy season September 2020, reflecting a combination of favorable rainfall, improved fertilizer usage, and some expected increase in acreage farmed following a leave no land uncultivated campaign launched in most regions. On this basis, we had expected that total crop output was likely to rise from last years 335mn quintals to a level at or above 350mn for this year, for around 4 percent growth. However, more recent developments suggest that the locust invasion has affected much larger areas of farmland previously estimated around 200,000 hectares but now potentially as much as 700,000 hectares and lasted for longer periods in some areas. Moreover, harvest activity which normally takes place in November and December is likely to be at least partly disrupted from the recent conflict in parts of northern Ethiopia, having some ultimate impact on crop yields. Reflecting these considerations, plus feedback from experts in the agricultural sector, we think overall crop output is likely to remain broadly at the levels recorded last yearthus registering near zero growthwhich would have the effect of pulling down overall growth. o In the construction sector 18 GDP, we retain our expectations that the significantly increased government budget will be bringing many new projects and hence continued strong activity in this sub-sector. Budget execution trends so far are in line with these expectations given trends in quarterly government spending. Off-budgetary public sector projects especially in housing will also provide further stimulus, while rising cement production and still-strong growth bank lending for the housingconstruction sector up 125 percent year-on-year and now 11 percent of total loans suggests continued on-going expansion in the RESEARCH ANALYTICS Disclaimer This report represents solely the views, analysis, and judgement of the Cepheus research team and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Funds Managing Partners, Advisors, or Investors. 7 private segment as well. Growth in the high single-digits thus remains a strong prospect for FY 2020-21. o For wholesale and retail trade 14 of GDP, activity indicators in the first quarter ECX trading, bank lending, exports are supportive of low to mid-single digit growth in this sector. While crop related trading may be somewhat affected, other trading activities linked to consumer goods, construction activities, exports, and retail can still support moderate growth in this sub-segment. o Other sub-sectors that should continue to show gradually strengthening activity levels, including health given stepped-up allocationsactivities this year, education given the re-starting of educational institutions throughout most parts of the country, and public administration with implementation of this years expanded budget. Financial services activity shows continued strong growth in the first quarter loans up 31 percent while mining activity though still a tiny share of GDP should also show very high rates of growth judging from gold exports and a number of new projects poised to start operations. o The most notable risk to the macro outlook of course concerns the direction ultimately taken in the resolution of the recent conflict, and the potential for on-going disruptions that may affect the broader economy. Also, shortfalls in government funding due to weakened revenue generation capabilities, lower external loans, constrained domestic funding or delayed privatization may reduce government spending and thus hold back the public sector related drivers of GDP growth. o Overall GDP growth Considering all of the above, we reduce our expectation for GDP growth to 4.1 percent for FY 202021 this reflects anticipated growth rates of 094 for agricultureindustryservices and their respective weights of 332938 in real GDP. Recent growth forecasts by external observers mostly before the conflict range from a low of zero by the IMF, which we think exaggerates the likely severity of COVID-related shocks, to 2 percent by Moodys, 3.3 percent by the World Bank, 4.5 percent by Standard Poors, and 8.5 percent by the Government. A consensus average excluding our projections would suggest growth of 3.1 percent for 2020-21. Inflation While sharp drops in recent month-on-month inflation bode well for the direction of future inflation, the still high inflation levels over the past five months of the fiscal year imply a longer disinflation path than we had previously expected. Though we had expected inflation to fall by 16 percent by December and 9 percent by June 2021, the latest inflation readings and the stance of macro policies now suggest these figures will be several percentage points higher for the remainder of the fiscal year. We now RESEARCH ANALYTICS Disclaimer This report represents solely the views, analysis, and judgement of the Cepheus research team and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Funds Managing Partners, Advisors, or Investors. 8 forecast year-on-year inflation of 18 percent at end-December and 13 percent at end-June 2021, with the prospect of single-digit likely to emerge only in the second half of 2021. Fiscal policy and debt Fiscal policy looks to be on track and in line with the budget, given impressive revenue outturns recorded in the first quarter Birr 74bn, 105 percent of target. In a very positive development, the now one- year old, market-based Treasury Bill market has provided the domestic financing needed to cover the first quarter deficitwithout resort to central bank credits to the government. With first quarter revenue in line with targets and this continuing to be the case for October 2020, there appear limited risks of major fiscal slippages for the period ahead. A further deficit deterioration linked to the conflict seem unlikely, in our view, as significant allocations were already in the budget this year for defence and security outlays. Humanitarian spending needs that will arise from the recent conflict are also likely to be contained through existing budgetary outlays including re-allocations as well as extra external assistance. Reflecting all of the above, we anticipate the deficit will remain broadly in line with the budget near 3 percent of GDP and that total public debt will reach around 55 percent of GDP by June 2021. Overall, it is notable that despite multiple shocks faced this year including the recent conflict, the COVID pandemic, successive locust invasions, the debt-to-GDP is trending upwards only slightly and not showing any rapid or alarming increases. Monetary developments and banking After substantial loosening in response to the COVID pandemic, the rest of the fiscal year is likely to show moderating growth rates in both reserve money and broad money. A slowdown in broad money growth together with a large domestic borrowing requirement for budget would normally leave limited financing for the private sector this had been our expectations at the start of the fiscal year and explained our previously low 15 percent credit growth projection for this year. However, the recent currency conversion has provided unexpected and ample liquidity to the banking sector as a whole, and so concerns about a squeeze on credit to the private sector our now less pressing. Moreover, while some sub-sectors of the economy may show reduced demand for loans, trends in the first quarter suggest that annual credit growth of close to 20 percent is still possible for the fiscal year. Potential challenges in the sector include a likely uptick in NPLs, as some COVID-affected credits become recognized as non-performing, but the low initial NPL ratios at most private banks should allow them to withstand modest increases given on-going growth in their overall loan books and rising revenues. Looking at broader trends, the financial sector is beginning to see the establishment of new local banks but the entry of other non-bank service providersdespite regulatory looseningremains in its very early stages with still limited activity to date. RESEARCH ANALYTICS Disclaimer This report represents solely the views, analysis, and judgement of the Cepheus research team and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Funds Managing Partners, Advisors, or Investors. 9 Balance of payments We largely retain the BOP projections from our last quarterly report, including our expectations of an improving balance of payments position aided by significant currency depreciation and a still favourable outlook in global commodity markets most notably, low oil prices, high coffee prices, and high gold prices. As before, we see goods exports reaching 3.4bn 14 percent growth from last year and services exports at 14.9bn a 7 percent increase, while we make slight adjustments for remittances expected at 5.1bn, a 6 percent increase, and official grants of 1.5bn, in line with last year. On the capital account, we adjust our FDI projections to 3.5bn accounting for Q1 trends and with expectations that privatization transactions take pace by June 2021, and project net government borrowing of near 1.7bn in line with budget plans. As part of the COVID-related Debt Service Suspension Initiative DSSI from the international community, debt service relief from official multilateral and bilateral creditors is expected to reduce Ethiopias external loan repayment burdens in 2020-21, covering as much as 300mn-500mn in government dues over a 12-month period, by our estimates. Reflecting these anticipated developments, we project that fx reserves will exceed 4bn by June 2021, compared to the 3.2bn stock of fx reserves at end-June 2020. These increased net balance of payments inflows should allow for somewhat improved fx supplies to the private sector over the course of the year. However, with the Birr still some distance from its market rate, and given the gradual approach taken to broader exchange rate system reform, delays in accessing foreign exchange will of course still remain the normat least for this yearfor most businesses in most sectors. Exchange rate After monthly depreciations of 33905980 cents in JulyAugustSeptemberOctober, the Birr has moved by just 50 cents this past month November. For the five months since the start of the fiscal year, the Birrs depreciation has now averaged 62 cents per month. With moderating inflation and significant USD depreciation versus other global currencies in recent months both of which lessen the need for Birr depreciation, we are inclined to expect 50 to 60 cents of monthly Birr adjustmentson averagefor the period ahead. This translates into year- on-year depreciation rates of around 20 percent and would be sufficient to fully cover anticipated rates of inflation. Accordingly, we see the exchange rate at close to 39 BirrUSD by end-December 2020 and just under 42 BirrUSD by June 2021. A summary of our full set of macroeconomic projectionscovering the real, banking, fiscal, and external sectorsis provided in the attached Annex. RESEARCH ANALYTICS Disclaimer This report represents solely the views, analysis, and judgement of the Cepheus research team and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Funds Managing Partners, Advisors, or Investors. 10 ECONOMIC ACTIVITY Recent Developments The 2019-20 fiscal year was able to register still-strong growth of 6.1 percent versus an annual average of 8.5 percent in the prior four years mainly because two-thirds of the year July- February was not affected by COVID-related shocks, while those sectors most impacted by the pandemic towards the end of the fiscal year were generally small segments of the economy. The reduced growth reflects notably lower growth rates in transport, construction, and hotels restaurants. The 6.1 percent growth rate marks the lowest seen in 17 years, or since 2003. Based on the 19 sub-sectors by which Ethiopias GDP data is reported, mining showed a near doubling of output 91 growth, though it makes up only a tiny share of overall GDP. Taking a five-year perspective, the fastest growing sub-sectors in recent years have been construction, manufacturing, finance, transport, and health and social services.

Together with three other line-items in the GDP dataanimal husbandry, forestry, and fishingthe combined agriculture sector shows a 32 percent share in overall GDP, per the categorizations of the National Planning Commission. The investment-to-GDP ratio fell significantly to just 31 percent last year, well below the norms of 35-38 percent seen in prior years. This reflects declines in both domestic and foreign savings.

The fall in the investment ratio parallels sizeable drops also seen relative to GDPin capital goods imports, government capital spending, and foreign investment. Based on ICOR ratios seen over the past five years, about 4.4 percent of GDP in new investment is needed to generate an extra 1 percent of growth in the economy.

Areas of weakness were concentrated in tourism and FDI both of which are so far relatively small shares of the economy. The performance of Ethiopias largest companiesespecially the 23 largest state enterprisesalso suggests an expanding economy, given their 17 percent increase in sales and 6 percent rise in profits.

Tourism arrivals show large declines from year-ago levels, though the picture is more positive when seen sequentially i.e., the monthly developments since April 2020. Several COVID-hit segments of the economy are showing somewhat V-shaped recoveries, including for tourist arrivals, industrial park exports, deposit growth, and government revenues. 4B Monthly Tourist Arrival Numbers March-September 2020 4C Industrial Parks Exportmn Source Tourism Commission Source EIC 0 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 25,000 30,000 35,000 40,000 Mar-20 Apr-20 May-20 Jun-20 Jul-20 Aug-20 Sep-20 Monthly Tourist Arrival Numbers - 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0 12.0 14.0 16.0 18.0 Dec-19 Jan-20 Feb-20 Mar-20 Apr-20 May-20 Jun-20 Jul-20 Aug-20 Sep-20 Monthly Industrial Parks Export 4D Quarterly Deposit Growth Rate 4E Quarterly Revenue Source Banks survey data Source ERCA 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 Dec-19 Jan-20 Feb-20 Mar-20 Apr-20 May-20 Jun-20 Jul-20 Aug-20 Sep-20 Quarterly Deposit Growth Rate 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 201920Q2 201920Q3 201920Q4 202021Q1 Quarterly Revenue Figure 4A Quarterly Activity Indicators FY 2019-20 First Quarter FY 2020-21 First Quarter Nominal growth Real growth Tax collections Birr bns 57.2 74.4 30.1 9.4 ow Direct tax collections 30.7 61.00 98.7 78.1 ow Trade tax collections 26.5 13.40 -49.4 -70.1 Bank deposits Birr bns 917.6 1,148 25.1 4.5 Bank lending Birr bns 475.1 623 31.2 10.6 Bank profits private banks, Birr bns 5.0 8.8 76.6 56.0 Exports of goods mns 723 830 14.8 Imports of goods mns, excl aircraft 3,731 3,466 -7.1 Industrial park exports mns 47 40 -16.1 Industrial park employment 76,289 68,460 -10.3 Tourist arrivals 223,053 46,540 -79.1 Foreign Direct Investment bns 0.7 0.5 -29 Capital Goods Imports USD bns 1,020 966 -5.3 Aircraft imports 16 15 -7.3 Transport-related capital goods 138 107 -22.9 Capital Goods excl aircraft 1,005 951 -5.3 Capital Goods excl aircrafttransport 866 845 -2.5 Source NBE, Ministry of Revenue, Banks survey data, EIC, MOTI RESEARCH ANALYTICS Disclaimer This report represents solely the views, analysis, and judgement of the Cepheus research team and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Funds Managing Partners, Advisors, or Investors. 15 Rainfall and Agriculture Above-average rains were experienced in most parts of the country, which has been positive for this years crop prospects. Higher use of fertilizers whose imports were up 20 percent in FY 2019-20 and a campaign to leave no lands uncultivated also suggested good agricultural prospects, and this should still be the case in most parts of the country. However, despite these promising initial conditions, several rounds of locust invasions have affected farmlands towards the end of rainy season see below, while conflict-related disruptions to harvest activityin November and Decemberappear to be emerging in some areas. Locust infestations have covered a larger than previously expected farm area, with recent estimates suggesting as much as 700,000 hectares around 5.5 percent of total farmland has been impacted. If a high share of the crops on these impacted farms are lost, agriculture growth could be significantly held back, even if the rest of the countrys non-affected farms show some modest growth. On the basis of what we now think is likely to be near-zero agriculture growth, we estimate overall GDP growth at 4.1 percent for the current fiscal year, largely driven by construction activity and moderate growth in services.

PRICES AND INFLATION Recent Developments and Outlook Inflation outturns Overall inflation of 19.3 percent as of end-October reflects a mix of near 23 percent inflation for domestically produced goods, alongside lower inflation rates of 15 percent for imported items and for services. As before, the main products contributing to inflation include grain cereals 24.3, vegetables 19.3, and housing and utility costs 14.6. These three items each have weights of between 12 to 17 percent in the consumer price index, and thus heavily affect trends in overall inflation.

Cereal grains, which represent the single highest component in Ethiopias inflation index, continue to show large increases for teff now Birr 4,470 per quintal vs Birr 3,030 a year ago but moderating price levels for other grains such as maize, wheat, and sorghum. The regional variation in inflation continues to be quite considerable, with inflation rates ranging from a low of 5 percent in the Somali Region to a high of 30 percent in Tigray. The conventionally reported figure, i.e., 19 percent for October 2020, is based on the national average.

Looking ahead, we no longer expect to see negative month-on-month inflation rates for the upcoming harvest months, and thus assume for both November and December rates of monthly inflation in line with the recent outturn. Thereafter, we utilize average month-on-month inflation rates based on historical averages. On this basis, inflation rates would remain in the range of 18 to 19 percent till early 2021, but begin falling to the mid-teens by end- March and towards 13 percent by mid-2021.

Broad money is growing at a more moderate pace of 19 percent on a year- on-year basis. Net central bank credit to government stood at Birr 209bn as of June 2020, and stayed unchanged to end-September, thus showing zero growth for the quarter. Seen over a three-year time frame, broad money growth has been trending downward, while growth in reserve money has moved in the opposite direction, especially within the past year. The latter partly reflects the liquidity support provided by the central bank to help cushion COVID impacts on the banking sector and real economy. Bond issuance Outstanding bond issuance rose 20 percent last year and now stands at Birr 405bn as of end-June 2020. While most of the outstanding bond issues reflect SOE activity, regional governments have raised their bond issuances last year, up to an outstanding stock of Birr 46bn as of June 2020.

BANKING Recent developments and outlook Deposits rose sharply in recent months, and were up 8 percent for the quarter and 25 percent year-on-year. This has occurred even before the end of the currency conversion, which is to be completed in December 2020. Bank lending also continues to show strong growth, though much more so at the private banks rather than at CBE. Seen over a longer time frame, deposit growth has shown erratic patterns lows of 15 percent and highs of 28 percent over the past three years, while lending growth has generally stayed within the range of 25-30 percent on an annual basis. FISCAL POLICY Recent developments Revenue performance Revenue collections in the first quarter exceeding government targets, and were up 30 percent from year-ago levels.

FISCAL POLICY Recent developments While there had been a sharp drop in tax collections due to COVID in the April-June quarter, this is now no longer the case and revenue collections have recovered strongly. Even after accounting for seasonally high tax payments in the June-September period, collections were up from Birr 52bn in Q1 of last fiscal year to Birr 74bn in Q1 of this fiscal year. Final budget performance data for the 2019-20 fiscal year show a deficit of Birr 89bn, or close to 2.6 percent of GDP. Public debt, in USD terms Outstanding public sector debt has risen by 1.2bn over the past year and now stands at 54.9 bn slightly more than half of public debt is now owed to external creditors.

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS BOP Recent developments Full BOP data for last year show an overall deficit of around 700mn when taking into account changes in banking system net foreign assets. The loss in fx reserves during the 2019-20 fiscal year was, however, only about 200mn. On the positive side, FY 2019-20 showed a much lower trade deficit, an improved services account, and a lower current account deficit. The drop in service receipts from lower tourism was offset by an even larger drop in service imports, allowing an overall improvement in the net services balance. Negative trends were registered in remittances, grants, and FDIall three of which were down between 17-30 percent. FX reserves Fx reserves data available to September 2020 show central bank reserves at 3.3bn, up somewhat from the 3.2bn at end-June and notably higher than the 2.6bn than the year-ago levels.

TRADE PERFORMANCE Recent developments Export performance Gold exceeded coffee exports this past quarter, though this may not last as seasonal coffee exports pick up over the coming months. As before, besides gold, the other top exports were agricultural productsincluding flowers, chat, oilseeds and pulses. Electricity exports were near 25mn for the quarter and appear on track to reach 100mn in year- total exports. Manufacturing exports performed poorly during the quarter, with declines seen in textiles, leather, meat, electronics, and construction inputs. In terms of growth rates, besides gold, the other fastest growing export categories were in electricity and oilseeds. Non-gold exports showed negative growth overall -12 percent, which shows underlying weaknesses outside of the few large product categories.

Trends in gold exports show rising NBE purchase prices helping bring about big jumps in monthly export values.

Trade performance continued Import performance Imports continue to show declines over the past quarter, even excluding certain categories such as fuel and aircraft. Lower global oil prices continue to allow for a substantial lower fuel import bill, which is down 36 percent from year-ago levels. Consumer goods, particularly in the other foods category, are among the few import items showing large year-on-year growth rates. Capital goods imports are also falling across all sub-categories, suggesting reduced investment ratios for the broader economy unless this is reversed in the coming quarters.

ETHIOPIAS SOVEREIGN BOND Recent developments and outlook Sovereign Bond Yields The yields on Ethiopias sole internationally traded sovereign bond maturing in 2024 had shown a steady drop in the June to September period, but subsequently rose sharply since the start of conflict in early November. Sovereign Bond Prices Prices on the bond have now fallen below par as of November, implying several percentage points of losses for bondholders. Spreads vs US Treasuries The bonds spread vs US 10-year Treasuries remains above 600 basis points, but has not risen as much as yields given the uptick in 10-year treasury yields.

EXCHANGE RATE Recent developments and outlook Exchange rate movements over the past five months have averaged 62 cents per month, and crossed 38 Birr per USD in early November 2020. After a continuous rise since July 2019, the annual rate of depreciation peaked at 28 percent in October 2020, but has since begun to show a slightly slower pace of changeof 24 percentas of November 2020.

Exchange rate developments and outlook The gap between official and parallel market rates remains around 25 percent in recent quarters. With moderating inflation and significant USD depreciation versus other global currencies in recent months both of which lessen the need for Birr depreciation, we expect 50 to 60 cents of monthly Birr adjustmentson averagefor the period ahead. This translates into year-on-year depreciation rates of around 20 percent, sufficient to fully cover anticipated rates of inflation. Accordingly, we see the exchange rate at close to 39 BirrUSD by end-December 2020 and just under 42 BirrUSD by June 2021.
