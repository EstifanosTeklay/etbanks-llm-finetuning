We put together a data pack on Ethiopias recent fiscal performance, focusing on revenue performance over the past few years including so far this year and also taking a detailed look at the composition of government spending for the current budget year. Revenue Performance Revenue performance While conventional indicators of revenue collection in Ethiopia suggest a weak performance, a closer look at the data shows significant progress registered in recent years as well as a reasonably good record if one takes into account untaxed portions of the economy agriculture and tax incentives granted by intent for investment promotion purposes. For this year, while import-related taxes are flat or falling as fx constraints are holding back import growth, taxes linked to domestic activity are showing strong growth and record levels of collection. o Government revenue is up from Birr 30bn ten years ago to Birr 270bn last year, a 9x jump over ten years. Growth rates in nominal terms have averaged 22 percent per year over the past ten years, while the number of tax payers has crossed 550,000 as of 2018. Specific revenue line-items with particularly strong yearly growth over the past decade include include domestic indirect taxes 28 percent annual growth, direct taxes 26, and non-tax revenue 24 see Table 1. o Ethiopias revenue-to-GDP of just 12.2 percent for FY 2017-18 is indeed low in a cross-country context, but a more appropriate measure of revenue performance is better captured by revenue to non-agricultural GDP, given that the agricultural sector remains essentially untaxed per long-standing practices. Accounting for this, revenue is around 23 percent of adjusted GDP, and much closer to the norms seen in other African countries see Tables 2 and 3. o In addition, the extent to which one large foregone revenue item tax incentives for investorsunderstates revenue figures is often not well recognized. The World Banks detailed 2016 Public Expenditure Review finds tax exemptions and incentives have cost as much as 4 to 5 percent of GDP per annum in recent years, and adding back such exemptions would yield underlying revenue ratiosall else equalof near 16-17 percent of GDP. Ethiopias Recent Fiscal Performance A Data Pack and some observations RESEARCH ANALYTICS RESEARCH ANALYTICS Disclaimer This report represents solely the views, analysis, and judgement of the Cepheus research team and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Funds Managing Partners, Advisors, or Investors. 2 o For the current 2018-19 fiscal year, six month data show just a 9 percent increase in revenue on a year-on-year basis, suggesting a slight decline in real terms inflation was 10 percent over the same period. However, a decomposition of the revenue data shows that it is import-related tax receipts that are showing a large drop a 7 decline, reflecting flatfalling imports across many categories due to fx constraints. Excluding import-related items, tax collections linked to domestic economic activity are actually up by 20 percent, suggesting robust growth in both nominal and real terms Table 4. o Finally, looking at budget-related external grants, Ethiopias record shows comparatively low reliance on such funds. In Birr terms, grants have risen from 13.1 bn to 17.9 over the past ten years, but this amounts to a decline in USD terms from USD 1.1bn to USD 0.7bn and a significant decline relative to the size of the economy from 4.1 to 0.8 percent of GDP see Table 5 . Relative to African countries at similar per capita income, Ethiopia also stands out for an unusually low grant-to-GDP ratio from a cross-country context. Taken all together, the above indicators suggest that revenue collection may not be as weak as is commonly perceived. While the full range of revenue mobilization efforts currently underway remain largely approapriateincluding efforts to expand the tax net, formalize business transactions, reduce evasion, and collect unpaid duesit is equally worth recognizing the significant progress made to date and the relatively good standing seen after accounting for exempted sectors, policy-driven tax incentives and fx-related constraints. Moreover, with respect to grants, Ethiopias budget is currently a comparatively low recipient of such inflows, and there is potentially a significant scope for increases in this line-item following the closer re-engagement with external donors over the past year. Budget expenditure Government spendingthe conventional breakdowns Per the annual budget document, government spending breakdowns are presented across four categories 1 current spending 2 capital spending 3 subsidies to regions and 4 support for MDGs. The first two itemscurrent and capital spendingare further categorized into four sub-items general services, economic services, social development and others. A breakdown on this summary budget presentation basis is presented in Table 6. Government spendingdetailed line items Based on a more detailed itemization of the Federal Budget passed by Parliament in June 2018, we present a more dis-aggregated view of this years budget that includes the allocations for the specific public agencies andor government institutions RESEARCH ANALYTICS Disclaimer This report represents solely the views, analysis, and judgement of the Cepheus research team and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the Funds Managing Partners, Advisors, or Investors. 3 involved. For easy reference, we also tabulate the top 10 general expenditure items based on this dis-aggregated budget view o From the total government expenditure of Birr 347bn as passed in the June 2018 budget, Birr 205bn are funds allocated by the federal government for current and capital expenses see breakdowns in Table 7, while the remaining Birr 142bn represents lump-sum transfers to regions and MDG allocations. o A breakdown of the Birr 205bn for the federal general budget shows the following Top 10 items see Table 8 Roads remain the single largest budget item, per the norm in recent years, receiving Birr 39bn in funds for FY 2017-18. Universities are seen to receive a nearly identical amount as roads Birr 37bn, spread out over 45 institutions, and with some of the largest recipients eg AAU getting almost Birr 2bn in annual allocations while the median size allocated to universities stands at Birr 800mn per year. Debt service comprises the third largest federal expenditure allocation, at Birr 22.5bn, with around two- thirds of this paid out to external lenders. Defense spending makes up the fourth largest recipient at Birr 15 bn, equivalent to 0.6 of current year GDP. Together with security-related allocations Birr 6.7bn, these two areas receive a combined Birr 21.7bn in funds. Three key economic sectors make up the 5th, 7th, and 10th largest budgetary recipients within the Top 10, given the following allocations for Agriculture Birr 14.0bn, Energy Birr 12.3bn, and Industry Birr 6.4. Health allocations, at Birr 10.8bn make up the 8th largest recipient within the Top 10, and the second largest social sector allocation after universitieseducation. Finally, what may be termed administrative and overhead outlays of the federal government collectively received Birr 13.7bn, or the 6th largest allocation within the Top 10. Conclusion While Ethiopias budget performance often generates weak headline numbers in certain areas e.g. revenue ratios, a closer look at the figures shows some underlying strengths and qualities. Most notably, revenue collection has shown consistent growth over the years in line with the macroeconomy and stands at a reasonable share of the relevant GDP, while government spending allocations and priorities have been and remain of substantially good quality, oriented as they are towards key public goods such as roads, higher education, and growth- enhancing investments in agriculture, energy, industry, and the social sectors.
