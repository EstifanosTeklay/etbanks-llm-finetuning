Ethiopias billion-dollar sovereign bond issued in December 2014 is the countrys only debt instrument trading in global capital markets. As such, the bond is the sole Ethiopian financial instrument with a credit rating from the three main global credit agencies, thus setting a floor for borrowing costs by any other potential Ethiopian issuers. Of additional interest, the bond provides a daily indicationthrough its changing prices and yieldsof global market sentiment towards Ethiopia. In this context, we review the bonds performance over the four years since its issuance and find the following o Size With only a single bond issued in 2014 and no additional issues since, Ethiopia shows among the lowest levels of Eurobond debt among African countriesin absolute and relative terms. o Rating Despite ups and downs in the macropolitical landscape, the bonds credit rating has been stable in the past four years. o Bondholders US-based mutual funds are the largest group, including well-known emerging market investors see pg 4. o Pricing and Yields The price of the bond par value of 100 has moved from a low of 82 cents to a high of 107 cents, a swing of over 30 percent between the two extremes. Moving opposite to prices, yields were lowest in January 2018 5.47 and highest in January 2016 9.68, which we trace approximately to both emerging market developments and Ethiopia-specific factors. Looking ahead, we consider three issues 1 the likely direction of the bonds yields from here on 2 the prospects of a second Eurobond issue, and 3 the possibility of other tradeable Ethiopian bond issues in the near-term. We think that yields on the sole outstanding issue will trend downwards from here on reflecting its scarcity value plus an improved balance of payments outlook and that a second Euro-bond issue is unlikely given policy preferences towards concessional loans. As for tradeable bonds by other Ethiopian issuers, this has now become a distinct possibility within the next two years given announced plans for capital markets and we expect that market-rate government securities, local corporate paper, and long-term private bank bonds would be among the first set of instruments within such a domestic bond market.

The timing of the bond issuance was favourable, with 2014 marking a year of strong global growth 3.7 percent, low global interest rates 0.5 percent, and high flows of funds into emerging markets. Ethiopia followed other African countries that had just issued bonds in the preceding years 1.5bn in 2011, 1.7bn in 2012, and 5.1bn in 2013. Per an ODI report on this topic, 2014 marked a peak year for African country bond issues with 6.5 billion issued in that year alone.1 Key features of the Ethiopian sovereign bond also known as a Eurobond are presented in Table 1. With no additional bond issues since 2014, Ethiopias outstanding stock Eurobond debt is among the lowest for African countries. In absolute terms, Ethiopias 1 billion Eurobond is the 14th largest among African countries, and appears small compared to the size of outstanding Eurobonds in some peers such as Kenya 4.8bn, Senegal 4.1bn, Zambia 3.0 bnnot to mention the largest cases such as Nigeria 8.3bn or South Africa 18.9bn. Relative to GDP, Ethiopia shows the lowest stock of Eurobond issuance in the continent after Tanzania, at just 1.4 percent of GDP versus a median Eurobond stock of 5.1 percent of GDP for other African countries. 1 See ODI Paper Sub-Saharan Africa International Sovereign Bonds of January 2015.

All three rating agencies have not changed their ratings on Ethiopia over the past four years B for Standard and Poors B1 for Moodys and B for Fitch Ratings. It is also quite notable that the rating has not changed despite many ups and downs during the past four years, including on the political side domestic unrest and instability in certain areas, two state of emergencies, a political transition in 2018 as well as on the economic side including macroeconomic adjustments and major reform initiatives in 2017 and 2018.

Ethiopias bond yields have generally moved in line with broader emerging market yields. For example, the highest yield of 9.68 percent was recorded in January 2016, at a time when EM yields were at similarly elevated levels. At the same time, the lowest yield seen for Ethiopias bond was the 5.47 percent recorded in January 2018, a period when emerging market yields were generally at multi-year lows based on the EMBI yield measure that represents an average of emerging market sovereign bonds.

After two years of declines in 2016 and 2017, Ethiopias bond yield rose from around 5.5 percent in January 2018 to near 6.9 percent by December 2018, or a jump of 1.4 percentage points. Given major political developments in 2018, part of this increase might be taken as reflecting the political unrest at the start of the year including an active state of emergency in place till June 2018 as well as uncertainties perceived by investors regarding the transition to a new administration. However, a review of other markets suggests that the rise in Ethiopias yields actually coincides with broader emerging market trends average EM yields also rose by around 1.5-2.0 percentage points during 2018, so it appears that external factors were also significant for 2018s observed rise in yields. Indeed, during the course of the year, Ethiopias spread versus the average emerging market sovereign bond EMBI Global actually fell slightly, i.e., Ethiopias bond yield was 0.3 percentage points higher than the average EM bond in early 2018 thus suggesting it was viewed as that much riskier than its peers while its yield now is roughly the same as the average EM sovereign bond. Ethiopias latest sovereign bond yield of 6.9 percent remains broadly favarable, when seen over the four-year period since its issuance and within a cross-country context. The lastest yield remains just below the 7.1 percent average yield since the bonds issuance in December 2014, and is thus very much in line with the historical average. Compared to other issuers, the end-2018 rate of 6.9 percent is also found to be better than or similar to those of countries such as Kenya 7.9, Egypt 7.4, Namibia 7.4, Senegal 7.2, and South Africa 6.9.

Yields are likely to trend downwards over the coming year, but not by much in our view. The balance of payments outlook for 2018-19 is positive, given the likelihood for strong service export performance, rising remittances, and improved grantconcessional loan inflows. The current account deficit is also much improved in the last two years with imports down from 25 to 17 percent of GDP limiting debt sustainability risks. As long as the political environment remains relatively stable, an environment of continued strong growth and improving external position would tend to raise bond prices and reduce their yields reflecting greater willingness by investors to accept country risk for a given coupon rate. On this basis, particularly our projections for surplus in the balance of payments surplus this year, we expect yields in 2019 will revert from the high of 6.9 percent seen in late 2018 towards the lower end of the 6.0 to 6.5 percent range seen during most of 2017. With respect to the prospects for an additional Eurobond issuance, this remains quite unlikely in our view, even though Ethiopias Eurobond exposure is low compared to its peers. As highlighted earlier, Ethiopias Eurobond issuance so far is only 1 billion out of a total of about 26 billion in external debt see Table 7, and issuing say another 1 billion issue would amount to adding only around 1 percent of GDP in extra debt USD GDP is around 94 billion for the current 2018-19 fiscal year. However, despite this seemingly favorable backdrop, the debt servicing costs of a Eurobond are comparatively high, especially relative to World Bank and other concessional financing.2 Moreover, against the background of a recent rise in debt service indicators, Ethiopia is also much more focused on seeking concessional loans, such as the 1.3 billion in World Bank financing concluded in late 2018 with two similar-sized loan agreements from the World Bank are also likely over the next two years, per the World Bank loan documents. Given all of the above, we do not think a second Eurobond issuance is likely in the near-term, and especially not until exports pick up more markedly or one-off asset sales privatization proceeds, telecom license sales are arranged and completed. 2 World Bank loans on IDA terms offers a 40-year maturity, a 10 year grace period, and an interest rate of 0.75 percent. For a 1 billion loan, the annual interest due on a World Bank loan would be approximately 7.5 million in the early years vs USD 66 million for a sovereign bond issue.

Ethiopias little-known existing domestic bond market currently involves state enterprise and regional government bonds issued at low interest rates for purchase by state-owned banks these are, however, non-tradeable bonds that are held until maturity by the main buyer Commercial Bank of Ethiopia. The size of this non-tradeable domestic bond market is already quite large, at Birr 291bn as of June 2018, or equivalent to around 10.7 bn or 13 percent of GDP Table 8. Looking ahead, the existing domestic bond market is expected to be expanded by a new set of market-based issuers and instruments within the next two years, given policy announcements for the launch of capital markets by 2020. For this prospective domestic bond market, the following three groups are likely to be among the early instruments and issuers 1 market- based securities issued by the federal government to finance part of its budget deficit 2 local corporate paper by large firms and 3 long-term bonds issued by private banks. As highlighted in our 2019 Macroeconomic Handbook, these three sources couldunder certain plausible assumptions raise as much as Birr 27bn within a few years of establishment. Collectively, the size of these emerging domestic bond issues could thus match in Birr terms the size of a 1 billion sovereign bond, though of course the funding in this case would be derived from domestic savers and be secured in local rather than foreign currency terms.
