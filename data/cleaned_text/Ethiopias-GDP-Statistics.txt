Ethiopias National Planning Commission recently released the final GDP estimates for the 2019-20 fiscal year that ended in June 2020. While the headline figureof 6.1 percent real GDP growthhas been widely reported, other aspects have received less attention. We take a closer look at the underlying data, especially recent trends in key productive sub-sectors as well as in consumer spending, government consumption, and investment. We also place Ethiopias GDP data in a cross-country context that includes Africas largest economies and emerging markets. Finally, we present some simple illustrative extrapolations of where GDP and per capita income levels might reach over a 10-year and 20-year time frame. GDP and GNDI Total output produced within Ethiopia GDP reached Birr 3,374bn last year, per National Planning Commission statistics. Accounting for net transfers received from the rest of the world including remittances and grants, the total income available to residents GNDI was somewhat higher at Birr 3,574bn, or 6 above reported GDP figures. In USD terms, GDP now stands at 107bn or near 1,060 in per capita terms equivalent to 3,015 of per capita income if adjusted for purchasing power parity PPP. Growth rates Nominal GDP growth amounted to 25 percent last year, reflecting a combination of 18.2 percent inflation GDP deflator and 6.1 percent real GDP growth. Last years real GDP growth was the lowest seen in 17 years, affected in part by the COVID pandemic, though it remains among the highest rates seen globally in 2020. GDP Composition, supply-side Split by the three main productive sectors, GDP is now comprised of 37 agriculture, 24 industry, and 39 services. Seen at a more disaggregated level, the 5 largest sub-sectors are crops 25, Construction 17.8, wholesaleretail trade 14, animal husbandry 9.5, and real estate and renting 4.9. Looking at trends over the past decade, the construction sub-sector showed the largest jump in its share of GDP, rising from 4 to 21 percent of total output by contrast, the crop sector fell from 31 percent of GDP a decade ago to 21 percent today. GDP Composition, demand-side Private consumer spending, at 70 percent of GDP, accounts for the largest share of expenditure within the economy. The second largest use of funds, investment, has recently fallen as a share of GDP recent years, but this has had the effect of boosting private consumption, which is now Birr 2.4 trillion or 75bn. Cross-country context Ethiopias USD GDP is now 3rd largest in Sub-Saharan Africa, 6th largest in Africa, and 62nd largest globally while Ethiopias population stands at 12th largest globally. Ethiopias consumer spending of 75bn is 6th largest in Africa. Outlook Some simple extrapolations for the next 10 years suggest a USD GDP of 200bn under a scenario with annual average 8 GDP growth, 8 inflation, and 8 depreciation. Per capita incomes in this case would reach 1,600 5,500 in PPP terms in 2030. A low-case scenario with 5 percent growth shows per capita incomes at 1,300 4,400 PPP by 2030, while a high-case scenario with sustained 10 percent growth brings GDP per capita to 2,400 8,000 PPP by 2030.

In USD terms, nominal GDP now stands at 107bn, which is up roughly 3x in the last decade and 10x over the past 15 years Ethiopias nominal GDP in dollar terms was just 10bn as recently as 2004. Using a population estimate of 101 million CSAs medium-variant estimation for 2020, per capita income comes to near 1,060, equivalent to 3,015 on a PPP basis i.e., after accounting purchasing power parity considerations.

Over the past decade, average annual GDP growth was 9.7 percent. Compared to growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopias growth has on average been 3-times higher over the past decade. Nominal GDP grew by 25 percent last year, essentially identical to 10-year average nominal GDP growth. This large growth in nominal GDP helps moderate increases in debt-to-GDP ratios, but it has also made it harder to see improvements in tax-to-GDP ratios 10 and in broad money-to-GDP ratios 30 over the past decade. Excluding last year, annual average growth for services and industry mainly construction has exceeded 10 percent for the past decade. For agriculture, annual average growth was 5.3 percent in the past decade.

Per NPC classifications, the industry category includes manufacturing, mining, and construction. Seen from the expenditure side of GDP and taking a decade-long view, private consumption averaged close to 70 of GDP over the past decade and investment 35 of GDP. In recent years, however, investment has trended downward to 31 of GDP last year and private consumption moved slightly upwards from 66 to 70 GDP.

Reflecting the cumulative impact of the varied growth rates across sectors, the composition of GDP has shifted markedly over past decade, with the construction sector showing the biggest increase up from 4 to 21 of overall GDP, while the crop sector has declined from 31 to 21 of overall GDP during the same period. Manufacturing remains a small 4.8 percent of GDP, though this is up from 2.6 percent of GDP a decade ago.

Investment-to-GDP ratios have trended down recently, but nonetheless rose in nominal terms. As of last year, the total value of investment in the economy was Birr 1 trillion, equivalent to 33bn in dollar terms this includes the public and private components of investment as well as both domestic and foreign investors.

Taking the estimated urban share of private consumption together with the composition of spending seen in the urban consumer price index gives approximate magnitudes for the market size of major goods and services sold and consumed within urban Ethiopia. On this basis, the yearly purchasing power of Ethiopias urban population is seen to be approximately Birr 500bn or 16bn, consisting mainly of food items 6.6bn, various local services 4.4bn, and housing expenses and furnishings 3.8bn.

Ethiopias GDP level is now 3rd largest in Sub-Saharan African, behind only Nigeria and South Africa. Including North African countries, Ethiopia stands at 6th place, following Egypt, Algeria, and Morocco. Compared SSAs largest economies, Ethiopias GDP is roughly one-third that of South Africa and one-fourth that of Nigeria though USD GDP figures for those two countries are partly distorted by their volatile exchange rates.

Ethiopias GDP is roughly 1138 that of China, 124 that of India, 113 that of Brazil, and 16 that of Turkey, and 13 that of Vietnam.

Ethiopias per capita income was just 22 percent of the African average in the year 2000 when per capita income was 131 but now stands at 68 percent of the African average. Versus the global average per capita income level, Ethiopias standing has improved from just 2 percent in 2000 to around 10 percent as of last year.

Under this scenario, GDP would rise further to 433bn by 2040. Under a low-case scenario where long-term growth averages only 5 percent with annual inflation and depreciation kept at 8, GDP reaches only 160bn over the coming decade and per capita incomes 1,300. Considering a high-case scenario, involving stronger growth and somewhat reduced depreciation if balance of payments conditions improve enough to allow this, aggregate GDP could reach near 300bn in ten years. Per capita income under this higher growth case scenario surpasses 2,000 ,8000 PPP in ten years time.

time series from 2015-16 to 2019-20. Earlier GDP data use a different base year and thus not strictly comparable thus series breaks between FY 2014-15 and 2015-16.
