THE STRUCTURE AND PERFORMANCE OF ETHIOPIAS FINANCIAL SECTOR IN THE PRE AND POST REFORM PERIOD WITH SPECIAL FOCUS ON BANKING Alemayehu Geda Department of Economics, Addis Ababa University 4. INTRODUCTION 1.1. Brief Overview One of the main objectives of financial institutions is mobilizing resources in particular domestic saving and channeling them to the would-be investors. This intermediation role of financial institutions takes different forms in different economic systems. Ethiopia's history of the last three decades clearly shows the validity of this statement. Under State Socialism 1974 to 1991 financial institutions were basically executing the economic plans outlined by the central planning organ. In such set-up regulation and supervision were not critical since the national plan was believed to regulate and direct the activities of the financial institutions. Moreover, financial institutions were directed to finance some public projects that may not pass proper financial appraisal simply based on either ideological ground or merit wants argument. Such a system was running in Ethiopia until 1991 that witnessed the overthrow the Socialist State. In terms of economic policy 1991 witnessed a marked departure from the previous Socialist System, popularly referred in Ethiopia as the Derge Regime. Its difference lies on openly adopting a market-oriented economic policy. In fact much of the policies adopted by the new government in Addis in 1991 has been proposed by the Derge regime virtually at the end of its reign. In terms of the financial sector this new change in policy requires an enormous change in its activity. Not only it is going to serve the private sector, which hitherto had been demonized, but also new private financial institutions were emerging. Equally the role of the Ethiopia's central bank named National Bank of Ethiopia, NBE henceforth needs to be reformulated again. Thus, financial sector reconstruction was the top item in the government's agenda. An Amharic term meaning the committee of solders. Alemayehu Geda In undertaking this task the Ethiopian government adopted a strategy of a gradualism gradual opening up of private banks and insurance companies alongside the public ones, gradual liberalization of the foreign exchange market etc and b strengthening domestic competitive capacity before full liberalization restrict the sector to domestic investor, strengthening the regulatory and supervision capacity of the NBE, providing autonomy to banks as well as opening up inter-bank money market etc. In line with this strategy various proclamations and regulations were passed since 1992. In this study an attempt to understand this transitions will be made The rest of the paper is organized as follows. This section will conclude after a brief overview of recent macro trends in section1.2, banking history in Ethiopia in section 1.3 is made. Section will be devoted to the analysis of the financial sector in the pre and post reform periods. 1.2. Recent Macroeconomic Trends A Brief Observation As a predominantly agriculture based economy where agriculture employs more than 85 of the population and contributing nearly half to GDP, the economic performance in Ethiopia is largely determined by what happens.in the agricultural sector. Table 1.2 shows some of the main macroeconomic aggregates in recent past. As can be read from Table 1.2 the GDP growth is quite erratic. This.is the direct result of the extreme dependence of the Ethiopian economy on rain-feed agriculture. The GDP registers the highest figure when there is good rain and, the lowest sometimes negative when it is not. However, other sectors performed relatively well. For instance if we take the year 199798 the industrial sector grew by 10, the distributive sector trade, transport etc by 8.2 and other services bank, insurance, public administration and social service grew by 7.9. Thus, total. GDP grew only by 0.5 percent owing to the poor performance in the agricultural sector which has declined by 7.6 See MEDaC, 1998. Price levels are very stable in Ethiopia. In the pre-reform period. this is partly attributed to the regulated nature of market prices. The post-reform period price Stability, which was a one digit figure as can be read from Table 1.2, is attributed chiefly to conservative monetary and fiscal policy and the performance of the agricultural sector. The latte was particularly important, as the food item weight in the CPI is nearly 50. Obviously there are exception such as the year 199091 when there was a change of government and general disruption in economic activity and years such as 1994 where there was poor harvest. Ethiopia had a fixed exchange rate of Birr 2.07US for nearly two decades before the 1992 reform. At the beginning of the reform period it devalued its currency to 5 BirrUS and subsequently introduced an auction-based exchange rate system. This is a clear indication of the government's policy of gradualism. Since the introduction 134 The Structure and Performance of Ethiopias Financial Sector of the auction-based exchange rate system in 1993 discussed at length in section 4.3 below, the foreign exchange market is showing a remarkable stability. Table 1.2 shows that the premium between the auction based exchange rate which is the Official rate and that of the parallel. unofficial or illegal market rate is increasingly declining. These annual figures actually hide a lot of details. However, a more elaborated data shows that there are periods of even an alignment between the two rates. In its external sector the balance of trade is worsening owing to the growth in imports which is way ahead of the growth in exports as can be read form Table 1.2. This obviously had adverse effect on the balance of payment and the level of debt. Although the debt data in the country is quite unreliable different source give different values, the debt GNP ratio which doesnt include the ruble denominated Russian debt which is estimated to be closer to US 4 billion shows an alarming figure. 1.3. Brief Banking History One can trace the history of using modern money in Ethiopia to more than 2000 years Pankhrust in Belay, 1990. This had flourished in what is called the Axumite era which can stretch from 1000BC to around 975 AD. Leaving that long history aside, modern banking in Ethiopia started in 1905 with the establishment of Abysinian Bank based on a 50 years agreement with the Anglo-Egyptian National Bank. On top of this, in 1908 a new development bank named Societe Nationale d'Ethiope Pour le Development de Agriculture et du Commerce and two other foreign banks Banque de I'Indochine and the Compagnie de Afrique Oreintale were also established Pankhrust 1968 cited in Befekadu, 1995. These banks were criticized for being wholly foreign owned. In 1931 the Ethiopian government purchased the Abysinian Bank, which was the dominant bank, and renamed it the Bank of Ethiopia the first nationally owned bank on African continent Belay, 1990 83 Befekadu, 1995 234. During the five-years of Italian occupation there was an expansion of banking activity. In particular the Italian banks were active. Table 1.3a shows banks that were in operation during this period. . After independence from Italys brief occupation of 1933-1941 where the role of British was paramount owing to its strategic consideration in World War II, Barclays bank had established and was in business in Ethiopia from 1941 to 1943 See Belay 1990 Befekadu, 1995. Following this period the Ethiopian government established the State Bank of Ethiopia in 1943. The establishment of this Bank by Ethiopia was a Painful process since Britain was against it See Befekadu 1995 for an interesting neo-colonial story. This bank was operating both as commercial and central bank until 1963 when it was dissolved into todays National Bank of Ethiopia the central bank, re established in 1976 and The Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, CBE henceforth. After this period many other banks were established. Just before the 1974 revolution the following banks See Table 1.3b were in operation. 135 Alemayehu geda Are based on the new country level general CPI otherwise the Addis Ababa retail price index is used.

The commercial banks were Addis Ababa Bank, Banco di Napoli and Banco di Roma. The insurance companies were African Solidarity, Ethio- American life, Blue Nile, Ethiopian General, Imperial, Afro-Continental, Pan-African, Union, Ras, and Ethiopian Life and Rasi. The non-bank financial intermediaries were the Imperial Saving and Home Ownership Public Association and the Mortgage Corporation Befekadu, 1995 273. During the socialist regime 1974-1990 the nationalized banks were reorganized and one commercial bank the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, a National Bank recreated in 1976, two specialized banks the Agricultural and Industrial Bank renamed recently as the Development Bank of Ethiopia and Housing and Saving Bank renamed recently as the Construction and Business Bank as well as one insurance company Ethiopian Insurance Company were formed. After the 1992 reform these financial institutions are being reorganized to work on market oriented policy framework. Besides, new privately owned financial institutions are also being allowed to work along the publicly owned ones. The discussion about these financial institutions is the subject of the rest of this paper. 2. THE STRUCTURE AND PERFORMANCE OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM IN THE PREPOST REFORM PERIOD Following the Mckinnon 1973 and Sahws 1973 paradigm, financial liberalization has been high on the agenda of developing countries. The financial repression school - as it is sometimes referred to - argues that government intervention in the sector in particular through subsidized interest rate and favored credit allocation not only distorts the financial market but depresses saving and leads to inefficient investment. The policy prescription that follows is liberalization. This has been endorsed by international financial and development institutions such as the World Bank and IMF and had been high on the agenda of reform packages that came with name of Structural Adjustment Programs. Many developing countries that went through this agonizing reform process are unable to enjoy what is promised in this package in general and the financials sector prosperity in particular. Vos 1993 noted that the major factors that could explain the failure of financial liberalization in Latin America and its success in Asian developing countries such as Korea and Taiwan lies in the control and intervention by state to address structural problems without disregarding market-oriented performance criteria. Thus, for Vos gradualism and addressing some of the setbacks in the financial sector reform, such as lack of sensible prudential and supervisory capacity in place before the on set of the financial sector reform, are-crucial. 138 The Structure and Performance of Ethiopias Financial Sector 2.1. Describing the Pre-Keform Financial Sector The pre-reform period here refers to the period 1974 to 1991, which noted as the Derge regime before. During this period all private banks described in section 1.3 were nationalized. The National Bank of Ethiopia NBE was at the apex of the banking structure and was engaged in all the functions of a central bank. As noted earlier, CBE, AIDB DBE, HSB CBB were in operation. In addition to-these banks, there were also two other financial institutions Ethiopian Insurance Corporation EIC and the Pension and Social Security Authority PSSA. As can be read from Table 1 the CBE, followed by the DBE, are the most dominant banks in the country. On the average the CBE alone comprises more than 90 of total deposit while DBEs share is 1.3, and 71 of the total loans advanced DBEs share being 16. Owing to the dominant position of these two banks, the major activities and performance of these two banks is outlined below. This will provide us with a good picture of banking activity in the country both before and after the 1992 reform. 2.1.1. The Commercial Bank of Ethiopia CBE The Commercial Bank is established in its present form by a merger of the nationalized private bank Addis Bank with that of the publicly owned commercial bank by proclamation No. 184, 1980. It is directed by a board and managed by three mangers one General and two Deputies appointed by the government. The management is supported by detailed monthly and quarterly reports of the various banks. a Mobilization of Deposit Table 2.2.1a shows the mobilization of deposit by CBE from 1988 to date. The period after 1992 is the post-reform period. The Table shows that the CBE is the dominant bank that accounts more than 90 of the total deposit mobilized in the country. This share is the highest for demand deposit followed by saving deposit. Thus, to study the CBE is basically to study the banking sector in Ethiopia. In general the deposit mobilized by CBE has been on the average 83 in the pre- reform periods and picked up to 94 in the post-reform period. In Table 2.1.1a the sharp decline in total CBEs deposit as percent of national total observed in 1997 is primarily due to the performance of the new private banks, in particular Awash and Dashen Banks. The share of the CBB and DBE has also increased. Clearly there is evolving structural shift when deposit is observed by institutions. In general the tendency is to move form a dominant public sector towards a financial structure where the role of the private sector is becoming increasingly important. On the average, during the two periods before and after the reform, demand deposit by the private sector and individuals increased from 19 to 24. The share of 139 Alemayehu Geda 4.

The share of the public enterprises and agencies declined form 43 to 35. Financial agencies share declined from 13 to 7 while the central government's share has increased from 6 to 10. In terms of saving and time deposits the private sector has the lion share more than 95 in both periods. This is attributed to the government's rule that restricts public enterprise and agencies form holding such deposit. b Outstanding Loans Tables 2.1.1b and 2.1.1c show the outstanding loans of the CBE by sectoral and institutional social disaggregation. In the pre-reform period the average outstanding loans of the CBE was the highest in the import sector 20 following by the export 17, industrial 15.7 and domestic trade 14 sectors. In the post-reform period the outstanding loans with domestic trade sector grew enormously reaching on the average more than 35. This is followed by imports 17.4, exports 14.2 and the industrial 11.8 sectors. Despite the expansion of the construction sector in the post-reform period, outstanding loan with this sector has shown a marked decline, from 15 to nearly 4 on the average. It is interesting to point out that the CBE needs to examine the problem that is being cropping up in the trade sector. Another important point in Table 2.1.1b is that outstanding loans with the government is enormously declining from an average figure of 60 in the pre-reform period to 35 in the post-reform period. This perhaps shows the discipline the government is exercising in its fiscal and monetary polices. When the outstanding loans by institutional break down is examined see Table 2.1.1 c outstanding loan to the public enterprises remained fairly stable in the post-reform and the last five years of the pre-reform period at around 20. The share of the private sector, however, has increased from 11.8 to 37. This is attributed to the on going liberalization program which resulted in the increasing exposure of the CBE to the private sector. As to the government, as noted above, CBEs outstanding loans with government has dropped by half. c Loan Collection The most important sectors from which loan collection is made are domestic trade, followed by import and exports, and the industry in the order of importance. In terms of institutional disaggregation, loan collection from the private sector was significant which constitutes nearly 40 in the pre-reform period and jumped to an average figure of nearly 65 in the post-reform period. Loan collection from the public sector had been falling steadily in the pre-reform period. This trend has also continued in the post-reform period. This shows the bad financial shape in which the public sector found itself. In which particular sector the loan collection in the public or private sector wasis important can be read from the details provided in Table 2.1.1d. 141 The Structure and Performance of Ethiopias Financial Sector cooperatives declined form 12 to 5. The share of the public enterprises and agencies declined form 43 to 35. Financial agencies share declined from 13 to 7 while the central government's share has increased from 6 to 10. In terms of saving and time deposits the private sector has the lion share more than 95 in both periods. This is attributed to the government's rule that restricts public enternrise and agencies form holding such deposit. b Outstanding Loans Tables 2.1.1b and 2.1.1c show the outstanding loans of the CBE by sectoral and institutional social disaggregation. In the pre-reform period the average outstanding loans of the CBE was the highest in the import sector 20 following by the export 17, industrial 15.7 and domestic trade 14 sectors. In the post-reform period the outstanding ioans with domestic trade sector grew enormously reaching on the average more than 35. This is followed by imports 17.4, exports 14.2 and the industrial 11.8 sectors. Despite the expansion of the construction sector in the post-reform period, outstanding loan with this sector has shown a marked decline, from 15 to nearly 4 on the average. It is interesting to point out that the CBE needs to examine the problem that is being cropping up in the trade sector. Another important point in Table 2.1.1b is that outstanding loans with the government is enormously declining from an average figure of 60 in the pre-reform period to 35 in the post-reform period. This perhaps shows the discipline the government is exercising in its fiscal and monetary polices. When the outstanding loans by institutional break down is examined see Table 2.1.1 c outstanding loan to the public enterprises remained fairly stable in the post-reform and the last five years of the pre-reform period at around 20. The share of the private sector, however, has increased from 11.8 to 37. This is attributed to the on going liberalization program which resulted in the increasing exposure of the CBE to the private sector.

In terms of institutional disaggregation, loan collection from the private sector was significant which constitutes nearly 40 in the pre-reform period and jumped to an average figure of nearly 65 in the post-reform period. Loan collection from the public sector had been falling steadily in the pre-reform period. This trend has also continued in the post-reform period. This shows the bad financial shape in which the public sector found itself. In which particular sector the loan collection in the public or private sector wasis important can be read from the details provided in Table 2.1.1d. Alemayehu Geda In general total collection has shown a marked improvement in the post-reform period. The growth figure, which was generally negative in the pre-reform period, changed to a positive one in the post-reform period. Thus, the performance of the CBE in this regard is quite commendable. This. pinpoints to the important point that existing public banks, with proper regulation and policy environment, can enormously improve their performance. Hence, privatization, as argued by IMF, is not the only solution to bring about efficiency in the banking sector. d Asset Quality Table 2.1.1e shows the quality of assets at CBE. The liquidity ratio in both periods is quite impressive - being well above the statutory requirement of 20 in ail periods. These figures show an improved performance in the post-reform period. This good quality asset of the bank can also be inferred form the loan to deposit ratio that is increasingly showing a declining percentage notwithstanding the increase in credit which in turn shows that the bank has strong resource base. By 1997 the loan to deposit ratio has the lowest figure of 60. Moreover, the post-reform period witnessed a positive development both in the ratio of non-performing assets to total assets as well as provisions to bad debt. It should be noted however that this analysis is based on officially given figures. My observation and discussion with some researchers is that non-performing loan figures need to be cautiously taken. However, the main conclusion that can be made from the analysis of the bank's asset quality as reported in the books is that the CBE has quite impressive record in this regard. One may contrast this finding with the IMFs and Banks recommendation of either privatizing or dividing the CBE. On asset quality ground there is no official justification for such policy proposal. The IMFs and Bank's argument could be on competition ground. will comeback on this issue at the end of the paper. As can be read form Table 2.1.1e, total assets of the CBE had a modest growth rate before the reform. In the post-reform period the assets of the bank has grown annually by double digit figures. In particular the unprecedented growth of nearly 50 in 199293 is clearly associated with the reform process. According to the CBEs Annual Report, this highest growth is attributed to growth in net loans and advances, customers liability for Letter of Credit LC, cash with foreign banks and deposit with NBE in their order of importance. In particular loans and advance in 199293 increased by nearly 125 percentage points constituting nearly 25 of the total assets of the bank, for the first time in two decades. This is attributed to the growing demand for credit and hence to satisfy that demand owing to liberalization. The availability of foreign exchange and the devaluation that took place at this period devaluation by 240 has also contributed to the growth. Throughout the subsequent years loans and advances to the private sector has shown sustained increment. 2 There are unconfirmed reports that put this figure as high as 40 in the last four to five years and now currently dropping close to 15. 142 The Structure and Performance of Ethiopias Financial Sector In sum, the CBE is the dominant bank in the country. Both the quality and structure of assets and various performance indicators of the bank show that the bank is by and large in a good shape. There are certain areas such as non-performing assets where the CBE need to work hard. Even on the issue of non-performing loans the bank is moving in the right direction. The relevant policy prescription seems to intensify the on going restructuring and accompany that by prudential regulations. It seems extremely difficult, unlike that of the World Bank and IMF, to extract a policy prescription of privatization from an examination of the existing data. 2.1.2. The Development Bank of Ethiopia DBE The mobilization of deposit by DBE was fairly stagnant in the five years period before the reform. However, it dropped sharply just before the reform period and the first two years of the post-reform period. Currently its level is picking up and reaching the level registered in the pre-reform period. In terms of sectors a good share of the loan goes to the agricultural sector. In terms of loan by social sectors, Table 2.1.2 a shows that the bias against the private sector that was witnessed in the pre-reform period is reversed in the post-reform period. This reversal shows the success of redirecting the emphasis from public to private sector. In terms of loan collection, the performance of DBE is not impressive see Table 2.1.2 b. However, in the post-reform period the DBE has made a good effort to collect its. outstanding loans, in particular, from the cooperative and private sectors. Outstanding loan was a serious problem in the pre-reform period. This problem has eased in the post-reform period although currently its value is becoming close to 2 billion Birr. A good part of this outstanding loan is with the public and private sectors. The rather recent phenomenon of high level of outstanding loan with private sector needs closer attention. Although couldn't find complete data on arrears, the level of arrears in the pre-reform period in particular in the agricultural sectors where the role of state farms was crucial had reached an alarming level see Table 2.1.2d. The arrears which were on the average above 75 of total principal outstanding in the pre-reform period has declined sharply to nearly 40 in the first two years of the post-reform period owing to the rescue effort by the government. Other performance indicators of the DBE were not impressive. Table 2.1.2e shows that for the entire period the DBE is operating at loss and had a bad financial shape, as can be read from the change in working capital. Its total asset was by and large stagnant in the pre-reform period and declined thereafter. In general since the DBE was operating under the auspices of central planning and relatively exposed to loss making sectors such as state farms its performance epitomized the inefficiency of public sector. This should be contrasted with CBE, which is a public sector, but relatively performed good even on financial ground. Thus, it makes sense to make the interesting conclusion that probably what matters most is not ownership but exposure to loss making clients or not. 143 Alemayehu Geda ie eRe a g Saal ara A SOLNea "Annual Reports Of CBE, various years.

THE POLICY REGIME IN THE PRE-REFORM FINANCIAL SECTOR FINANCIAL SECTOR AND IDEOLOGY The regime that was in power from 1974-1991 can be characterized as a controlled regime where all economic activities were to be carried based on the directives that came from the central national planning organ. To facilitate this, the NBE is reorganized, as noted in section 1.3 above, by the 1976 reorganization proclamation where the role of NBE as a developmental organ is clearly emphasized by the famous article 6 in the proclamation, which expressed the objective of NBE as to foster balanced and accelerated development .... In this period, the NBE was actively involved in direct controlling of all financial institutions by a fixing both deposit and lending interest rates, b directly controlling the foreign exchange and credit allocation in a discriminatory manner, by favoring the public sector, and c by directly financing government deficit NBE, 1998. Bank supervisionregulation has been largely limited to on and off inspection on a few number of branches. The pre-reform period 1974-91 is characterized by an economic policy largely informed by the ideology of socialism. The sin qua non of such set-up is the prominent role accorded to the socialized public sector included sectors by discriminating against the private sector. During this time indirect ways of regulating the financial sector was not important since it can be controlled directly. The most important financial instruments used to directly control the sector were 1 interest rate and 2 discriminatory allocation of foreign exchange and credit. The interest rate is deliberately set at a very low level repressed and depending on the degree of socialization, different sectors did face different interest rates. The ruling interest rates for each sector in both pre and post reform periods are given in Tables 3a to c. Like that of the interest rate policy the socialized sectors were accorded priority in credit as well as foreign exchange allocation. All foreign exchange earning were surrendered to the NBE. The latter will ration this limited supply of foreign exchange 152 The Structure and Performance of Ethiopias Financial Sector to sectors that were accorded priority in the national plan. In general the priority is for the socialized sectors - the private sector being the least preferred. Similarly, credit allocation was informed by the same ideological considerations. In consultation with the Ministry of Finance and the Planning Ministry, the NBE projects the financial planning of the economy. It identifies the financial needs of different sectors through surveys and data obtained form credit institutions. Based on such information it determines the distribution of credit favoring priority investments and aiming at keeping internal and external purchasing power of the national currency unaltered. In credit allocation financial institutions used credit policy as a factor of strengthening and expanding the socialized sector and encouraging the socialization of others See Antonio, 1988 71-72. This favoring of the socialized sector is shown by the fact that a good part of the banks resources were directed to the socialized sector for instance 68 of ADB resources were allocated to State farms and that the state farms and cooperatives were not required collateral security when granted loans Ibid., 74. As noted by Antonio 1988, this restrictive policy has resulted in excess liquidity in the banking sectors in the 1980 chiefly because of a the biased credit policy, b the collateral requirement on the private sector, c seasonal trends and the then existing economic condition as well as d the CBEs inefficiency. The latter two factors are identified by a Liquidity Appraisal Committee set by CBE to understand the excess liquidity problem See Antonio, 1988 80. Table 3.1.2.

THE STRUCTURE OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM IN THE POST-REFORM PERIOD 4.1. The New Financial Sector Proclamation No. 841994 that allows the private sector owners have to be Ethiopian nationals, however to engage in the banking and insurance businesses marks the beginning of a new financial sector in Ethiopia. Following this proclamation the country witnessed a proliferation of private financial institutions. Today there are 5 new private banks and 8 insurance companies in operation. This took place in a matter of 4 years. Table 4.1 shows the list of these financial institutions. Table 4.1.

Performance of the New Private Banks Despite the proliferation of such privately owned companies, their relative share is extremely small. This can be read from the Tables given in this section. The performance of the new banks can be inferred from their relative role in deposit mobilization and disbursement of loans credit. Table 4.2a shows the percentage share of banks both in the mobilization of deposit saving and disbursement of credit. The actual values of the deposit and loans.in a rather disaggregated form are given on Table 4.2b and Table 4.2c. Table 4.2a basically Shows the dominant position of the CBE. It also shows that this dominant position has a declining trend, small by small leaving its place to the emerging private 155 The Structure and Performance of Ethiopias Financial Sector banks. The tables also reveal the relatively less significant role of time deposit. Similar pattern is observed in terms of disbursement of loans. However, the private banks are catching up relatively faster in this frontier. The disaggregation of the disbursed credit by institutional category also shows the increasing role of the private sector that can chiefly be attributed to the on going liberalization. Tables 4.2b and c provide a rather detailed picture of the summary lable discussed above. Table 4.2a revealed the increasing importance of only one of the public banks-the CBE. The Table also shows a very high level of growth in mobilization of deposit by the emerging private banks. Similar trend can be read from the data on disbursement of credit given on Table 4.2c. We already noted in Table 4.2a that the CBE has dominant position in this regard and that the private banks are catching up quickly. Table 4.2c shows which of the private banks are playing the leading role in this regard. Accordingly, the most important private banks are the Awash International Bank followed by Abyssinia and Dashen Banks. In fact the share of Awash International Bank is even larger than one of the public banks CBB. Clearly the trend of the existing data shows that the share of the private banks both in deposit mobilization and lending could increase significantly in the years ahead. It is also worth noting in Table 4.2c that the share of credit extended to the private sector has jumped from 72 to 84 in the last three years while that of the public sector's share has declined from 15 to 3.6 the share of cooperatives remaining fairly stable. This is a clear demonstration of the impact of the liberalization scheme pursued by the government. Table 4.2a. Percentage Source MEDaC 1998.

Other Financial Liberalization Schemes Two other important liberalization schemes pursued by the Ethiopian government in the post-reform period are a the exchange rate policy and b the inter-bank money market. As discussed in section three above, the pre-reform period was characterized by discriminatory interest rate, foreign exchange as well as credit allocation policies. Currently the interest rate is fairly liberalized and the NBE has set only a floor for deposit rate, leaving all other rates to be determined by market forces. Banks are now allowed to set any rate within that range. Moreover, pursuant to the strategy of gradualism, the NBE has implemented this policy step-by step. The latest interest rate policy is given on Table 3.2.1c in section three. a The Exchange Rate Policy A related policy of regulation adopted by the government is the introduction of the auction-based exchange rate determination scheme and the introduction the inter- bank money market. Again the principle of gradualism is at the heart of this policy development. The exchange rate reform is commenced by devaluing the currency that was fixed nearly for two decades at Birr 2.07 per 1 USD by 140, to 5 Birr per US in October 4992. Such massive devaluation was partly justified by the premium on the parallel market that was close to 238. In 1993 the NBE introduced the auction-based exchange rate system. This was used to be conducted on fortnight basis and takes the form of the Dutch Auction system discriminatory price, where the marginal rate, which clears the market, is taken as the ruling rate for the coming two weeks. The supply of funds for this market comes from export earnings and loans grants. The auction-based exchange rate system was initially working side by side with the official exchange rate. The system has been overseen by committee composed of the NBE, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economic Development and External Cooperation MEDaC and two representatives of the private sector. In the course of its implementation more liberalization efforts such as reducing the bid cover requirement, abolishing of negative import list, the ceiling on demand for foreign exchange etc were made. Moreover, after the 86" auction in July 1996, the NBE introduced a weekly auction replacing the previous auction which used to be held on fortnight basis. By August 1995 the official or fixed exchange rate that was used for importation of fertilizer, petroleum and pharmaceutical products as well as Ethiopias contribution to international organization and external debt-service payments is also unified with the auction rate Table 4.3.2 below shows the evolution of the official, the parallel and the auction rates. Moreover, the NBE has also replaced the retail auction system by a wholesale auction system where banks are taken as wholesale bidders This issue is discussed below. 158 Alemayehu Geda b The Inter-Bank Foreign Exchange and Money Markets The NBE has issued directives aimed at establishing inter-bank foreign exchange and money markets Directives No. IBM011998 and IBM021998, and other related documents. The establishment of this market is primarily motivated by the recognition that the foreign exchange supply by NBE through the auction system is not sufficient to satisfy the demand of banks. The inter-bank foreign exchange market IBFEM is a wholesale market, where the amount traded is large and the spread-between buying and selling rates is narrower than the norms for commercial transaction. It is an exclusive market for banks to trade foreign exchange with each other NBE Directive No. 1BM011998. The directive sets various specificity of the market. For instance the minimum amount to be traded is USD 50,000, banks shall not charge each other any fees, all transaction should be conducted in strictest confidentiality etc. Banks are also required to report to the NBE about their foreign exchange operation. Thus, the NBE uses this as one instrument of regulation. It is also gradually liberalizing the market because all these functions were used to be handled by the NBE itself. A related liberalization policy pursued is the establishment of the inter-bank money market IBMM. The IBMM describes the borrowing and lending of funds between banks, micro financing institutions, and non-bank financial institutions at the interest rate that are freely determined by borrowers and lenders themselves NBE Directive No. IBM0298. The directive specifies how this market should function. For instance, transaction should be for a minimum of Birr 300,000, there are specific times at which deals and request for deal should be made, the nature of collateral required etc. The directive also requires banks to report all their activities in this market on a daily basis to NBE. The NBE uses this information to regulate and monitor the banking activity. Moreover, the NBE has also issued a code of conduct, which has an extensive regulatory content see NBE Code of conduct for IBMM. Table 4.3.1.

SOME CONCLUDING REMARKS Since 1992 Ethiopia has carried out various liberalization efforts in the financial sector as discussed in this paper. The hallmark of the strategy is gradualism. The approach is not without problems, however. International institutions, which sponsor and financially support the liberalization scheme, especially the IMF, are not satisfied with the pace at which the liberalization is being carried. This has, at times, reached at a point where the IMF has temporarily suspended its support. The various policy framework papers jointly authored by the Ethiopian government and the staffs of the two Bretton Wood institutions are quite comprehensive embracing almost all major polices. Examination of such policy framework papers reveals that a first since the on-set of the structural adjustment program in Ethiopia, the performance is by and large in line with the target set in document. There are occasional years where the performance is both above and below the target. The latter is highly correlated with the weather condition. Second b, when we compare the time schedule set in the policy framework papers and the actual implementation of policies, the Ethiopian government is behind the schedule in many instances. However, it is interesting to note that this by and large had not led to disagreement between IMF and Ethiopia. There are occasions when the IMF suspended its help. However, an examination of the time schedule set in the policy matrix of various policy ramework papers and the performance of Ethiopia reveals that if this is the sole cause of disagreement, the IMF should have suspended the program long a go. This obviously points to possibility of having other explanations that may lurk behind the screen. An informed guess points to at least the following areas of disagreement. First, the World Bank and IMF might have disagreement with the Ethiopian government's strategy of gradualism. Second, the Ethiopian government's implicit belief in pragmatic mix between the public and private sector might have been unacceptable to IMF and World Bank and, third the IMFs and Banks insistences on the need for competition by doing something about the alleged monopoly position of the CBE is cautiously seen by Ethiopia. The last point is quite sensitive because Ethiopia may not be in a good shape to compete in the future if it does something about the supposed monopoly power of CBE and allow foreign banks to come at the same time. Moreover, the performance of the CBE doesn't warrant its privatization even unrealistically assuming that privatization is a panacea for such problems. In general, it is my opinion that given the recent nascent level of development in using market mechanisms in the country, given the relatively good shape in which the existing financial institutions find themselves, given that supervision and regulation activity of NBE is new and characterized by low level of capacity in terms of human resource, the government's strategy of gradualism and its over all reform direction need to be appreciated and be supported by World Bank, IMF and relevant institutions. 161 The Structure and Performance of Ethiopias Financial Sector REFERENCE Alemayehu Geda 1999 A Consistent Macro Database of Ethiopia Background Paper Prepared for Ethiopian Economic Association, Addis Ababa.
