EXECUTIVE SUMMARY EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The National Bank of Ethiopia NBE presents the inaugural Financial Stability Report 20231 in accordance with its responsibility to uphold a sound ﬁnancial system in Ethiopia. The report aims to address risks and promote ﬁnancial stability in Ethiopia by examining progress and challenges in the countrys economy and in the ﬁnancial sector in particular during the post-COVID-19 recovery phase. The report examines external developments and risks to the economy and the ﬁnancial sector posed by the war in Ukraine and global monetary tightening. It also highlights domestic factors, including the potential impacts of droughts and conﬂicts in parts of Ethiopia, risks emanating from the ﬁnancial industry structure, and the limitations and contributions of ﬁnancial sector infrastructure to the stability of the ﬁnancial sector. Since the stability of Ethiopias ﬁnancial system essentially depends on the health of the banking system, which accounted for 96.1 percent of the ﬁnancial sectors total assets at the end of June 2023, this report provides a particularly detailed analysis of the stability of and risks for the banking sector. According to the latest forecast by the International Monetary Fund IMF, the Ethiopian economy grew by 6.1 percent in 2023 and is expected to grow by 6.2 percent in 2024. The growth will be supported by further liberalization, the peace dividend, and the rebounding tourism industry. Moreover, aided by NBEs limits on bank credit growth and direct advances to the government, inﬂation is projected to fall to 20.7 percent in 2024. Likewise, due to an anticipated rise in government revenue as a result of improvements in domestic resource mobilization, implementation of the ﬁscal consolidation strategy, and resumption of the inﬂux of donor funds, the IMF expects the budget deﬁcit to decrease to 2.5 percent of gross domestic product GDP in 2024. With the expected expansion of exports of goods and services, it also estimates that the current account deﬁcit will decrease to 2.0 percent of GDP. Headwinds include drought in some parts of the country, debt vulnerabilities, and the efects of the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. A macroprudential risk assessment is crucial since Ethiopia's ﬁnancial institutions may indirectly be impacted by global economic slowdown. In East Africa, including Ethiopia, high food prices have afected food security and raised inﬂation, foreign exchange risk and the interest rate risk of ﬁnancial institutions. Risks to the stability 1 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA The Report is based on ofcial data for Ethiopias ﬁscal year up to the end of June 2023 and incorporates, where appropriate, IMF data up to October 2023. 1 of the Ethiopian ﬁnancial sector are likely to increase due to geopolitical tensions, Russia-Ukrainian war in Europe and the Middle East, tighter global monetary policy aimed at reducing inﬂation in developed nations, capital outﬂows from emerging and developing economies, high levels of inﬂation, and domestic vulnerabilities resulting from conﬂicts and droughts. Nonetheless, Ethiopias ﬁnancial sector continues to be stable and resilient to the fallout from COVID-19 and other new threats. Notwithstanding the increase in credit, liquidity and operational risks as well as, to a lesser degree, market risk, banks remain sound and stable due to their strong capital and liquidity bufers, solid proﬁtability, and other factors. As indicated by risk stress tests performed by NBE, these elements also contribute to the resilience of banks to shocks. In the microﬁnance sector, the capital adequacy ratio, non-performing loan NPL ratio, and liquidity ratio are all well within NBEs parameters and have improved over the course of the 2023 review period. The capital goods ﬁnance business sectors risk rating is moderate, with low capital risk and moderate ratings for asset quality and systemic risk. On the other hand, while the insurance sector remains resilient, earning and concentration risks are rated high and may call for regulatory actions. Tighter regulatory standards on credit and deposit concentration risks are necessary, as indicated by the high concentration of loans and deposits. NBE intends to mitigate market risks by implementing prudent measures and enhancing governance standards and practices. These measures will address the signiﬁcant open foreign exchange position and the discrepancy between the proportion of ﬁxed rate assets and variable rate deposits. The ﬁnancial infrastructure is developing but is still nascent. It requires further improvements in structural, operational, and technical efciencies. A more reﬁned and explicit standard for robust risk measurement in keeping with the rapidly evolving landscape of digital ﬁnancing technologies is needed. Overall, policymakers, regulators and authorities have put in place the necessary policy measures. With market players and other stakeholders, they stand ready to do more to mitigate potential vulnerabilities and ensure macroeconomic and ﬁnancial stability in Ethiopia. 2 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA 1. INTRODUCTION 1. INTRODUCTION This 2023 Financial Stability Report is the ﬁrst ever such report produced by NBE in line with its mandate to maintain a healthy ﬁnancial system.2 The report discusses developments and risks in Ethiopias economy in general and in the ﬁnancial sector in particular in the post COVID-19 recovery phase, and details how the ﬁnancial sector has remained resilient. It examines external developments and risks to the economy and ﬁnancial sector stability posed by the war in Ukraine and the global monetary policy tightening to stem rising inﬂation. The report also highlights domestic issues such as the potential impact of droughts and conﬂicts in various parts of Ethiopia, and the limitations of the ﬁnancial sector infrastructure and its contribution to the ﬁnancial sectors stability. It outlines recent policy and legal developments as well as new product and services that are expected to enhance ﬁnancial stability in 20192023. The Report is based on ofcial data for Ethiopias ﬁscal year up to the end of June 2023 3 at end-June 2023 and incorporates, where appropriate, IMF data released in October 2023. The stability of Ethiopias ﬁnancial system is afected by multiple factors. These include the structure and operation of the ﬁnancial sector and its sub-sectors, the ﬁnancial system infrastructure, and factors related with the real sectors. The following main chapters of the report address each of these three groups of factors. Following the Introduction, Chapter 2 addresses developments in recent years and projected developments both in the global economy and the Ethiopian economy, drawing conclusions on how these developments constitute risks or stabilizing factors for Ethiopias ﬁnancial system. Chapter 3 analyzes Ethiopias ﬁnancial sector and its subsectors, identifying inherent risks for systemic stability. Chapter 4 analyzes the ﬁnancial system infrastructure and related policy developments. Going forward, NBE intends to publish Financial Stability Reports annually. See Article 4 of Proclamation No. 5912008. Ethiopias ﬁscal year starts on the 8th of July and ends on the 7th of July, but this report bases its analyses on data up to the 30th of June of each year. 2 3 4 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA Date sesce tes SPS TTSTITS TI STA. 8 SSSAPSS yt SSCP ee UA, PALL SEASAEANAS Sy N LL S A Sat a PW ASL SS Oy Tyrer Se ee 2. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS 2. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS 2. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS The IMFs most recent projections, released in October 2023, predict a decrease in global economic growth from 3.5 percent in 2022 to 3.0 percent in 2023 and 2.9 percent in 2024. Economic activity has not yet returned to its pre-pandemic levels of growth. Advanced economies are anticipated to experience a decline in growth from 2.6 percent in 2022 to 1.5 percent in 2023 and 1.4 percent in 2024, with the US showing stronger momentum than expected but growth in the euro area falling short of expectations. Growth in emerging markets and developing economies is projected to decrease slightly from 4.1 percent in 2022 to 4.0 percent in 2023 and 2024 due to the crisis in the property sector in China Figure 1. In Sub-Saharan Africa, growth is expected to decline from 4.0 percent in 2022 to 3.3 percent in 2023 and is expected to recover to 4.0 percent in 2024. The projected decline for 2023 is associated, in a number of cases, with worsening weather shocks, global economic slowdown, and domestic supply issues. Growth in Nigeria is projected to decelerate from 3.3 percent in 2022 to 2.9 percent in 2023, reﬂecting weaker oil and gas production than expected, partially as a result of maintenance work. In South Africa, growth is expected to decline from 1.9 percent in 2022 to 0.9 percent in 2023, largely because of power shortages. However, Ethiopias projected growth of 6.1 percent in 2023 and 6.2 percent in 2024 is only slightly lower than in 2022 6.4 percent, positioning the country among the 20 fastest-growing economies in the world. 7 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA 2.1.

Monetary policy tightening is expected to gradually dampen inﬂation, but a central driver of the disinﬂation projected for 2023 and 2024 is declining international commodity prices. With the exception of Rwanda and Uganda, which recorded 21.6 percent and 10.2 percent inﬂation in December 2022, respectively, annual inﬂation in most East African countries remained at single digits in 2022 despite the shock to commodity prices following the war in Ukraine. Ethiopia, which had previously seen double-digit inﬂation, saw a spike in December 2021 at 35.1 percent and the rate hardly changed in 2022, standing at 33.8 percent in December 2022. But it is expected to drop to 24.5 percent and 18.5 percent by the end of 2023 and 2024, respectively Figure 2. Currency ﬂuctuations in 2023 against the United States Dollar presented a mixed picture Table 1. Currencies of other developed economies showed limited ﬂuctuations against the dollar, with the Euro showing a strong performance, probably reﬂecting the larger increase in policy interest rates in the euro area than in the United States. Most currencies of emerging economies continued to depreciate by up to 10 percent. Outliers with higher depreciation above 20 percent included the Turkish Lira, the Russian Ruble, the Egyptian Pound, and the Kenyan Shilling, all of which can be explained by country-speciﬁc reasons. Emerging markets whose currencies appreciated against the Dollar were the Brazilian Real and the Moroccan Dirham. The Ethiopian Birr depreciated slowly, at 3.8 percent over 11 months. 8 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 Ethiopia Kenya Rwanda Tanzania Uganda 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Source IMF World Economic Outlook Database October 2023 Edition Projections Figure 2 Annual inﬂation rate in East African Countries, 2019-2024, December percent Interest rate developments in 2023 diverged across countries but rates mostly increased throughout the year Table 2, reﬂecting continued attempts to reduce inﬂation. For example, the European Central Bank and the Fed increased policy rates from 2.5 percent and 4.4 percent in December 2022 to 4.5 percent and 5.4 percent in November 2023, respectively. Among the BRICS, India, Russia, South Africa and other emerging economies such as Morocco and Saudi Arabia increased their policy rates Türkiye registered the highest increase, from 9.0 percent in December 2022 to 40.0 percent in November 2023 Only Brazil and China had lower policy rates at the end of November 2023 than 11 months prior. Ethiopia held its rate constant throughout the period, reﬂecting a balancing approach to keeping inﬂation at bay without stiﬂing growth. 9 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA Table 1 Performance of Selected Countries Currencies end of year Country Currency 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Nov Change 2023 Dep -App Developed economies Euro Area Euro 0.89 0.81 0.88 0.94 0.91 -2 Canada Dollar 1.31 1.29 1.29 1.36 1.36 0 Japan Yen 71.27 73.05 74.30 82.79 83.35 1 BRICS Brazil Real 4.03 5.20 5.58 5.22 4.93 -5 China Yuan 6.99 6.53 6.37 6.99 7.13 2 India Rupee 71.27 73.05 74.30 82.79 83.35 1 Russia Ruble 61.91 73.88 74.29 70.34 88.88 26 South Africa Rand 14.03 14.69 15.91 16.99 18.86 11 East Africa Ethiopia Birr 31.80 39.18 49.19 53.34 55.38 4 Kenya Units 101.34 109.17 113.14 123.37 153.15 24 Rwanda Franc 922.52 972.48 1,009.62 1,070.71 1,227.48 15 Tanzania Shilling 2,287.93 2,298.46 2,297.61 2,324.74 2,505.93 8 Uganda Shilling 3,665.21 3,650.07 3,544.41 3,715.69 3,817.26 3 Other developing economies Egypt Pound 15.99 15.68 15.66 24.69 30.89 25 Morocco Dirham 9.59 8.90 9.28 10.45 9.91 -5 Saudi Arabia Riyal 3.75 3.75 3.75 3.75 3.75 0 Türkiye Lira 5.95 7.35 12.99 18.72 28.91 54 Source IMF, International Financial Statistics for data in italics Overall, Ethiopias ﬁnancial institutions face variety of risks due to the state of the global economy, with multiple macroeconomic shocks implied by the weakening of global growth along with high food, fuel and other commodity prices. This afects Ethiopias external position by driving up import costs and stiﬂing exports. Consequently, there by raises the risks for ﬁnancial institutions in the country. Furthermore, developments in various foreign exchange markets and the trend towards higher benchmark policy interest rates could increase the foreign exchange and interest rate risks that ﬁnancial institutions face in Ethiopia. Positively, though, global growth has proven remarkably resilient against a background of rising geopolitical tensions and violent conﬂicts. In addition, the diversity of developments across economies ofers an opportunity to reduce risks by building diversiﬁed portfolios of economic relations. Domestic factors will also impact the health of the Ethiopian ﬁnancial system. According to the analysis, certain factors raise risk while others support stability and resilience. a Economic Growth Over the last ﬁve years, Ethiopia's economy has registered high growth, which is projected to continue in the coming years Figure 1. Real GDP growth at above 6.0 percent remains higher than the average growth for Sub-Saharan Africa projected at 3.3 percent for 2023 and 4.0 percent for 2024. 10 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA Source Bank for International Settlements for Ethiopia NBE.

The share of services in GDP increased slightly from 40.0 percent in 2022 to 40.3 percent in 2023 surpassing the level of 39.8 percent in 2019, and thus recovering from the contraction induced by COVID-19 Figure 3. The share of industry decreased slightly from 28.9 percent in 2022 to 28.8 percent in 2023 above the 2019 pre-COVID level, indicating a strong performance of the sector in the longer term. The share of agriculture declined steadily from 33.3 percent in 2019 to 32.1 percent in 2023. b Inﬂation Over the last two years, domestic interest rates have remained stable, despite the fact that inﬂation is still high Figure 4. Notwithstanding a number of unfavorable factors, such as droughts, inﬂation expectations, lack of foreign exchange, instability in some parts of the country, and the efect of the war in Ukraine on commodity prices, the average annual rate of inﬂation fell from 34.0 percent in 2022 to 29.3 percent in 2023. c Inﬂation and Yields The yearly weighted average yield on government T-bills was 9.7 percent in 2023, slightly up from 9.5 percent in 2022 Figure 4. The average long-term lending interest rate of the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia CBE, the largest state-owned bank, and private banks remained at 16.5 percent and 17.4 percent, respectively, in both 2022 and 2023. Global annualized headline inﬂation is set to fall from 8.9 percent in December 2022 to 6.4 percent in December 2023 and 5.1 percent in December 2014. Monetary policy tightening is expected to gradually dampen inﬂation, but a central driver of the disinﬂation projected for 2023 and 2024 is declining international commodity prices. 11 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Agriculture share of GDP Industry share of GDP Service share of GDP Real GDP Growth 33.3 32.7 32.5 32.4 32.1 28.1 29.0 29.3 28.9 28.8 39.8 39.5 39.6 40.0 40.3 10.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0 50 100 9.0 6.1 6.3 6.4 6.1 6.2 With the exception of Rwanda and Uganda, which recorded 21.6 percent and 10.2 percent in December 2022, respectively, annual inﬂation in most East African countries remained at single digits in 2022 despite the shock to commodity prices following the war in Ukraine.

Public external debt decreased from 28.2 percent of GDP in 2019 to 17.2 percent of GDP in 2023 Figure 6. In the years 2020 and 2021, Ethiopia had beneﬁted from the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative. However, Fitch and SP downgraded Ethiopia's sovereign rating from B to CCC when the country applied for the G20 Common Framework for debt restructuring in 2021. As revenue growth surpassed the increase in spending, the budget deﬁcit went down from 3.4 percent of GDP in 2022 to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2023. Similarly, the ratio of external debt service to exports dropped from 20.4 percent in 2022 to 16.5 percent in 2023. 13 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA Figure 6 Public Debt Service Repayments and Budget Balance, 2019-2024 Source NBE and projections by the African Economic Outlook team External Debt - principal and interest repayment USD-Million External Debt - stock to GDP ratio, External debt service to export ratio PERCENT Budget balance GDP 0 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 29 27 25 23 19 17 15 0 -0.5 -1 -1.5 -2 -2.5 -3 3.5 -4 2019 2020 2021 2023 2022 2019 2020 2021 2023 2023 2022 Projection Area External debt - interest payment External debt - principal repayment External debt service to export ratio External debt - stock to GDP ratio f Conclusion In general, domestic economic conditions are expected to improve in 2024. It is anticipated that the economy will grow strongly by 6.2 percent, equally driven by services, agriculture, and industry from the supply side, and by personal spending and investment from the demand side. The growth is expected to be supported by economic liberalization, the peace dividend, and a recovery of the tourism industry. Furthermore, following the peace dividend and NBEs stringent policies on bank credit growth and direct advances to the government, inﬂation is projected to fall to 20.7 percent in 2024. Likewise, due to an anticipated rise in government revenue as a result of improvements in domestic resource mobilization, implementation of the ﬁscal consolidation strategy, and the resumption of the inﬂux of donor funds, the 26.7 16.5 17.2 -2.5 -2.5 -2.8 -3.4 -2.5 -2.5 28.2 budget deﬁcit is predicted to sustain at 2.5 percent of GDP in 2024. The current account deﬁcit is anticipated to decrease to 2.0 percent of GDP in 2024 with the expected expansion of exports of goods and services. External debt service to export dropped from 20.4 percent in 2022 to 16.5 percent in 2023. On the other hand, headwinds include drought in parts of the country, debt vulnerabilities, a widening gap between the ofcial and parallel exchange rate, and the efects of the Russia-Ukraninan war in Europe and the Middle East. 14 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA 3.

FINANCIAL SECTOR STABILITY AND RISK 3. FINANCIAL SECTOR STABILITY AND RISK This chapter analyzes 4 stability and risks in the Ethiopian ﬁnancial sector across the banking, microﬁnance and capital goods ﬁnancing, and insurance sectors, which are all regulated and supervised by NBE.5 Policy actions taken by the government and the regulator remain supportive to the sectors resilience and ﬁnancial stability.6 Primary and secondary ﬁnancial markets are not yet properly established although signiﬁcant work on launching capital markets has proceeded with a new proclamation on Capital Market Authority and perparation is underway for the establisment of Ethiopian Stock Exchange in 2024. At end-June 2023, total assets of the ﬁnancial sector amounted to Birr 3,120.5 billion, 20.4 percent higher than a year earlier Table 3. These assets constituted 35.8 percent of GDP 7, compared with 42.1 percent at end-June 2022. The ﬁnancial sector continued to be dominated by the banking sector, whose total assets accounted for 96.3 percent of total ﬁnancial sector assets at end-June 2023 slightly less than a year before because of a stronger growth of the microﬁnance sector. This implies that the stability of Ethiopian ﬁnancial systemsector largely depends on the health and stability of the banking sector. As a result, the banking sector is analyzed in more detail in the following sections.

The rest are three full-ﬂedged interest-free banks, ﬁve MFIs that had graduated to commercial banks, and 22 conventional commercial banks, including the countrys largest bank, the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia CBE. Except for DBE and CBE, all are private banks. As the following sections show, the banking sector is assessed as safe, sound and stable at the end of June 2023. The banking sector is of high importance to the Ethiopian economy. Total deposits at end-June 2023 reached Birr 2.2 trillion, 24.8 percent of GDP and total loans bonds of banks amounted to Birr 1.9 trillion, 21.7 percent of GDP Table 4 and Figure 7. Total bank deposits grew by 24.6 percent, reﬂecting rapid growth in both saving and time deposits. Similarly, loans bonds grew by 24.3 percent. However, GDP increased at a faster rate. Accordingly, the share of deposits in GDP decreased from 28.2 percent of the previous year to 24.8 percent at end-June 2023, and that of loans bonds from 16.0 percent to 14.3 percent. The share of loans in GDP is low by international comparisons, and the objective is to increase it signiﬁcantly in the medium term, thereby also reducing credit concentration risk see Section 3.2.1.3 below. A related positive development in this regard is the shif in the loan portfolio. Since 2021, total credits to the private sector have exceeded loans to the public sector Figure 8. Notwithstanding droughts and conﬂicts in parts of the country, and the war in Ukraine and the associated global commodity price shock, total assets of commercial banks reached Birr 2,845.9 billion at end-June 2023 an increase of 19.9 percent from the previous year due to Ethiopias strong economic growth see Section 2.2 above,. The major contributors to total asset growth were loans advances and bonds, which together accounted for the largest share 66.4 percent of total assets. 18 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA Source NBE Database Monetary and Financial Analysis Directorate of NBE Source NBE Database 11 Net of loan loss provisions, depreciation, amortizations etc. 12 Includes NBE Bills, DBE Bonds, Government Bonds and Corporate Bonds 13 Nominal Table 4 Banks' Major Balance Sheet Items billion Birr Figure 7 Bank Assets, Loans Bonds, and Deposits, 2019-2023 PARTICULARS 062019 062020 Growth 062021 Growth 062022 Growth 062023 Growth Total Assets net 11 1,215.1 1,462.4 20.4 1,843.2 26.0 2,374.1 28.8 2,845.9 19.9 Loans Bonds 912.3 1,085.8 19.0 1,317.3 21.3 1,521.1 15.5 1,890.3 24.3 Loans and Advances net 443.6 559.0 26.0 766.9 37.2 986.7 28.7 1,247.5 26.4 Bonds 12 468.7 526.8 12.4 550.4 4.5 534.4 2.9 642.8 20.3 Total Deposits 898.9 1,041.9 15.9 1,360.1 30.5 1,735.3 27.6 2,162.2 24.6 Saving deposits 518.0 622.5 20.2 855.8 37.5 1,085.3 26.8 1,370.1 26.2 Demand deposits 316.8 356.4 12.5 439.6 23.4 567.1 29.0 679.9 19.9 Time deposits 64.1 63.1 1.6 64.7 2.5 83.0 28.3 112.2 35.2 Regulatory Capital 93.8 105.2 12.2 121.9 15.9 168.9 38.5 212.4 25.7 GDP 13 2,690.8 3,374.7 25.4 4,341.0 28.6 6,157.0 41.8 8,722.3 41.7 Share of Loans in GDP 16.5 16.6 0.1 17.7 1.1 16.0 - 1.6 14.3 - 1.7 Share of Deposits in GDP 33.4 30.9 -2.5 31.3 0.5 28.2 - 3.1 24.8 -3.4 Share of Loans Bonds in GDP 33.9 32.2 -1.7 30.3 - 1.8 24.7 - 5.6 21.7 -3.0 Share of Loans Bonds in Total Assets 75.1 74.2 -0.8 71.5 -2.8 64.1 - 7.4 66.4 2.4 0 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 Jun. 19 Jun. 20 Jun. 21 Jun. 22 Jun. 23 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 Jun. 19 Jun. 20 Jun. 21 Jun. 22 Jun. 23 A.

By reducing the likelihood of bank runs, this is expected to contribute signiﬁcantly to stability in the banking and microﬁnance sectors, and hence, to the overall ﬁnancial system. Box 1 Ethiopias Deposit Insurance Fund The Ethiopian Deposit Insurance Fund The Fund was established as per Council of Ministers Regulation No. 4822021 to serve as a ﬁnancial safety net for depositors of commercial banks and microﬁnance institutions. The Fund is an institution with a legal personality that is accountable to NBE. It is mandated to determine initial and annual premiums, set the coverage ceilings for insured money deposits which may not be more than Birr 100,000, make payments to eligible depositors up to the extent of insured deposits, recover the payments made from the liquidation proceeds of failed ﬁnancial institutions, collect premiums from member ﬁnancial institutions 14 and various contributions from other sources, and deal with parties at fault in member ﬁnancial institutions failure and manage court cases. The main objective of the Fund is to contribute to the safety, soundness, and stability of the Ethiopian Financial System. It also aims to protect depositors by introducing a deposit insurance fund. The Fund is expected to enable payments to member ﬁnancial institutions depositors with insured deposits in case of an insurance event. In doing so, it is also anticipated to mitigate risk and contribute to the stability of the ﬁnancial system. The Fund has issued a directive related to initial and annual premium contributions and managed to collect Birr 2.8 billion in 202324 Q2 in the form of initial and annual premiums, which were invested in short-term governmen securities. 14 Membership in the Fund is compulsory for banks and MFIs 20 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA 3.2.1.2 Industry Structure and Systemic Risk Of the 30 commercial banks registered before end of June 2023 in Ethiopia excluding the DBE, one is a state-owned bank three are private interest-free banks ﬁve 15 are micro-ﬁnance institutions MFIs transformed into commercial banks and the rest are conventional private commercial banks. NBE distinguishes based on asset size three types of commercial banks large, medium, and small banks. Their respective roles in the market are as follows Table 5 Large Bank The only large bank in the country that also dominates the industry is the state-owned Commercial Bank of Ethiopia CBE. At end-June 2023, its total assets and deposits constituted almost half 49.5 percent and 48.7 percent, respectively of the whole banking sector. However, its total capital accounted for just over a quarter 27.5 percent of the total. Although its market share had declined from the previous year, CBE is clearly a domestic systemically important bank. Medium-sized Banks At end-June 2023, the combined assets of the ﬁve medium-sized banks 16 accounted for 28.0 percent of the sectors total assets, slightly higher from the previous year. Their total deposits accounted for 29.4 percent of the sectors total, marginally lower than at end-June 2022. On the other hand, their entire capital was 31.0 percent of the sectors total, up from 28.8 percent of the previous year. None of these banks is currently regarded as a systemic bank, despite their growing market share. Small Banks At end-June 2023, the combined assets and deposits of the 24 small banks 17 accounted for 22.5 percent and 21.9 percent, respectively, of the whole banking sector an annual increase of 3.4 and 2.6 percentage points, respectively. Likewise, their combined total capital share increased from 40.2 percent of the sectors total capital in 2022 to 41.6 percent at end-June 2023. The growth of the small banks aggregate market share can be explained by the increase in their number two more banks had joined the banking sector and the rapid initial expansion of recently established banks. However, with an individual share in assets, deposits, and loans bonds of less than one percent, none of the small banks can be considered a systemic bank. 15 Of which, one is full-ﬂedged interest-free bank 16 Awash Bank, Bank of Abyssinia, Cooperative Bank of Oromia, Dashen Bank, Hibret Bank. 17 Abay Bank, Addis International Bank, Ahadu Bank, Amhara Bank, Berhan Bank, Bunna Bank, Enat Bank, Gadaa Bank, Global Bank, Goh Betoch Bank, Hijra Bank, Lion International Bank, Nib International Bank, Omo Bank, Oromia Bank, Rammis Bank, Shabelle Bank, Sidama Bank, Siinqee Bank, Tsedey Bank, Tsehay Bank, Wegagen Bank, ZamZam Bank, Zemen Bank. 21 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA Source NBE Database and Of-site Reports Table 5 Banking Industry Market Shares, June 2023 vs. June 2022 percent Assessment of Systemic Risk Stemming from Industry Structure As indicated above, CBE is a systemic bank in the Ethiopian banking system and can therefore entail systemic risk. Because of its relatively strong capitalization, CBE is believed to have withstood a number of recent negative domestic and external shocks, including local conﬂicts and droughts, global inﬂation, disruptions to the supply chain brought on by the war in Ukraine, changes in the price of oil and other commodities, climate change and others. Yet CBE has a high cushion of regulatory capacity as its capital adequacy ratio CAR is signiﬁcantly above NBEs 8 percent minimum capital requirement, and its liquidity position is also above the 15 percent minimum requirement. Thus, at all levels of risk stress, CBEs CAR and liquidly position will remain above the regulatory minima. However, because the majority of the banks paid-up capital is government-issued promissory bond Proclamation No. 9942017 Government Bond that has not yet been fully paid for in cash CBEs capital position requires targeted policy and regulatory attention in the event of unfavorable circumstances. Furthermore, even though the stress tests performed show that the systemic bank is resilient to credit risks see Section 3.2.1.5 below, NBE will continue to monitor the bank's exposure to loans transferred to the Liability and Asset Management Corporation. 18 Total Assets Total Loans Bonds Total Deposits Total Capital Type of bank June 2022 June 2023 June 2022 June 2023 June 2022 June 2023 June June June 2022 2023 BY SIZE CLASS Large 54.0 49.5 52.0 46.7 51.3 48.7 31.0 27.5 Medium 26.9 28.0 29.0 30.5 29.5 29.4 28.8 31.0 Small 19.1 22.5 19.1 22.9 19.3 21.9 40.2 41.6 BY OWNERSHIP Public 54.0 49.5 52.0 46.7 51.3 48.7 31.0 27.5 Private 46.0 50.5 48.0 53.4 48.7 51.3 69.0 72.6 June 18 The Liability and Asset Management Corporation was established by the Government in 2021 to manage the consolidation and servicing of a portion of the debt of the countrys state-owned enterprises SOE and other state-owned assets. 22 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA Source NBE Database Table 6 Banking Loans by Sector billion Birr 3.2.1.3 Credit Concentration Banking Industry Credit Concentration by Economic Sector Even though manufacturing continued to account for the largest share of loans and advances 23.2 percent from Ethiopian banks at end-June 2023, domestic trade and services increased in importance, expanding by 3.8 percentage points to 20.7 percent Table 6. The faster growth in loans to domestic trade and services could mean that domestic demand for credit ﬁnancing has increased as a result of the governments import substitution policy,19 and that banks are turning to domestic business as a result of issues in the global market. Compared to other sectors, the import sectors share of loans declined at a faster pace by 3.9 percentage points. Main reasons for this were unfavorable international economic conditions such as the war in Ukraine, supply chain problems, shortage of foreign exchange, and stringent NBE regulations pertaining to the surrender of foreign currency proceeds. Overall, the loan portfolio across sectors is relatively diversiﬁed. Banking Industry Credit Concentration The banking sectors loans and advances are concentrated in the hands of a few large borrowers. The top ten borrowers from the banking industry held 23.5 percent of total loans advances of the banking industry at end-June 2023, a signiﬁcantly higher share than a year earlier 18.7 percent.

Moreover, even though borrowers with an individual credit exposure of above Birr 10 million constituted only 0.5 percent of the total, they held almost three quarters 73.7 percent of the entire banking sector loans again, a higher share than the year before. Virtually all loans 99.8 percent at end-June 2023 were held by borrowers from urban areas.20 3.2.1.4 Soundness Indicators The commercial banking industry in Ethiopia is considered sound and resilient based on an assessment of ﬁnancial soundness indicators capital adequacy ratio, liquidity position, and NPLs. A. Asset Quality Indicators As a result of low NPLs and adequate provisioning for non-performing loans, the quality of assets of the Ethiopian commercial banking industry was generally sound at the end of June 2023. The ratio of NPLs to gross loans fell from 3.9 percent at end-June 2022 to 3.6 percent at end-June 2023 Figure 9, well below the regulatory maximum of 5.0 percent . Furthermore, provisioning increased from 122.9 percent of NPLs in the previous year to 132.5 percent of NPLs at end-June 2023 Figure 10, more than covering reported NPLs. These ﬁgures suggest that the industrys proﬁtability was not overstated and capital was of good quality.

Capital Adequacy Indicators The regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets ratio for the banking sector slightly fell from 16.3 percent in the previous year to 14.7 at end-June 2023, but it is still much higher than the 8.0 percent regulatory minimum Figure 11. C. Liquidity Indicators The liquid assets to deposits ratio of the banking sector decreased from 27.0 percent in the previous year to 24.2 percent at end-June 2023, but it is still much higher than the 15.0 percent regulatory minimum Figure 12. During the same period, the ratio of loans to deposits rose by 0.9 percentage points to 60.6 percent. While, the ratio of loans bonds to deposits dropped slightly to 90.3 percent. This is still very high, though, and suggests that nearly all depositors money is held by borrowers rather than being liquid assets, which could lead to a liquidity problem under unfavorable circumstances. The decrease in the liquidity ratio may have been caused by increased lending, particularly to agriculture, domestic trade and services, and households staf and consumers see Table 6 above. This is in line with the general policy that encourages lending to the key sectors of the economy. 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 0 25 20 15 10 5 CAR Threshold 19.9 18.4 15.2 16.3 14.7 25 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA Figure 12 Banking Industry Liquidity Indicators percent Source NBE Database High concentration of deposits and the diference in maturities between deposits and loans may create liquidity risk in the banking sector despite the existing high liquidity ratio. At the end of June 2023, 56.3 percent of the total banking sector deposits was held by only 0.5 percent of the total banking sector depositors. In addition, the liquid assets of banks only incorporated a small share of high-quality liquid assets cash. As a result, some banks were facing real time transaction-level liquidity shortages. This is analyzed further as part of the liquidity risk stress test in section 3.2.1.5. D. Proﬁtability Indicators Total income of the banking sector reached Birr 297.5 billion at end-June 2023, up from Birr 247.0 billion in the previous year Figure 13. Expenses grew with the expansion of activities, and the total number of bank employees rose by 26.0 percent to 187,450. Hence, net income before tax remained almost stable Birr 62.9 billion at end- June 2023, compared with Birr 61.8 billion of the previous year. The proﬁtability of the banking industry decreased but is still sufcient. Return on equity and return on assets, measures of proﬁtability, were 25.7 percent and 2.0 percent at end-June 2023, respectively. These ﬁgures were marginally lower than those of the previous year, primarily because of an increase in bank provisioning Figure 14.

Credit Risk Stress Test NBE performed a banking sector credit risk stress test at end-June 2023 for the 12 months ahead under a baseline, moderate and severe scenario. The scenarios were calibrated according to domestic and international shocks that could negatively impact the recovery and, eventually, the credit risk of the banking industry. 21 25.8 21.6 Return on Equity Return on Asset 0 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 26.7 32.6 25.7 2.1 1.7 1.9 2.4 2.0 21 A preliminary assessment had established that capital to total risk-weighted assets ratio regulatory CAR of all banks was higher than the 8.0 percent minimum statutory requirement. Thus, all banks were included in the stress test. 27 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA Table 7 Results of Credit Risk Stress Test increase in NPLs Source NBE Database and of-site reports based on data as of June 2023 The baseline scenario pre-shock anticipated that the economy will grow according to the IMF forecast, with international and domestic conditions improving, and the country free of droughts and conﬂicts. The moderate scenario assumed that NPLs in the banking industry will increase to 10.0 percent. In principle, this could happen as a result of deteriorating domestic andor external circumstances, such as drought and heightened conﬂict or an increasing foreign currency shortage. The severe scenario assumed that NPLs will increase to 30.0 percent. The credit risk stress test results Table 7 provide an assessment of banks capital erosion following asset quality impairment under moderate and severe scenarios if the unfavorable circumstances occur by end-June 2024. The results indicate that all banks have sufcient capital to withstand a moderate shock. Twelve banks would fail the stress test due to an increase in NPLs under the severe scenario, requiring additional capital equal to 1.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. Not all banks have the same requirement for capital injection. Speciﬁcally, the systemic bank and the majority of MFIs that converted to banks in the small banks class have more capital and do not require capital injections.

Liquidity Risk Stress Test The liquidity stress test considers the aggregate impact on the banking sector liquidity if the top 10 depositors in each bank suddenly withdraw all their money. The stress test results Table 8 show that the banking sector liquidity ratio would fall from 24.0 percent in the pre-shock situation based on data as of end of June 2023 to 13.0 percent slightly below the 15 percent regulatory minimum requirement. However, some of the banks would be in worse situation than the industry average. Even though the systemic bank shows resilience to the shock, 18 banks would fail to meet the regulatory minimum requirement four medium-sized banks and 14 small banks. 28 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA Table 8 Result of Liquidity Risk Stress Test withdrawal of top 10 depositors Source NBE Database and Of-site Reports These results suggest that many Ethiopian commercial banks are highly sensitive to liquidity risk from sudden withdrawals by a few big depositors. The banking industry has also become more sensitive at end-June 2023 than in the previous year. Exposed to the same shock, only six banks would have failed to meet the minimum liquidity requirements at end-June 2022. 3.2.1.6 Summary of Risk Assessment and Outlook In 20222023 the review period, the banking sector remained stable and resilient against the backdrop of a strong domestic economic growth, efective monetary and ﬁnancial policies aimed at containing the lingering impact of the COVID19 pandemic, and conﬂicts and droughts in some parts of the country. Overall, the outlook for 2024 is also positive. Underpinned by sufcient capital and proﬁtability, the sector is expected to remain stable and resilient, which is supported by the Banking Sector Risk Stress Test results performed based on end-June 2023 data. However, there are downside risks associated with potential domestic and external shocks. Credit Risk The banking industrys credit risk remained moderate during the review period but is expected to increase in 2024. Credit risk could increase because of droughts and conﬂicts in some parts of the country. Deterioration in the external sector the implication of the global monetary policy tightening on domestic interest rates, the exchange rate and capital ﬂows and the impact of the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East on trade and other transactions could increase credit risk. These risks are accentuated by the high credit borrower concentration, suggesting the need for tighter regulatory standards on credit concentration risks.

Therefore, it is imperative to follow prudent and principle-based lending and ﬁnancing practices that are in line with the banks risk strategy and appetite as well as any applicable legal requirements. In this regard, the asset quality of the banking system in Ethiopia as a whole and of most banks is found to be satisfactory as their NPL ratio is below NBEs 5 percent maximum. However, in light of the aforementioned systemic risks and the less satisfactory performance of some banks, NBE is closely monitoring banks with relatively higher NPLs in order to reduce their NPLs for them to maintain an acceptable NPL exposure and credit portfolio. Liquidity Risk Liquidity of the banking industry remained moderate and stable during the review period liquidity risk is also expected to remain moderate, albeit increasing in the short and medium terms. The banking industry is expected to maintain a robust liquidity position and resilience to short-term liquidity shocks. However, downside risks persist, including failure to meet weekly liquidity requirements, Real-Time Gross Settlement System RTGS payment requirements, asset and liability mismatches and funding gaps at the short-term maturity buckets, and high deposit concentration. The latter may suggest the need for tighter regulatory standards on deposit concentration risks. As banks mobilize short term deposit and invest same in long term assets, they normally face an asset-liability time mismatch in their books. To this end, it is critical for banks to manage their liquidity risk and maintain adequate liquidity that will enable them to proactively and efectively meet their obligations at all times. Most banks in Ethiopia comply with NBEs 15 percent minimum liquidity ratio requirement and have a proven track record of meeting payment obligations in the RTGS. NBE is closely monitoring banks with liquidity challenges and weaker liquidity risk management practices by undertaking supervisory meetings with their leaderships. It also engages with such banks to ensure that corrective and remedial actions for addressing the observed liquidity issues are implemented to prevent any negative spillovers to the overall ﬁnancial system. Going forward, NBE will take the necessary measures to ensure that banks implement sound and comprehensive liquidity management supported by adequate liquidity risk management tools including governance, limits, stress tests, contingency planning, and cash ﬂow projections, among others. 30 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA Market Risk Market risk is moderate but is increasing. In a rising interest rate environment, banks funding costs may increase since deposit liabilities are at variable rates, while a large amount of assets corporate bonds held by CBE and DBE, and treasury bonds held by private banks are at ﬁxed rate. Therefore, bank proﬁtability may deteriorate somewhat. Commercial banks overall open foreign currency position was 81.7 percent short at end-June 2023, lower than a year earlier but still well above NBEs maximum limit of 15 percent. Commercial banks have experienced ﬂuctuation in the downside open positions. The large open position was concentrated in ﬁve banks the large bank, three medium-size banks and one small bank. Market risks rise in the short-term in a continued high interest rate environment. Banks ofen have an imbalance between variable rate deposits and a large proportion of the ﬁxed rate assets they hold. NBE will put in place cautious measures to reduce these risks as well as exchange rate risks. Operational Risk There is signiﬁcant operational risk in the Ethiopian commercial banking industry and is expected to rise further in the short to medium terms. Incidents of social engineering, insider threats and third-party risks are on the rise. The cost of bank fraud and forgeries almost doubled to Birr 1.0 billion in just a year. These cases occurred at 20 banks, mainly through the use of fake cash notes and cheques, embezzlement, the issuance of unauthorized bank guarantees, withdrawals using stolen ATM cards, and false calls or texts. Moreover, robberies amounting to Birr 0.2 billion were reported by three banks at end-June 2023. Commercial banks are introducing technology-based new products and services that enhance efciency and ﬁnancial inclusion but entail signiﬁcant operational risks. Moreover, an increasing number of banks are applying to introduce digital micro credit saving services that are provided through partnerships with third parties. As a consequence, incidences of fraud and embezzlement could increase. Major policy developments need to focus on implementing regulations that outline efective strategies for measuring and mitigating operational risks. 31 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA Source Annex A 22 All data used in this analysis are provisional not audited. 3.2.2 Development Finance Institution The total assets 22 of the DBE grew by 19.8 percent from the previous year to Birr 157.8 billion at end-June 2023. The increase was largely because of the growth of loans and advances by 25.0 percent. Total regulatory capital increased by 2.8 percent from the previous years Birr 30.1 billion to Birr 31.0 billion. Deposit liabilities more than doubled, but the regulatory capital ratio fell to 30.0 percent, reﬂecting a large increase in provisioning that by the end of June 2023 more than covered NPLs. Mainly due to regulatory forbearance and enhanced loan collection, the ratio of NPLs to total loans decreased signiﬁcantly from 24.3 percent to 7.1 percent. Proﬁtability increased, with return on assets reaching 3.3 percent, and return on capital 15.5 percent Figure 15, Figure 16 and Annex A. Overall, the vulnerability of DBE to risks decreased substantially during the review period.

This section focuses on the stability and vulnerability to risks for the microﬁnance and capital goods ﬁnance business sectors. Given their share, these sectors are not expected to pose a signiﬁcant risk to Ethiopias overall ﬁnancial system. At end-June 2023, all MFIs together accounted for 2.0 percent of the ﬁnancial sectors total assets, and all Capital Goods Finance Companies for 0.2 percent see Table 3 in section 3.1 above. Therefore, the analysis in this section is limited when compared to that of the banking sector, but more details are provided in the Annexes. At end-June 2023, 47 microﬁnance institutions with a total of 1,109 branches and six Capital Goods Finance Companies 23 with a total of 55 branches were operating in Ethiopia. 3.3.1 Microﬁnance Sector24 The microﬁnance sector grew strongly in the year to end-June 2023. Total assets and deposits increased by 33.7 percent from Birr 46.1 billion to Birr 61.7 billion and 28.8 percent from Birr 21.7 billion to Birr 27.9 billion, respectively. Liquid assets and net loans also increased signiﬁcantly Table 9.

At end-June 2023 and for the ﬁrst time in ﬁve years, the NPL ratio at 4.3 percent met NBEs requirement of less than 5.0 percent Figure 18. This again indicates a low risk level for the sector. Likewise, provisions to NPLs increased to 69.7 percent, also suggesting a signiﬁcant recovery from the COVID-19 period. The composition of MFI loans by sector shifed markedly in the year to June 2023 Figure 19. Loans to agriculture decreased from 28.8 percent of total microﬁnance loans of the previous year to 18.7 percent at end-June 2023, whereas loans to the trade sector increased from 30.1 percent to 37.4 percent. Furthermore, there is a high The capital adequacy ratio, one indicator for ﬁnancial soundness, was 32.2 percent at end-June 2023, well above levels seen during COVID-19 Figure 17 and NBEs 12 percent minimum requirement. This indicates that the microﬁnance sector has a low and stable risk level as it has sufcient capital on reserve to manage adverse ﬁnancial shocks.

Finally, the microﬁnance sector has met its liquidity requirements but remains highly interconnected with and reliant on commercial banks Figure 21. The liquidity ratio remained relatively steady at 44.2 percent, well above NBEs 20.0 percent minimum requirement. However, a loan-to-deposit ratio of 140.4 percent indicates that the sector is heavily dependent on borrowing from depositors and domestic banks.

Total assets also increased by 10.2 percent to Birr 5.4 billion, but total liquid assets declined by 15.1 percent to Birr 756.7 million. NPLs increased sharply by 132.8 percent in the year to end-June 2023 Table 10. This mainly represented a return the NPL ratio two years before, at 5.1 percent, afer a notable value of 2.8 percent a year earlier the ratio had been higher in previous years. The sectors asset quality at-end June 2023 was close to the regulatory maximum of 5.0 percent, implying a moderate credit risk. Source NBE Database In sum, overall risk of the microﬁnance sector is considered to be low and stable. The capital adequacy ratio, NPL ratio, and liquidity ratio are all well within NBEs parameters and have improved over the review period. There is also sufcient proﬁtability in the sector. However, the high credit concentration leaves MFIs susceptible to negative economic shocks that impact speciﬁc sectors such as agriculture and trade. Close links to the banking sector also makes the microﬁnance sector vulnerable to potential spillovers from the banking sector. These two risks may need to be addressed through appropriate policy measures.

At end-June 2023, the capital-to-risk weighted asset ratio was 52.0 percent, the lowest since 2019, while the debt-to-equity ratio reached 122.7 percent, the highest since 2019 but still far below the threshold debt-equity ratio of 71, which signals that the sector is still signiﬁcantly below its maximum borrowing capacity. In terms of proﬁtability, the capital goods ﬁnance sector has incurred losses in four out of the last ﬁve years, including in the most recent two. Return on capital and return on assets stood at 1.1 percent and 0.5 percent at end-June 2023, respectively Figure 23. This indicates a structural problem and high risk for the sustainability of operations, and it calls for corresponding policy measures to help the sector return to proﬁtability. Overall, the capital goods ﬁnance business sectors risk is rated as moderate and stable. Capital risk is assessed as low asset quality and systemic risk are rated moderate. However, earnings and concentration risks are rated high, and may require regulatory measures.

At end-June 2023, the insurance industry in Ethiopia consisted of one state-owned and 17 private insurers 12 operate in both general and long-term insurance and the remaining six in general insurance only. At present, there are no insurance companies dedicated exclusively to providing long-term coverage. In addition, one locally incorporated Reinsurance Company, around 2,716 insurance agents, 62 insurance brokers, 114 loss assessors and three surveyors are operating in the sector. Africa Re and PTA Reinsurance Company ZEP-RE, which have considerable presence in the sector, have contact ofces in Ethiopia. These two reinsurance companies transact their reinsurance business in local currency. NBE issued directives on minimum paid-up capital required for insurance companies and on risk-based internal audits. It also formulated a directive on external auditors, carries out both on-site inspections and of-site surveillance of insurance companies, and monitors the implementation of supervisory concerns to strengthen the resilience of insurance companies. A. Performance of the Sector At end-June 2023, total assets, liabilities, and capital of the insurance sector stood at Birr 49.7 billion, Birr 33.4 billion and Birr 16.3 billion, respectively Table 11. While general insurance accounted for 90 percent or more of each, life insurance remained a nascent business. The insurance industry accounted for slightly less than two percent of the total assets of the ﬁnancial sector, but saw an increase of 21.8 percent from the previous year. The growth in assets is largely attributed to the increase in current assets of bank deposits, which constituted 39.0 percent of total assets and increased by 34.7 percent from the previous year. The 21.8 percent growth of total assets was ﬁnanced by an increase in liabilities by Birr 6.0 billion 67.4 percent of the total asset increase and equity by Birr 2.9 billion, 32.6 percent of the total increase. 3.4 INSURANCE SECTOR 39 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA Source NBE Database The proﬁtability of the sector is sound. It generated a net income before tax of Birr 3.7 billion and Birr 0.4 billion from the general and long-term insurance business, respectively, corresponding to a return on equity of 25.0 percent for both classes of business. However, inﬂation led to losses on insurers ﬁxed income holdings of bank deposits, their largest asset class. Five-year average return on investment of the sector was 10.0 percent. The insurance sectors premium grew by 37.5 percent to Birr 22.9 billion at end-June 2023, roughly in line with the level of inﬂation or reﬂecting about zero real growth. Compared to 7.8 percent growth of life insurance, the general insurance business increased at a faster rate by 40.1 percent to reach Birr 21.5 billion see Annex D. Proﬁtability of the sector as measured by a combined ratio the aggregation of the loss ratio net incurred claims relative to net earned premium and the expense ratio underwriting expenses relative to net earned premium remained below 100 percent in 20192023, indicating that the sector is making proﬁts from insurance operations Figure 25. During this period, the historic loss-making motor class of the business exhibited improvements in claims ratio due to measures taken, which included increasing premium rates and a more cautious management of risks covered in this class of business.

Solvency ratio statutory capital to required capital which is expected not to fall below 100 percent, stood at 243.0 percent. The sector is liquid with a liquidity ratio of 94.6 percent Figure 26. B. Risk Assessment and Outlook The main risks faced by the insurance sector are insurance risk, operational risk, market risk, concentration risk, and risks due to the economic environment. Pressing concerns are market penetration, speciﬁcally in the life class of the business a shortage of insurance professionals such as actuaries and inadequate IT infrastructure in both the industry and regulatory body. Risks due to the economic environment Shortage of foreign currency for making premium payments to reinsurers signiﬁcantly afects the business of insurance companies. Reinsurers may decline to provide risk coverage, potentially cancelling existing contracts when insurers fail to remit premiums in foreign currency as per their reinsurance contract terms and conditions. In addition, the shortage of foreign currency has an impact on some classes of business such as marine insurance.

Nevertheless, SACCOs have limited capacity to increase their market share due to limitations in size, skills, products, and operational models to be truly competitive ﬁnancial institutions. From the point of view of ﬁnancial system stability, SACCOs pose no systemic risk due to the limited size of the sector. Pension funds Pension funds in Ethiopia are administered by two agencies. They are the Public Employees Social Security Administration Agency as per provisions of Proclamation No.12672022 and the Private Organization Employees Social Security Fund Administration Agency as per the provisions of Proclamation No. 12682022. Operational risk Lack of technical expertise in insurance is a real constraint. Most insurance companies operations continue to be underdeveloped and not automated. Insurance risk is the risk that inadequate or inappropriate underwriting, product design, pricing and claims settlement that expose an insurer to ﬁnancial loss and a consequent inability to meet its liabilities. Ethiopias insurance sector is known for its stif price competition in all classes of business. Insufcient premiums could lead players in the industry into failure to meet obligations from claims. Concentration risk The government-owned insurance corporation accounts for 30 percent of the market share. In addition, the Ethiopian Reinsurance Company receives 25 percent of treaty cession and 5 percent of each policy insurer underwrite. Moreover, 55 percent of the general class of business is motor insurance. Market Risk The investment portfolio of insurers is restricted to bank deposits and government bonds. Such provisions inhibit insurers from earning higher returns that could have encouraged further development of the sector. Insurance companies are encouraged to invest in accordance with the applicable directive, as the policy contracts issued are short-term and require insurers to hold more liquid assets. In sum, the industry is considered resilient and stable. NBE is currently taking steps to create an independent supervisory authority that is expected to have a positive impact on the performance of the industry. Technology development and automation are necessary to tackle operational risks.

FINANCIAL SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AND RISKS 4.1 NATIONAL PAYMENT SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT 4. FINANCIAL SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AND RISKS 4. FINANCIAL SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AND RISKS Payment systems in Ethiopia were radically modernized in 2011 afer NBE launched the Ethiopian Automated Transfer System EATS, a modern clearing and settlement system. NBE owns and manages the payment system infrastructure. It includes the Real-Time Gross Settlement system RTGS, which provides facilities for ﬁnal settlement of payments between ﬁnancial institutions 27 and the Automated Clearing House ACH, which provides clearing and netting services for bulk payments.28 Before 2011, all payments in the country, including bank-to-bank transfers, were made through the exchange of letters as a result, a single interbank transfer took days to be settled. The dependency of the ﬁnancial sector on the RTGS infrastructure has increased. Therefore, the safety and efciency of RTGS has become critical for the stability of the ﬁnancial system. The regulatory framework, which plays a very important role in this, needs to be constantly updated in line with technological and ﬁnancial sector developments. This chapter discusses developments and risks for the stability of Ethiopias ﬁnancial system related to the infrastructure of the ﬁnancial system. The infrastructure comprises currency management, the payment and settlement system, credit market infrastructure, and ﬁnancial inclusion consumer protection. 27 The RTGS is an electronic form of funds transfer for high value or sensitive payments, where money transfer takes places from one participant to another in real-time and on an individual basis. All participants maintain a payment and settlement account in RTGS for ﬁnal settlement of the transactions between them. 28 ACH is a system where low value large volume transactions bulk transactions are cleared and a net settlement instruction is produced. It is an electronic clearing house for cheque, Credit Transfer CT and Direct Debit DD instruments. In ACH, settlement does not happen rather, it produces net settlement instructions and sends them to RTGS for ﬁnal settlement. Each instrument, which is cleared in the ACH, requires a separate rule and arrangement. 45 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA 4.1.1 Payment Systems Performance A. Ethiopian Automated Transfer System Source NBE Database At end-June 2023, 32 ﬁnancial institutions had participated in EATS, of which two were MFIs. No major system interruption on EATS was reported in the year. The system processed more than Birr 3.9 million transactions up by 35.2 percent from the previous year with a value of more than Birr 4.8 trillion an annual increase of 28.7 percent. 46 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA Box 2 Payment System Regulatory Framework and Developments The legal and regulatory framework plays a critical role in creating a safe, secure, and efcient enabling environment for inclusive payment services. The national payment system Proclamation No. 7182011 and Proclamation No. 12822023, the payment system operators Directive No. ONPS022020 and the payment instrument Directive No. ONPS092023, among others, all constitute the current active regulatory framework to ensure the safety, security, and efciency of the national payment system. NBE has also taken initial steps toward enabling digital payments through the development of infrastructure, encouraging adoption of digital payments, revising regulations, and promoting innovation by launching National Digital Payments Strategy NDPS. The vision of the NDPS is to build a secure, competitive, efcient, innovative, and responsible payment ecosystem to support a cash-lite and ﬁnancially inclusive economy.

Mobile Money Agents The number of mobile money agents increased by almost half 48.5 percent from the previous year and reached over 233 thousand at end-June 2023. The increase is mainly attributed to the entry of Telebirr in the market. POS The number of POS terminals deployed within ﬁnancial institutions and at merchant locations increased slightly from the previous year by 2.2 percent to 12,016 at end-June 2023. Going forward, they are expected to expand further at a faster rate through the concerted efort of the private sector and the relevant authorities. Debit Cards The number of debit cards rose from the previous year by 25.1 percent to 38.4 million at end-June 2023 a three and half fold increase in just four years. Mobile Banking Currently, mobile banking is considered to be the most convenient and accessible digital payment channel. Consequently, the number of registered accounts increased from the previous year by two-thirds 67.5 percent to 27.3 million at end-June 2023. Table 13 DFS Access Points channels and instruments, 2019-2023 number B. Digital Financial Services DFSs Following a recent NBE directive, domestic non-bank payment service providers are allowed to issue electronic money instruments andor obtain a payment systems operator license to provide payment and remittance services.

The rapid growth was largely attributed to the introduction of Telebirr mobile money services by Ethio-telecom. Internet banking is still relatively in its infancy with 6.8 million users at end-June 2023 but is growing rapidly. Digital payments are growing at an exponential rate Table 14. At end-June 2023, payments worth more than Birr 4.7 trillion were processed digitally, almost three times the value of the previous year. This growth is the result of successful implementation of the National Digital Payment Strategy and NBEs reform activities. Interoperability is key to a stable, successful, and inclusive digital payment ecosystem. The vast majority of countries worldwide have recognized the importance of a local switch that covers three functions enabling interoperability through ATMs, POS devices, P2P, electronic payments, and more providing an optimal infrastructure for banks to connect to and allowing real-time payments 247. The successful attainment of a local switch addressing these three items creates a strong foundation for the scaling-up of digital payments by promoting quick, safe, and efcient transactions. Eth-switch, since 2016, has enabled interoperability of ATMs and POS terminals operated by all banks. As a result, the number and value of transactions have grown exponentially Table 15. Currently, it is also rolling out projects to achieve the interoperability of other digital payment platforms operated by all ﬁnancial service providers in Ethiopia.

Accordingly, it is important for a banks risk management practices and internal controls to evolve and keep up with changes in the banks payment systems, products, and services. Like any other system globally, developments in the countrys payment system are exposed to several risks, including operational, liquidity, compliance, reputation, settlement, and cybersecurity risks. Operational risks refer to potential disruptions in the functioning of payment systems due to factors such as system failures, human errors, and operational deﬁciencies. The consequences of such risks can be far-reaching, including ﬁnancial losses, reputational damage, and disruptions in ﬁnancial services. No major disruptions hindering the smooth functioning of the payment system were reported at end-June 2023. However, maintenance of the operational resilience of the payment system in the future requires implementing and upgrading a robust IT infrastructure with redundancy, regularly testing disaster recovery, and business continuity plans. Liquidity risk refers to the risk for participants from lack of sufcient funds to meet their settlement obligations, which leads to disruptions in the smooth functioning of the system and settlement failure. This reduces the efciency and reliability of the payment system, afecting peer participants and their clients. At end-June 2023, short term liquidity problems were seen on the system by a few participants. NBE is working closely with the participants to resolve the issue. Compliance risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences from failure to comply with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards, leading to increased exposure to other risks such as operational, credit, and liquidity risks.

Its main purpose was to lessen the difculty of getting adequate and timely credit information that enables the satisfactory assessment of credit worthiness of borrowers in the banking sector. This will improve the loan portfolio and the stability of the banking system. Initially, credit information was made available to lending banks manually, and banks were mandated to grant loans and advances of Birr 200,000 or more only afer ﬁrst obtaining information from the Credit Information Centre. The system was upgraded and expanded in 2012 and then in 2019, 29 incorporating MFIs and Capital Goods Financing Companies as subscribers, data providers and users. 50 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA 2023, no major compliance issues were registered. NBE has established robust regulatory frameworks to reduce the likelihood of non-compliance, and maintains a strong reputation for adherence to legal and regulatory standards. Reputation risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences arising from negative public perception or damage to the payment system's failure to perform as expected, leading to loss of trust among participants, customers, and the public. At end-June 2023, no event occurred that would have led to a loss of trust from participants and customers. NBE will continue to regularly monitor the payment system to mitigate any potential risk. Cybersecurity risks Globally, attacks on information and communication technology systems cyber-attacks are increasing, targeting mainly the ﬁnancial sector. This poses signiﬁcant threat, among others, to the integrity, conﬁdentiality, and availability of ﬁnancial transactions, leading to data breaches, disruptions of services, fraudulent transactions, and reputational damage. At end-June 2023, no cybersecurity threats were reported to NBE by participants of EATS and by other DFS providers. Strong security controls, vendor security assessments, the establishment of redundant and backup systems, and collaboration with law enforcement agencies can reduce this risk and ofer better protection against potential threats. Overall, the national payment system is considered to be safe, efcient, and trusted by users and it shall remain so going forward. The EATS and DFS products are expected to show continuous growth both in value and volume, and will continue to evolve and contribute to ﬁnancial stability in Ethiopia. 29 NBE Directive No. CRB022019 as amended 4.3 FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION Table 16 Credit Reference Bureau Statistics, 2019-2023 In sum, the expansion in CRS coverage has contributed substantially to ensuring an adequate loan portfolio in the banking and MFI industries. Going forward, modern- ization of the CRS including upgrading of the IT infrastructure, modernization and streamlining of databases, and updating of the service level agreements will ensure that CRS operational risk remains stable. Financial inclusion is an essential prerequisite for sustainable development and will play a key role in the stability of the countrys ﬁnancial system, job creation, digital transformation, and Ethiopias continued economic growth. It is a national priority and NBEs long-standing target. Financial inclusion makes a positive contribution to the stability of the ﬁnancial sector by broadening the customer and deposit bases of ﬁnancial institutions. It allows ﬁnancial institutions to access diversiﬁed funding sources and improve their ability to manage their liquidity risks. In response to these policy objectives, the ﬁrst National Financial Inclusion Strategy of Ethiopia was implemented for ﬁve consecutive years 20162020, enabling ground-breaking regulatory and ﬁnancial infrastructure improvements. The second National Financial Inclusion Strategy NFIS-II was issued in 2021 and will be imple- mented until 2025. It envisions achieving universal, high-quality, and sustainable ﬁnancial inclusion and ensuring that 70.0 percent of adults are included by 2025. Complementing the NFIS-II, NBE put into efect the National Financial Education Strategy in 2021 to address the ﬁnancial capability and awareness gap among Ethiopian adults. Source NBE Database 51 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA At end-June 2023, the total number of borrowers registered in the Credit Reference System CRS database stood at almost 4.4 million, a 1,992 percent increase from the previous year. The surge was mainly the consequence of incorporating borrowers from MFIs in the database. All banks and MFIs a combined total of 83 are subscribers to the CRS.

The adoption and usage of mobile money has increased by 60.0 percent and reached 69.6 million mobile accounts in June 2023, against 43.5 million a year before. The total number of credit accounts increased from 4.7 million in June 2022 to 6.5 million in June 2023 and accounted for a 38.3 percent growth rate Figure 27. During the year, there were a total of 2.3 million new digital credit users. Credit accounts per 100 adults reached 11.4 at end-June 2023 against 8.6 at end-June 2022, turning around the decrease in the preceding years afected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial consumer protection is another important intervention area by NBE. The Bank aims to enhance the trust and conﬁdence of the general public by ensuring the protection of their interests. At the end of August 2020, NBE issued the Financial Consumer Protection Directive FCP012020 to promote ﬁnancial inclusion, ensure ﬁnancial stability and stimulate growth, innovation, and efciency in the ﬁnancial system. In 2023, NBE established a directorate dedicated to the supervision of the market, dispute resolution, and ﬁnancial education to ensure ﬁnancial consumer rights are fully protected and market conﬁdence is maintained. 52 FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT NATIONAL BANK OF ETHIOPIA Jun-19 JUN-20 JUN-21 JUN-22 JUN-23 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 Number of Credit accounts in Million Number of Credit accounts per 100 adults 5.7 5.6 5.4 4.7 6.5 10.8 10.2 9.1 8.6 11.4 Figure 28 DBE Major Balance Sheet Items, June 2022-2023 billion Birr Table 17 DBE Key Balance Sheet Items and Ratios, June 2022-2023 Source DBE Source DBE ANNEX ANNEX A.
