SUMMARY Recent Developments and Year-Ahead Outlook Growth Compared to last years 9 percent outturn, GDP growth should slow slightly this year due to some of the tightening measures being implemented to reduce credit growth to the government and state enterprises. However, as recent agriculture data show a solid harvest up almost 5 percent and various proxies for construction and service activity point to near double-digit expansion in these large sub-sectors, we dont expect a major slowdown and see a decent chance that growth will reach 8 percent for the year. The IMF forecasts 6.2 percent growth this year, which exaggerates the scale of the expected slowdown, in our view. Inflation Ethiopias inflation rate remains in the range of 18-19 percent at the start of 2020 and this high rate has now spread to services such as housing and transport whose inflation rate was until recentlyonly around 10 percent for an extended period. An inflation rate in the low- to mid-teens will likely persist for most of 2020, though a reduction towards 10 percent should be possible given tight limits now placed on base money growthtowards the end of the year. While central bank policies will work to reduce inflation, supply-side shocks such as potential domestic disruptions linked to elections could affect food prices and keep inflation high this is not our baseline expectation but is a noteworthy risk. Investment While some components of investment e.g. FDI are stalling, total investment should still remain at around 33-35 percent of GDP this fiscal year given high government capital spending and the substantial credit expansion taking place at private banks with its associated private domestic investment. Fiscal Even with a Birr 28bn Supplementary Budget being added this month, fiscal deficit outturns for the year shoulddue to extra available resourcescome in close to the initial budgeted figures below 3 of GDP, while the debt ratio will decline markedly to 52 percent of GDP by June 2020. Judging by commitments in the macro program, the fiscal year starting in July 2020 will show a 2.5 of GDP budget deficit, while debt ratios should remain broadly unchanged. Quarterly Macroeconomic Review Fourth Quarter 2019 Macro Research Ethiopia RESEARCH ANALYTICS February 28, 2020 RESEARCH ANALYTICS Banking and credit Credit conditions for private business improved last year and should continue to do so in 2020, as the end of NBE Bill purchase requirements allows private banks to boost lending to the private sector. Recent liquidity problems due to weak asset-liability management by banks should be short-lived and lending growth at private banks is on track to reach 40 percent for the fiscal year judging from end-December outturns reflecting this, plus improved fx inflows at most banks, profits at private banks will pass Birr 14bn this year, by our estimates, vs Birr 11bn last year. Foreign exchange Despite a somewhat faster pace of monthly exchange rate adjustment, fx conditions will remain challenging this year given the backlog of unmet fx demand and the gradual pace of some large expected fx inflows i.e., privatization. The gap between the official and parallel market rates is now roughly 25 percent notably lower than last years gap of 37 percent but substantial nonetheless. The Governments IMF-supported macro program takes a gradual approach to addressing Ethiopias exchange rate misalignment though we would have expectedand liked to have seena quicker correction. Reflecting this state of affairs, businesses seeking foreign exchange will continue to face extended waiting times at banks till at least the end of 2020, though planned reforms to the fx market including a promised review of policies in this area being prepared by April 2020 couldif substantivehelp reduce and remove fx waiting times at banks next year. Risks Given planned elections this year, public confidence and business sentiment may turn cautious or negative during the year leading to cutbacks in investment and thus lower growth, but risks in this area are offset somewhat by on-going improvements in macro policies and by the continuation of structural reforms privatization, PPPs, job creation initiatives, and ease of doing business reforms. A relatively stable socio-political environment for the remainder of the year will remain critical to avoid an interruption of Ethiopias recent investment and growth recordand indeed forms the basis for our baseline macro projections.

RESEARCH ANALYTICS ECONOMIC ACTIVITY Recent Developments and Outlook Recently released agricultural data show this years crop harvest was 32.9mn tons, up 4.3 percent, and in line with our forecasts last year. Total acreage cultivated during the crop season was 12.8 mn hectares unchanged from a year- ago which gives an average yieldacross all cropsof 2.58 tons per hectare. Yields were up by 4 percent from year-ago, and so virtually all of the observed crop increase was driven by improved yields rather than increasing hectares farmed. The growth of 4.3 percent seen for crops is somewhat below the long-term average, given the 6.2 percent average annual growth seen for Ethiopias crop sector over the past decade. Among cereals, growth was particularly strong for teff and maize both up 7.5 percent as well as wheat up 4.1 percent these three cropstogether with sorghum and barleymake up Ethiopias top 5 cereal crops. Among pulses and oilseeds, the strongest growth was seen in soya beans, mung beans, and oilseedsall of which grew strongly from depressed levels in the prior year.

FAO reviews as of February 2020 show that most of the locust infestations occurred either in areas with limited crop production or well after Ethiopias harvest season. Moreover, estimates of locust-infested areas by the Ministry of Agriculture are that a total of 70,000 hectares have been affected across different parts of the country. This figure is only 0.55 percent of Ethiopias total crop land 12.7 million hectares. Even if all the crops in those affected areas were assumed lost an extreme case, the impact on the overall economy would be just 0.2 percent of GDP as crop output is just 33 percent total GDP.

The weak spots include a slowdown in FDI inflows down 25 percent for the first six months of the fiscal year, a slower rate of SOE bond borrowing negative in real terms and suggesting lower investment, lower capital goods imports, and a moderation of deposit growth at banks. Areas suggesting still-positive and expanding economic activity include tax collections up 29 percent in nominal terms, or 13 percent in real terms, lending growth up 31 percent in nominal terms, industrial park exports, tourist arrivals, and fuel consumption in volume terms.

EIC RESEARCH ANALYTICS Growth outlookcontinued Taken all together, i.e., considering 4 percent crop growth as well as proxies for construction and services activity, we expect that overall GDP growth can reach 8 percent for the fiscal year. Our growth projection is somewhat above the average growth forecasts of various institutions, per our compilation. Our slightly higher projection versus the average of all others likely reflects our incorporation of recent data on this years crop harvest and of end-December banking, tax, and services indicators.

After an extended period of moderate inflation, services inflation is now nearing 20 percent, driven by items such as housing, electricity, and transport costs. We find the persistence of inflation inconsistent with some recent developments i.e., positive food harvests, restored transport links, and moderating money supply growth, and its underlying sources may thus be better explained and driven by self-fulfilling public expectations. If expectations have become the dominant influence for inflation, only a convincing break from past policies and a disciplining macro framework can help alter expectationsin which case the recent Govt-IMF macro program may begin to make a difference.

Inflation projections If the current pattern of month-on-month figures continues to mid-year, then inflation should begin to fall sharply by June 2020, as the index showed large jumps in mid-2019 and comparisons to mid-2020 will show more moderate year-on-year price increases. Though inflation has become difficult to forecast, and could continue to show one or two months of upside surprises in the period ahead, we still see it falling to around 13 percent by mid-June and to near 10 percent by December.

With nominal GDP growth expected to be above 26 percent this year, the ratio of broad money to GDP will be falling this year pointing to a decline in monetization, or the ratio of money-to-GDP, within the economy. Reserve money growth had fallen substantially at end-September but has now reverted back to growth of 15 percent. This is likely to moderate for the period ahead, given a 12.5 percent growth target set under the Government-IMF macro program.

FISCAL POLICY Recent developments Revenue performance Tax collections continue to post positive results Birr 127bn in six months, with the latest reading at end- December up 29 percent from last year. Trade taxes, which are boosted by the faster depreciation, did particularly well with growth of 44 percent from year-ago levels. Budget performance Full budget data including expenditure outturns are only available up to Sept 2019 and show spending growing in line with revenue growth, and the deficit appears to be in line with year-total levels 91bn for the fiscal year.

Public debt is now almost exactly split evenly between domestic and external debt Public debt, relative to GDP Relative to this years anticipated USD GDP, public debt as of Sept 2019 fell to just 48.9 of GDP. As new loans are contracted up to June 2020, this figure will rise modestly and should end the fiscal year in the low 50s as a share of GDP. External debt stocks Total external debt is now just below 25 percent of USD GDP, one of the lowest levels in years.

The outturns for the first quarter of the fiscal year point to a marked drop in reserves that quarter, reflecting a drop in several current account items services exports, remittances and grants as well as large public sector debt repayments. Some of these items appear to have reversed, however, as reserves rose in the second quarter of the fiscal year see below. FX reserves Fx reserves were around 3bn at end-December 2019, despite having dropped to as low as 2.6bn in Sept 2019. Official inflows, particularly funding received as part of the IMF program approved in Dec 2019, are likely to explain the year-end increase to near 3bn.

Given 1.3bn in six-month exports, the full year export figure is unlikely to exceed 3bn. We forecast 8 percent growth in exports this year, for a full year figure of 2.9bn. Among large-value exports, the best performing exports this past quarter were flowers, fruits and vegetables, live animals, and textile products. Some export sub- components are showing record high levels, including flowers and textile products. On current trends, flowers are likely to become Ethiopias second largest export after coffee, and textiles will not be that far behind potentially fourth largest overall within the coming year.

However, a closer look at the data shows that this partly reflects declines in one-off aircraft imports -94 and in reduced fuel imports due to lower global oil prices -6. Excluding these two items, non-fuel and non-aircraft imports grew by 5 percent. Consumer goods were down 6 percent, likely reflecting the faster recent depreciation and an adjustment away from higher-cost consumer items. Capital goods imports were down overallbut mainly due to declines in aircraft imports. Capital goods related to agriculture were up 57 and those related to industry up 6.

The exchange rate has now depreciated by 14 percent from year-ago levels 32.28 at end-February 2020 vs 28.34 at end February 2019. Continuing the current pace of Birr depreciation, i.e. 22 cents per month, would move the exchange rate by 8 percent in a years time. We think the central bank would aim for a somewhat higher annual rate of depreciation, given inflation differentials between Ethiopia and its trading partners and the need to maintain external competitiveness. An annual depreciation of between 10-15 percent is thus more likely to be targeted, in our view, implying somewhat higher monthly depreciations in the latter half of 2020.
